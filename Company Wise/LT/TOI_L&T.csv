Larsen and Toubro will construct the 46 km rail line connecting Heelalige, located in the southern part of the city near Electronic City and Bommasandra Industrial area, to Rajankunte, a suburban area in the northern part of the city.On Saturday, the KRIDE issued a letter of acceptance to the contractor for design and construction of elevated line for length of 8.960 km and at grade length of 37.920 km. However, the contract does not cover construction of the 19 railway stations proposed on this corridor. The project cost is Rs 1040 crore. The contractor will also build a double -decker alignment of 1.2 km that will accomodate Majestic – Devanahalli and Heelalige-Rajankunte line near Yelahanka. At Benniganahalli, the proposed suburban rail for a length of 500 meter will be built below the Namma Metro line. The KRIDE claims that shared alignment (common right of way) at Benniganahalli is the first of its kind project in the country.Earlier, the KRIDE had awarded a tender for the same contractor for building Corridor 2 from Byappanahalli to Chikkabanavara for a length of 25 km.The officials maintain that tender for other two corridors Majestic to Devanahalli like Kempegowda International Airport and Kengeri to Whitefield will be invited shortly. Recently, the KRIDE signed a loan agreement with German Development Bank, KfW for Euro 500 million and in March, 2024 an agreement will be signed to raise Euro 300 million from European Investment Bank (EIB). This loan agreement will help the KRIDE to fund upcoming projects. While sanctioning the project in 2020, the Central Government had set a six years deadline to complete 148 km of rail network for the city. No consensus on allotment of railway landMeanwhile, the tussle over handing over of railway land required for the Corridor -4 has continued. The KRIDE had approached the South Western Railway (SWR) seeking transfer 46 km line. The SWR had earlier maintained that KRIDE is asking for the excess of land than initially estimated for the project and it will go by the directions of the Railway Ministry. Non-availability of the land delayed the awarding of the tender for months. However, the KRIDE hopes that transfer of required land would happen at the earliest. The agency needs 115 acres of land to build the new rail line. Caption : Illustration for suburban rail story First photo: 1.

When he returned home on Monday, government officials and locals warmly felicitated Aulakh, expressing their gratitude for his Herculean efforts.According to BK Sharma, the section officer at L&T’s Lakhwar project in Dehradun, Aulakh was part of the technical team called to assist in the evacuation operation. During a tense moment when the initial augur machine failed to cut through the debris, Aulakh contributed heroically by laying a six-inch-wide pipeline through the debris on November 20 under the supervision of both foreign and indigenous experts. This pipeline enabled the supply of food and essential items to the trapped workers, Sharma said.Aulakh, belonging to a farming family in Pilibhit district, attributed his courageous contribution to God and his elder brother, Manvir Singh. He credited his brother for instilling in him the determination not to give up until the final goal was achieved.Ashutosh Gupta, the sub-divisional magistrate of Kalinagar circle, visited Aulakh's farmhouse on Monday evening with an official team to felicitate him. Commending Aulakh's role, Gupta praised him for setting an exemplary display of duty, diligence, and passion, likening his efforts to that of a soldier.Manvir Singh, Aulakh's brother, described Harjinder as someone who was less inclined toward academics but highly skilled in technical work. He said, “Aulakh discontinued formal education after tenth grade and pursued mechanical work instead. He started working overseas at the age of 22, moving between companies in Qatar, Bahrain, Dubai, and Muscat. Eventually, he returned to India and joined L&T in Dehradun as a lifting foreman four months ago, fulfilling our family's desire for him to come back to our homeland.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/pilibhit-man-returns-home-to-heros-welcome-after-silkyara-rescue-mission/articleshow/106141287.cms

Larsen and Toubro (L&T) has been finalised as the agency that will take up the tunnelling work of the ambitious project, which will exhibit the art, culture, and heritage of Bihar.The work on the 1.5-km-long tunnel that will pass through Patna Museum, Vidyapati Marg, Planetarium crossing, Income Tax roundabout, Patna Women's College, and Bihar Museum, will begin on December 20 this year. The officials of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, the nodal agency for the project, say that the lowering of the diaphragm wall (D-wall), the concrete structure to demarcate the tunnel area, in the shaft will commence by the end of January 2024.“The tender was awarded to L&T about a week ago to construct a unique heritage tunnel between two city museums and the preliminary work will start from December 20. Two shafts will be constructed, each at the Patna Museum and the new Bihar Museum. In these shafts, the D-wall will be lowered following which the tunnel boring machine (TBM) will be put into use,” the officials told TOI on Saturday.TBM is an integral part of the project as it bores the earth, builds tunnels, and helps in creating the underground network for the subway. The tunnel will be built using the latest technology and will ensure the safety of the visitors. The width of the tunnel will be 8 meters and TBM will be used at the depth of 16.5 meters.The officials said that the subway tunnel will run about 15 to 20 meters below the ground level and the Patna metro rail tunnel will pass at a depth of 29 meters at the crossing point. There will be a vertical clearance of about 6.5 meters between the subway tunnel and the Patna metro rail tunnel at the crossing point below Bailey Road. There is also provision for combined ticketing and unencumbered transition from the metro system.The entry and exit points will have a G+1 structure with three-level basements along with the security checks. The tunnel will be fully air-conditioned and laced with two lifts on both ends, stairs, and a pedestrian walkway, for those willing to walk the distance. There is also provision for battery-operated golf carts to aid easy and eco-friendly movement of the visitors. The other facilities in the tunnel include fire safety measures, CCTV cameras, lights, LED screens, and drainage systems.As per the detailed project report, the tunnel itself will be an art gallery and people will get a glimpse of the state’s culture through artwork such as murals and paintings (including Madhubani painting) among other artifacts, which will adorn the walls of the tunnel.The project is expected to complete within three years by utilising the funds to the tune of Rs 542 crore.

Larsen and Toubro will construct the 46 km rail line connecting Heelalige, located in the southern part of the city near Electronic City and Bommasandra Industrial area, to Rajankunte, a suburban area in the northern part of the city.On Saturday, the KRIDE issued a letter of acceptance to the contractor for design and construction of elevated line for length of 8.960 km and at grade length of 37.920 km. However, the contract does not cover construction of the 19 railway stations proposed on this corridor. The project cost is Rs 1040 crore. The contractor will also build a double -decker alignment of 1.2 km that will accomodate Majestic – Devanahalli and Heelalige-Rajankunte line near Yelahanka. At Benniganahalli, the proposed suburban rail for a length of 500 meter will be built below the Namma Metro line. The KRIDE claims that shared alignment (common right of way) at Benniganahalli is the first of its kind project in the country.Earlier, the KRIDE had awarded a tender for the same contractor for building Corridor 2 from Byappanahalli to Chikkabanavara for a length of 25 km.The officials maintain that tender for other two corridors Majestic to Devanahalli like Kempegowda International Airport and Kengeri to Whitefield will be invited shortly. Recently, the KRIDE signed a loan agreement with German Development Bank, KfW for Euro 500 million and in March, 2024 an agreement will be signed to raise Euro 300 million from European Investment Bank (EIB). This loan agreement will help the KRIDE to fund upcoming projects. While sanctioning the project in 2020, the Central Government had set a six years deadline to complete 148 km of rail network for the city. No consensus on allotment of railway landMeanwhile, the tussle over handing over of railway land required for the Corridor -4 has continued. The KRIDE had approached the South Western Railway (SWR) seeking transfer 46 km line. The SWR had earlier maintained that KRIDE is asking for the excess of land than initially estimated for the project and it will go by the directions of the Railway Ministry.

When he returned home on Monday, government officials and locals warmly felicitated Aulakh, expressing their gratitude for his Herculean efforts.According to BK Sharma, the section officer at L&T’s Lakhwar project in Dehradun, Aulakh was part of the technical team called to assist in the evacuation operation. During a tense moment when the initial augur machine failed to cut through the debris, Aulakh contributed heroically by laying a six-inch-wide pipeline through the debris on November 20 under the supervision of both foreign and indigenous experts. This pipeline enabled the supply of food and essential items to the trapped workers, Sharma said.Aulakh, belonging to a farming family in Pilibhit district, attributed his courageous contribution to God and his elder brother, Manvir Singh. He credited his brother for instilling in him the determination not to give up until the final goal was achieved.Ashutosh Gupta, the sub-divisional magistrate of Kalinagar circle, visited Aulakh's farmhouse on Monday evening with an official team to felicitate him. Commending Aulakh's role, Gupta praised him for setting an exemplary display of duty, diligence, and passion, likening his efforts to that of a soldier.Manvir Singh, Aulakh's brother, described Harjinder as someone who was less inclined toward academics but highly skilled in technical work. He said, “Aulakh discontinued formal education after tenth grade and pursued mechanical work instead. He started working overseas at the age of 22, moving between companies in Qatar, Bahrain, Dubai, and Muscat. Eventually, he returned to India and joined L&T in Dehradun as a lifting foreman four months ago, fulfilling our family's desire for him to come back to our homeland.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/pilibhit-man-returns-home-to-heros-welcome-after-silkyara-rescue-mission/articleshow/106141287.cms

Larsen and Toubro (L&T) has been finalised as the agency that will take up the tunnelling work of the ambitious project, which will exhibit the art, culture, and heritage of Bihar.The work on the 1.5-km-long tunnel that will pass through Patna Museum, Vidyapati Marg, Planetarium crossing, Income Tax roundabout, Patna Women's College, and Bihar Museum, will begin on December 20 this year. The officials of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, the nodal agency for the project, say that the lowering of the diaphragm wall (D-wall), the concrete structure to demarcate the tunnel area, in the shaft will commence by the end of January 2024.“The tender was awarded to L&T about a week ago to construct a unique heritage tunnel between two city museums and the preliminary work will start from December 20. Two shafts will be constructed, each at the Patna Museum and the new Bihar Museum. In these shafts, the D-wall will be lowered following which the tunnel boring machine (TBM) will be put into use,” the officials told TOI on Saturday.TBM is an integral part of the project as it bores the earth, builds tunnels, and helps in creating the underground network for the subway. The tunnel will be built using the latest technology and will ensure the safety of the visitors. The width of the tunnel will be 8 meters and TBM will be used at the depth of 16.5 meters.The officials said that the subway tunnel will run about 15 to 20 meters below the ground level and the Patna metro rail tunnel will pass at a depth of 29 meters at the crossing point. There will be a vertical clearance of about 6.5 meters between the subway tunnel and the Patna metro rail tunnel at the crossing point below Bailey Road. There is also provision for combined ticketing and unencumbered transition from the metro system.The entry and exit points will have a G+1 structure with three-level basements along with the security checks. The tunnel will be fully air-conditioned and laced with two lifts on both ends, stairs, and a pedestrian walkway, for those willing to walk the distance. There is also provision for battery-operated golf carts to aid easy and eco-friendly movement of the visitors. The other facilities in the tunnel include fire safety measures, CCTV cameras, lights, LED screens, and drainage systems.As per the detailed project report, the tunnel itself will be an art gallery and people will get a glimpse of the state’s culture through artwork such as murals and paintings (including Madhubani painting) among other artifacts, which will adorn the walls of the tunnel.The project is expected to complete within three years by utilising the funds to the tune of Rs 542 crore. It was conceptualised in August 2019 following directions from chief minister Nitish Kumar.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/construction-of-tunnel-betweenmuseums-to-begin-from-dec-20/articleshow/105872017.cms

Naik, however, is expected to continue to wield influence over L&T’s affairs as he will remain chairman of L&T Employee Trust, the single largest shareholder of the Rs 1.9­lakh­crore enterprise. While Subrahmanyan will be re­designated as chairman and MD, L&T sees no legal basis to appoint a CEO in his place.

""We are hopeful of a decision soon on how to go about the project considering that the price quoted by the lowest bidder is much higher than the estimated cost. The bids are in the evaluation stage,"" said an official.The railways had set the target to bid out the project in April so that work could start in the next couple of months. The redevelopment of NDRS, which sees 4.5 lakh footfall daily, will take at least two years.The revamped station will have two unique twin domes having four floors of ""roof plazas"" creating additional space of about 15 acres. The roof plaza will be 10 meters above the track and there will be complete segregation of arrival and departure to avoid crowding. There will be a network of elevated roads around the twin domes.

Targeting to bid out the project in April, the railways has made an elaborate plan to divert several mail and express trains to other stations in the national capital and its suburbs and to allow some trains to bypass Delhi, which use the New Delhi station only as a transit station.98573562Officials said the New Delhi station, which sees 4.5 lakh footfall daily and the maximum long distance passengers, gets around 249 mail and express trains. They added managing so many trains during the redevelopment work would be a tough task. It also handles another 150 trains daily, which include local passenger and freight trains.The Northern Railway has identified over half a dozen stations in Delhi and its vicinity which will be used for origin and termination of several of these trains.These include Old Delhi, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar, Safdarjung, Sabji Mandi, Tilak Bridge, Sarai Rohilla, Bijwasan and Faridabad.""We have a three-pronged strategy to manage the situation and to minimise the inconvenience to passengers. While the origin and destination of several trains will be changed from New Delhi station, we will also allow some trains to bypass Delhi by taking the available alternate routes. The planning is being optimised to see that there is minimum or no cancellation of any train,"" a railway ministry official said.The Northern Railways will take up the redevelopment work in phases impacting at a time only 4-5 platforms. Officials said this will ensure that the remaining platforms can be used for arrival and departure of trains.Since the redevelopment work will take at least two years, the railways will hold consultations with Delhi Transport Corporation and the transport department to see how more buses can be operated from the stations that will get more passengers because of shifting the origin and destination of so many trains.Officials said they are hopeful that full-scale work would start by this September as utility shifting would take around four months.The revamped New Delhi railway station will have two unique twin domes having four floors of ""roof plazas"" creating additional space of about 15 acres. The focus of the plans has been to ensure smooth traffic flow and maximum convenience to passengers at the stations.The roof plaza will be 10 metres above the track and there will be complete segregation of arrival and departure to avoid any crowding.

Now the court order comes as a reprieve as the NHAI can resume its work after a gap of nearly a month. The mining and geology department had issued the stop memo citing overexploitation of the land allotted for excavation, and the panchayat cited the safety of a road that passes adjoining the land for issuing the stop memo.The high court has also directed the panchayat and the police to ensure the safety of the road during excavation. It has asked the department to issue permission for resuming excavation at the earliest to avoid further delays in completing the project. Earlier, the mining and geology department had asked the NHAI to pay a penalty of Rs 6 lakh for overexploitation of land. The court has directed the NHAI to deposit the amount with the court until a decision is made on the appeal.The court has also directed the government pleader to issue a notice to the mining department, local body, district police chief, and station house officer concerned to aid NHAI in resuming excavation at the earliest. After the stop memos were issued on December 6, Larsen and Toubro Limited, the agency entrusted with the excavation, approached the high court with a plea to quash the stop memos. In October, the department provided permission for the excavation of soil from 0.471 hectares of land owned by a person at Palkulangara in Perumkadavila. The construction of the 16.3-kilometre Mukkola-Karode bypass is almost complete, with only an 800-meter stretch remaining to be finished at Thenkavila, Thirupuram, and Vlathankara areas. ""We wanted 75,000 metric tonnes of soil from the said land when we started excavation. Nearly 25,000 metric tonnes of soil have been excavated so far, and we still need 50,000 metric tonnes more to finish the work. The permission was granted for excavation till December 31 and there are only four more days remaining. Meanwhile, we are unable to collect required soil because we have lost over a month's worth of work as a result of the litigation,"" said Pradeep S., project director at NHAI. He said that the required amount of soil cannot be taken from the land, and they have to identify at least two more lands for excavation. ""If we do not get enough soil, the work cannot be finished on time,"" he said. The NHAI is planning to finish the work by March, 2023.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/hc-stays-stop-memo-given-to-nhai-on-soil-excavation/articleshow/96558052.cms

L&T, w","PANAJI: Construction conglomerate Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) has kick started the process to rectify the frequent potholes that erupt on the Atal Setu. L&T, which built the bridge for Rs 546 crore, will remove all the asphalt and tar on the bridge and replace it with a fresh layer of bitumen, a process that will take at least four months, said Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) officials.GSIDC has closed the Ponda Porvorim ramp for traffic to enable L&T to remove the present asphalt layer. Around mid January, GSIDC will partially close Atal Setu so that work can start on the main part of the bridge.“IIT Madras has recommended that the entire asphalt that has been laid has to be removed, including the membrane because it is not appropriate for Goa’s climate. It has asked us to use the traditional method to hotmix the roads,” said a GSIDC official.The traditional method involves putting a layer of mastic asphalt, which is considered to be reliable with a long and proven track record in road construction. The Ponda Panaji arm of the Atal Setu, which is yet to be opened for the traffic, will also be completed and opened up for use, GSIDC officials said.Hastily inaugurated in January 2019, the Atal Setu remains incomplete and has become an expensive liability for L&T. With a five-year defect liability period in place, L&T will foot the bill for the current repairs.GSIDC had written to the North Goa collector for permission to repair Atal Setu from December 1, but the permission was kept on hold due to the arrival of the Prime Minister. “The entire bridge will not be shut for four months. We will close just one lane of traffic each time and traffic will be allowed to use the other lane,” the GSIDC engineer said. The recurring potholes on the bridge created a headache for motorists, traffic police and GSIDC officials. Several motorists have met with accidents after swerving to avoid potholes. Goa police subsequently imposed speed restrictions of 50 kmph.“This is the peak tourism season and we don’t want to create inconvenience. Once the number of tourists in the state reduces in January, we will start work on the entire bridge,” said the GSIDC official.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/lt-begins-repairing-atal-setu-work-to-be-completed-in-four-months/articleshow/96287525.cms

The company’s chief executive officer & MD Amit Chadha told TOI that clients are being cautious. “If it does not have to be done today, or does not add up to the bottom-line or top-line, it is getting pushed,” Chadha told TOI after the company announced its results for the quarter ended September. Hi-tech is one of the top segments for LTTS, accounting for 19.4% of revenue. In the September quarter, the revenue from hi-tech fell by 1.3% sequentially.Chadha said in the last quarter, the company had asked its non-billable assets to upskill to become billable. That was necessary, he said, to improve utilisation and “stay in the 18% EBIT band.”On moonlighting, Chadha said that while employees are allowed to use their skills to teach or engage in CSR activities, they are not allowed to work on contract where there is a conflict of interest. “I have data privacy guidelines and I’m worried about what is getting shared out in the open about my client,” Chadha said. LTTS clocked a revenue of $247.1 million in the September quarter, a growth of 18% YoY in constant currency, and 4.5% sequentially. LTTS sees transportation as one of the strongest sectors where it can grow. It has been working with major EV players.

Our robust first quarter performance has reinforced confidence in our ability to continue our growth momentum,"" Chatterjee said.On whether signs of a global slowdown are beginning to show, the Mindtree boss said there are ""no indications yet of any significant change in client behaviour"".""Digital transformation is not a one-off project, but an ongoing imperative,"" he observed.The company will continue to closely monitor near-term macroeconomic developments and leverage opportunities created by the client's need to balance cost and digital imperatives, he pointed out.On whether some verticals are susceptible to larger macroeconomic concerns or seeing a slowdown in decision-making, he said there are no indications yet of any significant change in the long-term plans of clients, ""barring a handful of them in consumer-facing segments deferring spends"".Yet, it is early days to read a pattern in that, he added.""These are more like pockets of softness resulting from supply chain dependencies involving certain countries. We are continuing to engage with our customers and see where we can help them both on the cost-saving as well as the digital transformation mandates,"" he said.Last month, Mindtree reported over a 37 per cent rise in net profit for the June quarter and said it remained ""confident"" of growth momentum for the fiscal's first half and cautiously optimistic about the second half.The IT company's net profit stood at Rs 471.6 crore in the April-June quarter against Rs 343.4 crore a year ago. Revenues for the current fiscal's first quarter came in at Rs 3,121.1 crore, logging a growth of over 36 per cent year-on-year.Earlier this year, Mindtree and LTI (Larsen & Toubro Infotech), the two software units controlled by the Mumbai-based engineering conglomerate, announced a mega-merger to create an efficient and scaled-up IT services provider, exceeding USD 3.5 billion in total revenue.On the market opportunities that the proposed merger will yield, Chatterjee said: ""By unlocking scale benefits, a stronger portfolio of offerings across verticals, enhanced customer engagement, and streamlined delivery processes, the merged entity will be able to participate in larger deals, strengthen partnerships with ecosystem players and create a more distinctive employee value proposition"".

The infrastructure-to-IT services conglomerate has reduced the number of business verticals to seven from nine, kicking off a fresh round of restructuring. L&T had carved its diversified businesses into nine independent verticals 11 years ago. In the latest scheme of things, Subrahmanyan has brought the hydrocarbon and power businesses involved in EPC/turnkey solutions under the newly created energy vertical. Similarly, he has merged the heavy engineering and defence engineering businesses to form the hi-tech manufacturing segment. Subrahmanyan has also brought the e-commerce/digital platforms and data centres (earlier reported under the “others” segment) under the ambit of IT & technology services — the biggest money spinner for L&T. The IT and tech vertical already includes the company’s three listed subsidiaries — L&T Infotech, L&T Technology Services and Mindtree. The other four verticals are infrastructure (the biggest revenue contributor and the second biggest profit generator for L&T), financial services, development projects and others (which includes realty, manufacture & sale of rubber processing machinery & industrial valves, and military communication projects). L&T said it reorganised its segments effective April 1 of this year in alignment with its strategic plan to achieve a turnover of Rs 2.7 lakh crore by fiscal 2026 and scale up new businesses, which have high growth potential such as green EPC, data centres, electrolysers and digital platforms. The company, which employs nearly 2 lakh people in its IT units and 2.9 lakh labourers at any point of time at its construction sites, had a turnover of Rs 1.6 lakh crore in fiscal 2022. On Tuesday, L&T said its Q1FY23 revenue increased 22% to Rs 35,853 crore, while profit rose 45% to Rs 2,228 crore. “The regrouping would help L&T streamline and simplify its business segments,” said Sharekhan by BNP Paribas assistant VP Khadija Mantri. “Clubbing the inter-linked segments like hydropower & power or IT, e-commerce & digital platform businesses would help the company pursue opportunities in each of these segments in a more constructive manner.” L&T CFO Shankar Raman said that considering the transformation sweeping the energy sector, the company decided to create a new vertical that will house both the existing hydrocarbon and power businesses. “As the world embraces green energy, the green EPC projects the company will bid for will also be part of this new energy vertical.” Raman further said the company combined heavy engineering and defence engineering under hi-tech manufacturing to leverage on the design and manufacturing competencies when they are packed together. “Going forward, the manufacturing of green energy equipment like hydrogen electrolysers will also be brought under hi-tech manufacturing.” Raman also said that since the company anticipates the newly launched digital platforms and recently commissioned data centres businesses to generate revenues, which will be worth reporting, it has decided to bring the two under the IT and tech services vertical.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lt-cuts-biz-verticals-to-7-from-9-reduces-costs/articleshow/93146162.cms

This is being implemente","CHENNAI: To prevent accidents during tunnelling work, the Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) will conduct soil test below petrol pumps. This is being implemented for phase-2 of the project. The agency has identified three petrol pumps between proposed stations at Greenways Road and Adyar Junction, where twin tunnels will be built.Soil samples will be collected from around the fuel tanks built under these fuel outlets to check for stability, type, and pollution. The CMRL has awarded a contract to Larsen & Toubro to construct 12km-long twin-tunnels between Kellys at Purasawalkam and Taramani. Tunneling is likely to begin in November.  93124013“We plan to conduct soil tests under the fuel outlets for our own safety. Soil contaminated with fuel is a fire hazard during the tunnelling process. We have sought permission from BPCL and IOC to conduct the test,” an official said. “The fuel storage tanks are mostly stainless steel, so chances of leakage and soil contamination is less.” Also, the official added, the depth of these tanks is around three to four metres, while we will be tunnelling at 25 metres. The twin-tunnels will be at a depth of 15m to 22m between Greenways Road and Adyar junction metro stations. Officials at the construction site said the top layer of the soil is loose and there is rock below. When tunnel boring machines drill through rocky soil, it can cause friction and high temperatures. This may lead to fire accidents if the soil around the fuel storage tanks is contaminated with fuel. “If this is the case, the only solution is to replace it with fresh soil,” the official said. There is also a chance of soil collapsing, during tunnelling, if it’s not stable. This may require grouting to seal the gaps in the soil.On Monday, CMRL began soil tests in Adyar river. A drilling machine was installed on a pontoon or a flat platform, which was towed into the river by a fishing boat. “We will complete the soil investigation in Adyar river within a month,” an official said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cmrl-to-test-soil-below-fuel-stations/articleshow/93121752.cms

In February this year, the central government had notified the green hydrogen policy aimed at boosting production of green hydrogen and green ammonia to help the nation become a global hub for the environmentally friendly version of the element.For countries like India, with its ever-increasing oil and gas import bill, green hydrogen can also help provide crucial energy security by reducing the overall dependence on imported fossil fuels. While nearly all hydrogen produced in India today is grey, it is estimated that demand for hydrogen will be 12 million metric tonnes (MMT) by 2030 and around 40% of the element produced in the country (about 5 MMT) will be green, according to the draft National Hydrogen Mission guidelines. By 2050, nearly 80% of India’s hydrogen is projected to be green — produced by renewable electricity and electrolysis. Green hydrogen may become the most competitive route for hydrogen production by around 2030. This may be driven by potential cost declines in key production technologies and in clean energy technologies such as solar PV and wind turbines.Today, hydrogen is mainly used in the refining, steel and fertilizer sectors, which will be the focus of the JVs’ initial efforts. The country’s refining sector consumes approximately 2 MMT of grey hydrogen every year, with Indian Oil owning one of the largest shares of its refining output.To help decarbonise Indian industry, the green hydrogen policy provides for the waiver of inter-state transmission charges for a period of 25 years and a banking provision of up to 30 days, which will help reduce the cost of green hydrogen significantly. This will, therefore, push the replacement of grey hydrogen with green. The power ministry has also provided a single-window clearance portal for all clearances and open access on priority to green hydrogen projects.The JVs’ aim is to make green hydrogen a cost-effective energy carrier and a chemical feedstock for many sectors, said L&T MD S N Subrahmanyan.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lt-in-jvs-with-ioc-renew-for-green-hydrogen/articleshow/90650200.cms

The three companies have signed a binding term sheet to jointly develop green hydrogen projects, said a joint statement issued on Monday.  India, the world's third biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, plans to annually produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 as it seeks to meet its climate targets and become a production and export hub for the fuel. Indian companies, including the country's richest men Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, had previously announced plans to produce green hydrogen. State-run refiner and engineering and construction firm L&T and IOC also signed a binding term sheet to form a joint venture for manufacturing electrolysers, used for the production of green hydrogen. Green hydrogen has some of the best environmental credentials among cleaner-burning fuels and will replace carbon-emitting fuels used in the refinery to process crude oil into value-added products, such as petrol and diesel. An electrolyser splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable energy such as solar or wind for producing green hydrogen. Initially, the partnership will focus on green hydrogen projects at IOC's Mathura and Panipat refineries in northern India and evaluate building other green hydrogen projects in the country, said S.M. Vaidya, chairman of IOC. India also plans to provide federal financial support to set up electrolysers, as it wants to make the use of green hydrogen mandatory for refineries and fertiliser plants. The country's refining sector consumes about 2 million tonnes of grey hydrogen, produced through the use of gas instead of renewable energy, the statement said. ""The Indian Oil-L&T-ReNew JV will focus on developing Green Hydrogen projects in a time-bound manner to supply Green Hydrogen at an industrial scale,"" said S.N.

Upholding the spirit of ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in its recent ruling, the bench said the subcontractor can raise the invoice by charging integrated goods and service tax (IGST) from its office in Noida, Uttar Pradesh.IGST is levied in case of an interstate supply of goods and services. Rulings given by the AAR have a persuasive value. Tax practitioners say that if this ruling is adopted pan-India, it will go a long way in reducing costs — both the cost of registration and other administrative costs for business entities. 87728241On the downside, the AAR also held that in the absence of an office in Karnataka, the subcontractor cannot register as an input service distributor. Such registration was required to avail of the input tax credit against goods/services procured from suppliers at the site and distribute such credit onward to its Noida registration.In this case, GEW India, a private limited company that had a unit in Noida and a registered office in Pune (Maharashtra), obtained a work order from Larsen & Toubro to execute a works contract inside a naval base at Karwar in Karnataka. It entailed a composite supply of goods and services, such as installation of a steel structure for harbouring of ships. The steel was fabricated at its Noida unit and installation was on-site.GEW India explained that they are likely to provide accommodation in Karnataka for the resident engineer and others who may visit the work site, but will not have any office or administrative staff.

The company has quoted the lowest bid at Rs 3,142 crore, which is nearly 3.5% less than the government’s bid price of Rs 3,455 crore. The two other qualified bidders - Nagarjuna Construction Company (NCC) Ltd and Tata Projects Ltd - have quoted more than the government bid price.These three buildings, each with the capacity to accommodate about 6,000 government employees, will come up on the plot where IGNCA was earlier located. The central public works department (CPWD) has set a tight deadline of two-and-half years for completion of these buildings. The agency has also floated the tender for construction of a low-rise Vice-President Enclave close to North Block.While there was speculation thatTata Projects may quote the lowest considering it’s already constructing the New Parliament Building where it has deployed a huge number of men and machineries, the company’s bid price was Rs 3,546 crore, which is nearly 9% more than the government’s estimated project cost. The second lowest bidder NCC quoted Rs 3,318 crore, which is 1.9% more than the estimated cost.The successful bidder will be responsible for demolition of the structures at the current site, construction of the buildings and their maintenance for five years as well.As a part of the massive Central Vista Redevelopment plan, the government has proposed construction of a Common Central Secretariat of 10 buildings to accommodate all ministries and a conference facility along Rajpath.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/lt-wins-bid-to-construct-first-central-secretariat-bldgs/articleshow/87122192.cms

The grand temple complex as per blueprint will, however, be completed by 2024 by construction firms, Larsen & Toubro and Tata Consultancy, and could also overshoot the deadline, said highly placed sources in the Ram temple Trust.Talking to TOI, Trustee of Ram Mandir Trust Anil Mishra said, “The shifting of idols to the ‘garba griha’ will match the grandeur of August, 2020, ‘bhoomipujan’ with the likely participation of the President, prime minister, chief minister, Sangh brass and even Opposition leaders. This will mark the culmination of the centuries-old struggle for Ramjanmabhoomi and Ram Lalla will return to his place of birth after 500-year of exile. Construction firm Larsen and Toubro has a four-year contract to complete the temple, but it could take more time to make it an architectural marvel. Only the garba griha will be accessible to devotees and the entire campus will be developed by the end of 2025,"" said Mishra. The decision to throw open the mega temple project to pilgrims, followed marathon meetings of the temple trust presided over the construction committee chairman, Nripendra Mishra, this week.India’s best brains from top engineering institutions have finalised the blueprint of the temple foundation, which is scheduled for completion by October and work on boundary walls will begin by November.

The selection of the winning bid after submission and the inking of the actual contract is likely to take well over a year from now. Thereafter, it will take another seven years for the first new submarine to roll out, with the selected foreign firm providing transfer of technology (ToT) for vessel design, maintenance and setting up the production line in India. The other five submarines will subsequently roll out one per year, as per the proposed timeline.The submarines will be armed with a total of 18 land-attack cruise missiles and heavyweight torpedoes as well as equipped with fuel-cell based air-independent propulsion (AIP) for greater underwater endurance.The Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council on June 4 had cleared the decks for P-75I, which will be the first project under the “strategic partnership” policy promulgated in May 2017 to boost indigenous defence production.Incidentally, none of the major six to seven “Make in India” defence projects, collectively worth over Rs 3.5 lakh crore, have actually kicked off in the last seven years, as was first reported by TOI.P-75I was first granted 'acceptance of necessity’ way back in November 2007. As per approved plans, India should have at least 18 diesel-electric conventional submarines, six nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs) and four nuclear-powered submarines armed with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBNs).But India is currently grappling with a fast-depleting underwater combat arm at a time when Chinese warships and submarines are making regular forays to the IOR.The Navy has 12 very old diesel-electric submarines, with just half of them operational at any given time, and one more slated to retire this year. The force has also so far inducted three of the six French-origin Scorpene submarines being constructed under the over Rs 23,000 crore `Project-75’ underway at MDL.On the nuclear submarine front, India has a solitary SSBN in the shape of INS Arihant, which is armed with short-range ballistic missiles and became fully-operational in late-2018 to somewhat complete the `nuclear triad’ after the land-based Agni missiles and fighter jets. The second SSBN, INS Arighat, will be commissioned this year.Concurrently, another project to build six SSNs is pending with the Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod. Construction of three of the six SSNs, each weighing over 6,000-tonne and costing around Rs 15,000 crore, is likely to be cleared in the first go, as was first reported by TOI.China, incidentally, already has the world’s largest Navy with 350 warships, including 50 conventional and 10 nuclear submarines, and plans to reach a force-level of 420 by the end of this decade.Pakistan, too, is on course to get eight Yuan-class diesel electric submarines with AIP, four Type-054A multi-role stealth frigates and other naval platforms and weapons from China under deals worth over $7 billion.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-issues-tender-for-mega-rs-50000-crore-submarine-project/articleshow/84585664.cms

The HC bench of acting Chief Justice S V Gangapurwala and S G Chapalgaonkar said it appreciated the concern expressed by the petitioners for the benefit of the chawl residents but said reports annexed do not make out a case of construction being flawed. The HC also said the chawls have “outlived their life’’ and MHADA says they are “dilapidated’’. The HC said it is not a panning expert and can only step in if pointed out that construction is unlawful or not compliant with law, which has not been demonstrated.The HC however said that the State and all developers who have been awarded the contract “certainly are required to carry out the construction strictly in accordance with the provisions of Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR) 2034 and the rules and regulations operating and holding the field.’’Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy for Patel and Mahajan submitted that the PIL challenged the plans of the State government and Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) for redevelopment of over 15,000 tenements in the old BDD chawls in the heart of the island city.The residents of BDD chawls at present reside in 160 sq ft tenements with common toilets in ground plus three floored buildings, but have “adequate open space between buildings and occupants of all tenements get adequate light and air.’’The proposed redevelopment will ensure that tenants get 500 sq ft 2BHK apartments with two attached toilets, free of cost.Work order for N M Joshi marg redevelopment scheme work was issued in April 2017 to Shapoorji Palonji and SD Corporation.Chinoy citing pictorial depiction said tenement density would increase from 464 to 696.On March 23,2017 permission for construction of over 6.6 lakh sq meters at Naigaon was awarded to Larsen and Toubro Limited. It would have two buildings, 20 wings each of 19-23 floors and 3289 tenements, 55 shops, 93 stalls.Similarly worli project was in June 2018 awarded to TCC Construction Pvt Ltd, Capacit’e Infraprojects, Tata Projects Ltd and Citic Construction Company. It will have 87 buildings, 22 floors high with almost 8400 tenements each and 639 shops.Chinoy argued that the proposed rehabilitation buildings however “are closely grouped together and have severely limited access to light and air. In most cases wings nearly touch each other. In the guise of wings, even the mandatory minimum distance between two buildings is not being maintained. Such a close grouping will result in many rehabilitation units, particularly those at lower floors, being deprived of light and air. This would directly affect the health and well being of occupants resulting in increased incidences of TB. ‘’ He relied on a report by ‘Doctors For You.’But the proposed free sale building “has virtual unrestricted access to light and air.""Chinoy said profits from salable area is in “multiple of thousand crores.’’ “The enormous profit cannot be at the cost of human health and life,’’ he submitted.“It is false’’ to say that MHADA is going to make a profit of about Rs 15,000/- crore. “The light and ventilation of the rehabilitation building is as per the DCPR 2034,’’ said the State. The EIA report and GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment) report show that light and ventilation within the rehabilitation buildings is satisfactory and complying the norms “The tenement density will increase from existing 415 to 642 per hector. The FSI increases from existing 0.73 to 7.38.’’Senior counsel Ashutosh Kumbhakoni and Milind Sathe for State, SD Corporation respectively argued that the PIL was “not maintainable’’ as none of the beneficiaries have complained about the project or about the sample flat which is ready in 2018, nor has the validity of the law and rules governing the construction been challenged. There is also delay in filing of the petition they argued.Proposed redevelopment factors in 24 percent open space of total land area including mandatory open space on ground said the State and also “open space on the podium’’.The HC said petitioners’ reliance on report regarding TB cases in absence of air and light “may be in case of locality wherein the survey is carried out, however on the basis of the same it would not be possible to conclude that in the present case the construction activity undertaken is flawed.’’Sathe said petitioners themselves were the part of the report submitted by Mumbai Transformation Support Unit (MTSU), which recommended development of the BDD Chawls way back in August 2009. In August, 2016 Notification under Section 37(1)(AA)(a) of the MRTP Act was issued inviting objections and suggestions for amending DCR and introducing new DCR 33(9) (B)—for redevelopment of BDD chawls.The state and builders also argued that “Before initiation of the project, wide publicity was given to enable wide participation. The Petitioners, for the reasons best known to them, remained silent. On 05/01/2016 a joint meeting was convened of the Hon’ble Member of Parliament Mr. Arvind Sawant, Hon’ble Member of Assembly Mr. Kalidas Kolambkar, Mr. Sunil Shinde and Mr. Ajay Choudhari along with residents of BDD Chawls in Worli to understand demands and views of the residents of BDD Chawls. Thereafter on 20/01/2016 one more meeting was convened with Hon’ble Member of Parliament Mr. Rahul Shewale along with residents of BDD Chawls by VP and CEO, MHADA and his team of officers at Naigaon. It is only thereafter the proposal for redevelopment was submitted to the State Government taking into consideration the various suggestions.’’The HC said, “The EIA and GRIHA reports referred by the Respondents demonstrate that light and ventilation within the rehabilitation buildings was satisfactory and complying with the norms. The reports are prepared by the experts. The petitioners may be knowledgeable in that field however, it would be a case of word against word. This court would not substitute its view for the view of expert, more particularly, there is nothing on record to even remotely suggest that the plans sanctioned and the redevelopment being carried out is against the provisions of DCPR 2034 or against the provisions contained in Regulations of DCR 33 (9) (B) r/w Appendix III B.

It may also have cascading effect in the sense that slowly and gradually, the members of the public would come to know of the loss of control over criminals’ activities by police and a sense of fear will grip the whole society,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said.The judges requested additional government pleader Deepak Thakare to coordinate with the Maharashtra Information Technology Corporation and filed a detailed affidavit that included a statement regarding clearance of undisputed dues to L&T within 15 days.Slamming the L&T, the bench said its move not only interferes in performance of public duty by the authorities, but is also prima facie questionable in law, when the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and police submit that the company doesn’t own the entire hardware including CCTV cameras. “If this claim is true, a question would arise whether any maintenance agency like L&T has a right to stop access and if not, how such an act would be viewed by law?”Earlier, L&T’s project manager Ajay Ramteke informed that Rs 135 crore was outstanding against Maha-IT. “We haven’t stopped anything. The CCTVs are functioning and video recording is also being done. Only step that has been taken by the company is stopping their access to the police and other concerned parties,” he said.Before adjourning the hearing till July 16, the judges clarified that they aren’t aware of terms and conditions between the company and Maha-IT. “What we have become aware of the consequence of a particular act committed by L&T. The consequence has been submitted by amicus curiae and rightly so, is deleterious to the public interest. If no access is provided to police, the very purpose of installation of CCTV cameras would be defeated and it may also go against the spirit of the directions issued by HC regarding their installation.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hc-slams-govt-lt-asks-them-to-resolve-dispute/articleshow/84046173.cms

The project, to be completed at an outlay of Rs 49,621 crore, was launched by chairman of the atomic energy commission and secretary of the department of atomic energy Kamlesh Nilkanth Vyas through videoconference.KKNPP comprises six units of light water reactors with a capacity of 1,000 megawatt each. It is set up in technical cooperation with the Russian Federation. The project is being implemented in three phases with 2 X 1000 MW in each phase. Construction of units 3 and 4 is underway in the second phase and these units with a total capacity of 2,000 MW are nearly 50% complete.The ceremony was marked by pouring 6,200 cubic metres of concrete. Construction of units 5 and 6 will be completed in 66 and 75 months’, respectively. Construction of these two units will be executed by Larsen and Toubro (L&T) Limited that is engaged in the ongoing construction of units 3 and 4 that are almost 50% complete.Works to be carried out by L&T at Rs 2,305 crore include construction of the reactor, reactor auxiliary, turbine and diesel generator buildings and safety structures. While KKNPP was dependent on Russia for every component used in the first two reactors (units 1 and 2), it is learnt that around 36% of the components to be used in units 5 and 6 will be fabricated in India.On completion of these projects, the six units in KKNPP will generate 6,000 MW of clean electricity by the latter half of 2027, making it the largest power producing complex in India, Vyas said. The chairman expressed confidence that the reactors at KKNPP will place India among the frontrunners of nuclear energy producing countries globally.It will also make a significant contribution for the growth of Tamil Nadu, he added. He termed the construction of KKNPP reactors a stellar example of Indo–Russian strategic cooperation, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Both the countries are determined to complete the construction in the scheduled time, he said.Director general of the Russian State Nuclear Energy Corporation (ROSATOM) Dr Alexey Likhachev who virtually addressed from Moscow, said the third generation plus light water reactors built in KKNPP will have cutting-edge technologies to make the reactors the safest.Chairman and managing director of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited Satish Kumar Sharma said that units 1 and 2 have generated more than 57.4 billion units of carbon free green energy since they were commissioned. While global warming is a serious issue of concern world over, KKNPP plays a vital role in generating green energy. The contribution will be more when the plant generates 6,000 MW, he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/construction-of-new-units-5-and-6-at-kudankulam-power-plant-begins/articleshow/83966904.cms

Raghuvanshi said Saidpur project is for treatment of waste water and discharging it into the Ganga. “Even if the project was completed, people would have faced a similar situation. The sewage treatment plant (STP) networks being constructed by us hardly affect the existing sewerage networks. Then, how can we damage any pipeline,” he asked and said: “Residents will face waterlogging during monsoon in future as well because major parts of the city are in the low-lying areas, almost four metres lower than the Ashok Rajpath.”He said the company has replied to the show-cause notice issued by the state government on October 7. In the notice, the company was blamed for damaging the existing pipelines that connect to the sump houses, leading to overflowing of drains and prolonged waterlogging.Earlier on October 5, Patna mayor Sita Sahu had said several sewerage pipelines in the city were damaged during the ongoing works being done by L&T, leading to waterlogging in the city. She had also alleged that the L&T had not taken no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Patna Municipal Corporation for digging up roads for the STP.Raghuvanshi said the Saidpur STP works started only after getting nod from the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (BUIDCo). “BUIDCo must have taken the NOC from the PMC.

Whil,"LUCKNOW/MUMBAI: The leaders of India Inc came out with a number of proposals for investment in the state when they met CM Yogi Adityanath in Mumbai on Wednesday. While Larsen & Toubro evinced interest in the Rs 45,000-crore Ganga Expressway, the Tata Group unveiled its proposal to develop an electronic city and hotels at destinations of religious tourism, like Ayodhya and Prayagraj.“It was a successful day as industrialists made new commitments beyond the Investment summit 2018 and they were highly impressed with the chief minister’s commitment for industrial growth in the state and sectoral policies for this,"" said, additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal.‘New infra, no regional boundaries’We are not here to take away anything, Yogi said. “We will be creating world-class infrastructure and everyone needs to think high and provide better facilities,” CM Yogi told media persons in Mumbai.Uttar Pradesh was ready with facilities like security, environment conducive to business and no bias against anyone, he asserted.Ahead of chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s Mumbai visit, Thackeray said, while Maharashtra was not afraid of competition, nobody could forcibly take away business from the state. “We are not jealous of anyone’s progress, but it has to happen through fair competition,” said Shiv Sena president and former BJP ally.The chief minister said while Bollywood would continue to be in Mumbai, Uttar Pradesh will be setting up new infrastructure which would not be restricted to any region, but driven by industry demand.“We will seek recommendations from experts and set up a world class film city. I have spoken to several people from the industry on ways to develop this facility. We are not curtailing anyone’s development. Our aim should be the same, which is to ensure India becomes the world’s strongest economy. Each state is contributing in their own way and Film City is UP’s contribution,” the CM said.To draw investors, the government hammered out several sectoral policies and development picked up pace over three years, including the pandemic months, and the government has the intent to encourage investments, he said.The CM also clarified there was no migration from UP as his government provided opportunities, including 1.25 crore jobs during the Covid-induced lockdown.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-receives-proposals-for-ganga-e-way-electronic-city-/articleshow/79539975.cms

Servowatch Systems, the unit with 44 employees in the UK and India, had a revenue of Rs 50 crore in FY20 — 0.03% of L&T’s overall revenue. L&T said the Rs 89-crore consideration excludes taxes and any post-closing adjustments. Servowatch Systems, headquartered in Heybridge, UK, which offers solutions to navies, commercial vessels and yachts, is yet another divestiture of L&T as it seeks to sharpen its focus on its core competencies in construction and engineering. L&T recently sold its electrical automation unit to France’s Schneider for Rs 14,000 crore. L&T said it continuously evaluates its business portfolio and takes capital allocation decisions from a long-term perspective. The exit from Servowatch Systems is part of this portfolio-review process.“The divestment of Servowatch Systems is according to our stated goal of unlocking value within the existing business portfolio by divesting non-core units. L&T facilitated the business to develop an award-winning software platform for the latest generation of marine integrated platform management systems that are sold globally to many navies and commercial operators.

L&T has offered to execute the 237-km corridor at Rs 24,985 crore, emerging as lowest bidder for India's largest infra project. The government opened the financial bids on Monday.Railway board CEO and chairman V K Yadav had said last week that the work on this project will start from next month. Three groups placed technical bids for design and construction of the high-speed rail corridor, which will shrink the journey between the two cities to two hours. Bids were opened in September and L&T, Tata Projects-J Kumar Infra-HSR combine and Afcons-Ircon-JMC Projects qualified. The National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRC), the nodal agency implementing the 508-km corridor, will award the contract to L&T soon and has set a deadline of 48 months for the work. NHSRC officials say nearly 83% of land acquisition has been completed for the project. While most of the land needed in Gujarat has been acquired, about 23% has been obtained in Maharashtra. A major portion - 349 km of the total 508 km - falls in Gujarat. Delay in land acquisition in Maharashtra and the Covid pandemic have impacted schedules.

As head of the $21-billion construction conglomerate, the 60-year-old wants public spending to be increased on infrastructure, health and educational facilities, which will help in creating jobs and revive the economy…How far has your business returned to normal?As the country unlocks, means of transport open, supply chains resume and labour returns, operations are at about 90% at our project sites. All our manufacturing facilities have resumed and are gradually moving into high gear. We remain positive.What challenges has the new normal posed for you?For a project-based company like ours, the lockdown brought all physical activity to a complete halt. However, activities like planning, designing and engineering continued uninterrupted and, with our sites and facilities kept in readiness, we could restart operations as soon as the restrictions were relaxed.How to get new business amid the pandemic?Infrastructure development is imperative to revive economic activity, create employment and infuse more liquidity into the system. Projects funded by World Bank, JICA, Asian Development Bank, etc, should start moving faster. We are, therefore, optimistic that sectors like hospitals, power transmission & distribution, water, railways, roads, renewable energy and defence will show greater traction. What have been your learnings from the pandemic?These unprecedented times have clearly proven that cash is king. Our concerted effort is to conserve cash because sales and revenue will certainly follow. The other lesson for a project-based organisation like ours is everything is secondary to execution and our post-unlock focus has been to complete projects quickly, efficiently with safety and quality.Should the government go for a much bigger public investment programme to revive demand?For India to be a $5-trillion economy by 2024-25, all three growth engines — consumption, private investment, and government spending — need to fire. Currently, our infrastructure deficit is huge for a growing economy. Increasing public spending on roads, railways, infrastructure, healthcare and educational facilities will help create jobs and thereby revive the economy.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/increase-spending-on-infra-health/articleshow/78446042.cms

Hence, the company has sought to withdraw from the project,” said a state government official. An L&T spokesperson declined to comment.In 2017, L&T had bagged the Naigaum project in Dadar and the one at Worli a year later.The Naigaum project was estimated to cost Rs 2,400 crore and was to be completed within seven years in three phases. With no movement on the ground and escalating project cost, the construction firm thought it best to pull out, said the official.The then BJP-Shiv Sena government had promised 500-square-foot homes to each eligible tenant. The project announcement caused discord within several families residing in these tenements. There was opposition to the survey of tenants as family members who had moved out of these tiny 10-by-20-sq-ft tenements protested about their names not being included in the eligible list. Though Mhada had allotted them transit accommodation, residents were reluctant to move out as the government had failed to sign agreements assuring them of 500-sq-ft tenements each.L&T had constructed a sample flat at the site so residents would be encouraged to allow the redevelopment. In the first phase, 10 chawls comprising 800 tenements were to be redeveloped.The Naigaum plot is spread over 13.4 acres and the gross construction area was estimated at 6.7 lakh sq metres or 165 acres.Mhada had tentatively planned to build four sale buildings with 60 floors each at Naigaum. The authority had also proposed a 20-storey commercial structures, besides 20 buildings with 19 to 23 floors to house the existing tenants of the Naigaum chawls.The BDD chawls redevelopment was first proposed in 2009 but it has failed to take off. It meets the same fate as the ambitious Dharavi redevelopment project that has been hanging fire for nearly two decades.There are four clusters of BDD chawls in Mumbai, at Naigaum, N M Joshi Marg, Worli and Sewri. The Naigaum and Worli projects were bagged by L&T while the Tata group had bagged the N M Joshi project.Worli is the largest cluster. Sewri is the smallest. It is on Mumbai Port Trust land. Both the state government and Mhada had written to the Centre seeking permission to carry out redevelopment of the chawls.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-lt-bows-out-of-naigaums-bdd-chawls-redevelopment-project/articleshow/77756709.cms

No large player can execute a big project on its own strength. It requires the load-bearing capacity of several small and micro players who, in turn, depend on the financial prowess of the large company. Even if a small link in the chain gets strained, it can cost the entire ecosystem dearly.When the lockdown blues hit manufacturers hard, Rajkot-based Jyoti CNC Automation, a supplier of machine tools, decided to diversify into developing in-house ventilators and machine tools for defence sector. By doing so, Jyoti CNC Automation not only ensured its own survival, but also that of 90 MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) it works with. “We engaged with all our MSMEs to work with us on the new areas of machine supplies. During the lockdown, we knew there would be no demand for capital goods, and thus we decided to quickly diversify,” said Parakramsinh Jadeja, founder CEO of the Rs 800-crore Jyoti CNC Automation.Ahmedabad-based Mamata Group, an engineering and capital goods manufacturer of the order of Rs 2,000-crore, has a network of 400 regular vendors. The group helps its vendors by financing them fully and adjusting the same as advance against orders. Mahendra Patel, CMD of Mamata Group, said the firm has been running its operations at 90% for the last 12 days. “Our vendors have still not reached full capacity because some are located in red zone areas. However, we have not heard of any vendor going under. We stand by them, irrespective of the pandemic,” said Patel. 76680290For Kochi-based GR Tech, which executes plumbing contracts for Larsen & Toubro (L&T) on the Bengaluru international airport project, the latter helped with payments for labour, along with providing them with food and shelter during the Covid lockdown. “L&T has been extremely cooperative and empathetic on such matters,” said Pullat Ramachandran, the founder of GR Tech, adding, “If L&T had not been a benefactor, I would not have survived. MSMEs cannot survive more than a month or two on their own in times of a cash crunch.”L&T is one among GR Tech’s 27 current clients, but forms a significant part of the firm in value terms. However, not everyone has a large, benevolent benefactor to survive the current turmoil. There are many who have not received payments and are at the mercy of their clients.Here’s how the chain gets disrupted, leading to a cash crunch for some, and survival issues for others. When a corporate initiates a large project, it gets sub-contracted to a few tier-2 level contractors who, in turn, offload to several tier-3 localised small, micro and self-employed enterprises.“Most companies who offer contracts involving field activity or continuous supply set a minimum billing quantum, below which they do not accept invoices, thus leading to a delayed release of payments. The micro and small scale industry player is at the lowest tier of this chain. The strength of the chain lies in its weakest link. In a project site, bills don’t get easily certified. This is what leads to the collapse of the chain. When funds are released to large corporates, there’s no surety how the same would percolate to the smaller players,” said K E Raghunathan, CMD, Solkar Solar Industry, who is also the former national president of All India Manufacturers’ Organisation. “Most of the listed companies that belong to power, infra, auto, airlines, real estate, EPC contractors and telecom are not in good shape for the last two quarters. Who is the real loser? Micro and small enterprises,” said Raghunathan.Shrinath Bhandary, founder of Innospacer Engineering Technologies, which nets an average annual turnover of around Rs 7 crore, said the company has not been able to sustain its expenditure as clients are not releasing payments. Bhandary supplies to large infrastructure firms. “Large companies are also not in a great shape financially. Their projects have come to a standstill and they are in a cost-cutting mode too. Only priority sector jobs are going on currently and our business is down 70% since pre-lockdown. Even the loans offered as a relief measure are of no use because we already have large liabilities on our books,” said Bhandary.MSMEs have also made their displeasure felt on the financial package declared by the government some time ago. R Ramalingam, co-founder of Nutriplanet Foods, which is in the food & nutrition sector, has been trying for a term loan for working capital and purchase of raw material. “Our company has backward integration of chia seeds cultivation. It is used to manufacture nutrition bars. We have a good supply chain but we need cash flows to support it. We wanted to scale up our business, but there’s no money.

While IIFL Wealth has roped in Axis Capital to help with financing options for its bid, Blackstone is working with top law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas to strengthen its case before securities market regulator Sebi, said sources briefed on the matter.L&T Finance — which owns L&T Mutual Fund — is expecting about Rs 4,500 crore from the sale of the business. But Blackstone’s bid has come at around Rs 3,000 crore, which is higher than IIFL Wealth’s quote of Rs 2,650 crore. L&T Mutual Fund also has about Rs 500 crore in cash, which is expected to be added to the bid as well, said one of the sources mentioned earlier.What makes the transaction interesting is that Blackstone has bid to acquire over 60% stake in the company, said sources, given its top bid. “Sebi has not allowed private equity firms to acquire an Indian AMC as it insists on a five-year track record as an asset manager in the country,” said one of the sources mentioned earlier. The source added that PE firms can only own 39.9% stake. Blackstone is backing up its bid with a legal opinion that it has sufficient experience in asset management, given it globally manages $538 billion in assets across private equity, real estate, hedge funds and credit strategies, besides being present in India for over a decade with a market value of investments at $40 billion in the country.Several other PE firms like Carlyle and ChrysCapital have also evinced interest in the business, but the contours of their bids could not be ascertained till the time of going to the press. Spokespersons for L&T Finance and IIFL Wealth “declined to comment on speculation”, while Carlyle and Blackstone offered no comments. Sebi did not revert to TOI’s queries at the time of filing this article.L&T Mutual Fund is the 12th largest asset management company with an average Rs 71,000 crore, or around $9 billion, giving it about 2.7% share of the country’s $350-billion MF industry. L&T started an AMC 10 years ago, first with the acquisition of DBS Cholamandalam in 2009 and then Fidelity’s mutual fund business in 2012. The sale of the mutual fund business is being seen as critical for the engineering-to-software conglomerate L&T as it plans to commit up to Rs 10,000 crore in L&T Finance for a proposed rights issue later this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/blackstone-iifl-wealth-top-bidders-for-lts-mf-biz/articleshow/76499031.cms

Rescue operations continued till late in the night as several people were feared trapped under the debris. The second body was recovered late in the night. He was identified as Abdul Wahid.Officials of Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services (VFES) said a light-weight demolition machine would have hit a critical beam or column in the structure due to which the entire front portion of the building came down. During the initial rescue work, firemen rescued supervisor Kaiful Pathan and a person identified as Bhammar Singh Yadav. Pathan, who was in a critical condition as his both legs got chopped off, succumbed on way to SSG Hospital.Pathan, a 47-year-old resident of Navayard, and Yadav, 30, a native of Uttar Pradesh, were working on the first floor of the building. Sources said Yadav held on to a rope when the building started to collapse and later jumped due to which he received injuries.It is estimated that at least three persons were still feared trapped inside. “Fifteen people were working at the site and of whom, 10 were on the front side and had suffered minor injuries. Two others were removed from rubble and three are missing,” said a fire official. The VFES had pressed four firemen and four fire officers in the rescue operations with five excavating machines and five dumper trucks working beyond midnight to remove the debris and rescue the trapped persons. Before dark, personnel of National Disaster Response Force and the dog squad had also joined the rescue operations.“We have pressed our entire machinery here and the rescue work will go on without any break until all trapped persons are brought out safely,” said Vadodara municipal commissioner Nalin Upadhyay.While the fire department is claiming that there could be still three persons trapped inside, people working near the building said non-workers who used to loiter at the demolition site were also missing.As rescue operations were underway, senior police officers were deployed to manage traffic and crowd near the site.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/lts-old-building-collapses-two-dead-11-injured/articleshow/71668727.cms

Adani has no experience in manufacturing ships and submarines, and its only claim in favour of its bid was that it had experience in setting up and running power plants,” they said.According to Congress, the “empowered committee” rejected Adani’s bid and on examination of manufacturing facilities, financial records and other criteria, it short-listed two entities – government-owned Mazagaon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and Larsen and Toubro.“But the Central government and the defence ministry is now seeking to overrule the ‘empowered committee’ of Indian Navy by pressuring it to consider Adani defence. A decision is likely to be taken on Friday or Saturday,” Surjewala and Shergill claimed, calling it a case of “crony capitalism”.Targeting the government, Surjewala said, “The Submarine Project 75-I is under a cloud of suspicion owing to allegations of favouritism, crony capitalism, violations of the DPP-2016 and an alleged over-ruling of Indian Navy and its empowered committee by the Narendra Modi government.”“The government is flouting norms and the defence procurement procedure 2016 (DPP-2016) in awarding the contract to the Adani-HSL joint venture,” Surjewala said.Congress alleged Adani has also flouted project norms. It said there was no official joint venture till the final closure of Expression of Interest on September 11, 2019, and the companies announced formation of a JV only on September 28. It cited media reports on company’s announcement of JV to back its claim.“According to rules, the JV has to get the clearance from the Ministry of Defence. But it had not been taken at the time of submitting the EOI. The ‘credit rating’ has also been lowered to benefit the Adani JV. The norms say every entity bidding for a contract above Rs 1,000 crore should be categorised as ‘A’ but in this case it has been diluted to ‘BBB’,” Shergill alleged.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-govt-favouring-adani-group-for-rs-45000cr-sub-deal/articleshow/73284084.cms

So, directions had been given to NHAI to make the road motorable within 15 days on both sides of the flyover and also expedite the work of elevated road in a phased manner.""To redress and streamline the traffic in the district, the DC had suggested diverting the traffic from the construction site on other roads, so that the work is completed in the stipulated time frame.

According to Rashtriya Heddari Horata Samiti, which is leading the protest, as many as 2,000 to 5,000 people, who are affected by the road project work, undertaken by Larsen and Toubro, will take part in the protest.Fr Varghese K, president of Horata Samiti, addressing media persons on Wednesday, said that the association has submitted several memoranda to the deputy commissioner, people’s representatives and others, but have failed to get a proper answer. “With no one answering our concerns, nearly 23 organisations barring political parties have decided to organise this protest,” he said. “It’s a just first step. If the authorities do not respond adequately, the protest will be intensified and we may block the road connecting Bengaluru,” he said.According to the organisers, the protest will commence at 10am, which will be flagged off from Gandhi Maidan and culminate at Nelyadi town. Varghese explained that the project, spanning 30 months, was supposed to get over on September 22, 2019. “However, for reasons unknown, not even 10% of the work has been complete. When the project was announced, we were looking for better road. But after the work started, it made us feel dejected. Due to unscientific work, motorists, especially those who commute on bikes, are having a harrowing time day in and day out. Several road users have hospitalised, fractured their legs and hands after falling into potholes. We want the government to complete this work as soon as possible,” said Fr Varghese.Apart from it, since the road work is left half-complete, the entire road stretch witnesses traffic snarls.

The Adani Group does not currently own an active shipyard, which is why the bid has come as a surprise.Those familiar with the details told ET that the Gujarat-based group could float a special purpose vehicle (SPV) with state-owned Hindustan Shipyard (HSL), which has experience in submarine repairs and overhauls.HSL’s Standalone BidInterestingly, HSL has also put in a standalone bid.The Adani Group, which did not respond to queries, is now a contender for all three mega defence acquisition plans under the government’s strategic partnership model – for future fighter jets, naval helicopters and conventional submarines. 71089554 Others that submitted bids for the submarine programme are L&T, MDL and Reliance Naval.The contract, under which an Indian shipyard will be chosen to manufacture six conventional submarines in collaboration with a foreign partner, is in its initial stages. Over the next two months, the defence ministry will scrutinise the bids to shortlist qualified Indian contenders.The formal tender for the contract — after foreign partners from Russia, France, Germany, Spain and Sweden are selected as part of a parallel process — is expected by the end of the year. At the earliest, the submarine contract can be awarded to the winning contender after two years.The single biggest shipbuilding plan under the strategic partnership model is expected to see stateowned MDL as the frontrunner, given its experience in building the Shishumar class of submarines as well as the current production line for the Kalvari (Scorpene) class of boats.As reported by ET, the Adani Group has ambitious plans in defence, with its acquisition late last year of Bengaluru-based Alpha Design Technologies Pvt Ltd that has a strong order book and tieups with big Russian and Israeli companies.The acquisition has enabled Adani to get involved in the specialised defence and space business. Its product list now ranges from drones to helicopters and simulators. It’s also one of the major suppliers for the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme.The acquisition placed Adani Defence and Aerospace in the big league that includes the Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra, Reliance Defence and L&T, which are vying for large Make-in-India projects under the strategic partnership scheme.

Officials said Spain’s request could be considered positively as it is in Indian interest to broad base the selection as much as possible.Industry analysts have, however, raised doubts on whether the request could delay the selection process and if the Spanish Yard will be able to meet the technical parameters that have been discussed and shortlisted with Global Yards already.The Navy, which aims at a 200-ship fleet at the earliest to protect the Indian Ocean Region, is moving fast on shipbuilding projects and issued RFPs worth Rs 15,000 crore on Monday for 34 warships that are to be made in India.

The IT firm remained silent on how it plans to accommodate the three new L&T representatives.In March, L&T had said it will buy 20.32 per cent stake in Mindtree from VG Siddhartha and his coffee enterprise for over Rs 3,000 crore, marking India's first-ever hostile takeover bid in the IT space.Since then, L&T has steadily increased its holding in the Bengaluru-based tech firm to about 30 per cent.

L&T, which has emerged as the largest shareholder with a 30% stake, has sought board seats for its independent directors, sources said.L&T can only appoint independent directors as long it isn’t categorised as promoter. As the takeover stand-off escalates, L&T is also likely to seek promoter status soon after the open offer to public shareholders ends by this month end.L&T’s latest missive for board positions turns the heat on Mindtree founders who, along with largest institutional investor Nalanda Capital, have been asking for a better deal from the conglomerate following the hostile acquisition. The four founders together own 13% in Mindtree, while Nalanda holds about 11%. L&T’s push for board seats needs Mindtree shareholders’ approval and is expected to render the upcoming annual general meet (AGM) on July 16 a stormy affair, which could also determine the longevity of the founders at the two-decade-old, Bengaluru-headquartered company. An email sent to Mindtree didn’t elicit any reply.In March this year, L&T had bought 20% stake in Mindtree from Coffee Day founder VG Siddhartha. The company later increased its holding by another 10% through open market purchases. Its open offer to buy an additional 31% stake from Mindtree public shareholders, at Rs 980 per share, is under way. The Mumbai-based conglomerate’s plan is to have a maximum holding of 66% in Mindtree.The IT firm’s founders and Nalanda had earlier said that L&T’s existing offer undervalues the intrinsic M&A value of Mindtree, but they suffered a setback when the company’s independent directors opined that L&T’s offer “appears to be fair and reasonable”. L&T’s open offer for Mindtree shareholders opened on Monday and will close on June 28.L&T had rejected this better deal argument citing that the current open offer makes Mindtree the most expensive mid-market IT stock. The open offer price is at about four times premium to the average price-to-earnings multiple of 14.9 times of all mid-tier IT companies. Also in the derivatives market, prices of Mindtree’s June and July futures contracts are trading at a discount to the open offer price.L&T is also likely to oppose Mindtree’s hefty special dividend in the upcoming AGM as it feels that the company needs to preserve cash even though it would be the largest beneficiary of such a payout, sources said. Mindtree’s board had recommended a Rs 443-crore dividend bonanza, translating into Rs 27 per share, to celebrate the company’s twin achievements of exceeding $1 billion in terms of revenues and its 20th anniversary.

Prasad, a fo","MUMBAI: What is spurring Nalanda Capital founder and feted investment manager Pulak Chandan Prasad to fight a lonely battle with Larsen & Toubro?Prasad, a former McKinsey and Warburg Pincus head, who made a big killing in the early days of private equity investing in India, is rallying some Mindtree investors for a pyrrhic victory: Make L&T pay a better price for the mid-tier IT services company, after resisting the hostile takeover appears to be a lost cause.Prasad’s Nalanda, managing public market assets worth about $2 billion, is campaigning to keep its investment model intact, people familiar with the matter said. Nalanda builds big stakes of 8-10% in mid-cap companies — the largest institutional investor usually — with a tacit understanding to support the promoters and management in the long term.But L&T’s $1.6-billion hostile acquisition of Mindtree could potentially undermine Prasad’s investment thesis. Nalanda (with about 10.6%) became the only investor to publicly endorse the besieged management soon after the unsolicited bid was announced in March this year.Prasad, like the Mindtree founders, who together own around 13%, believes L&T’s offer price of Rs 980 apiece underplays the intrinsic M&A value of the Bengaluru-headquartered company. Nalanda has contacted some of the global investors who back funds (like Arohi and Amansa) that invest in Indian stocks, urging them to hold Mindtree for better value.Nalanda’s resolute work — first batting for the founders, and now fighting for a better bargain from L&T — comes even as the fund is sitting on handsome gains after building the Mindtree stake at an average price of Rs 260 apiece about 10 years ago.Prasad has remained stoic despite some of India Inc’s savvy dealmakers attempting a thaw in his frosty ties with one of the country’s largest conglomerates. Nobody needs to tell the veteran investor to put his money where his mouth is, said sources, who added, “Prasad, with a penchant for holding on to firm opinions, is working on insulating his thesis.”Emailed queries sent to Prasad on Thursday did not elicit a response till the time of going to the press. Nalanda wants to prove that its model of being a long-term bulwark investor — batting for the incumbent management, and with enough clout to steer the company’s interests — remains effective in the Indian mid-cap story. The standoff with L&T is possibly the first time Nalanda’s investment game and its unique ties with portfolio firms unfold in public glare.The low-profile Nalanda’s strident voice comes at a time when the investing community has been watching how its bet on Kirloskar Oil Engines — which recently made a surprising entry into the troubled NBFC sector — would plays out.Nalanda entered Kirloskar 11 years ago and has 9.6% in the company that manufactures and services diesel engines, agri pumps and generating sets. Shares of Kirloskar, also roiled by a family feud, have lost nearly 38% in the past nine months and more than halved after touching a lifetime high of Rs 406 two years ago.L&T, nearing 30% stake in Mindtree, has baulked at offering a higher price, and is scheduled to launch an open offer to Mindtree shareholders on June 17.

The 3.1-kilometre-long structure, connecting MIOT Hospital in Manapakkam with Mugalivakkam via Ramapuram, is aimed at decongesting traffic near DLF IT Park.88701679According to official data, every hour, more than 11,000 vehicles use the stretch, leading to traffic snarls, particularly during peak hours.To decongest the stretch, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), the nodal planning agency for the city, recommended construction of a grade separator along the stretch. The State Highways department approved the proposal in 2017-18, and a Detailed Project Report (DPR) was prepared.Meanwhile, during an inter-departmental meeting, the Highways authorities came to know about the CMRL’s proposal to construct an elevated line along the same stretch. As the proposed grade separator completely overlapped with the metro line, a government steering committee decided to integrate both the projects. Accordingly, the CMRL was assigned the task of finalising the designs and constructing the structures. Both the agencies agreed to share the construction cost.As per the latest design, the structures will come up at two levels – the grade separator on the first, and above that, the metro rail viaduct.A senior official said the highway will have four lanes to ease traffic flow.GR Ingulab, a resident-activist from Manappakam, said, “Ever since Chennai Trade Centre and DLR IT Park were established, the locality began to develop in leaps in bounds. Now, with the State government planning to establish a fintech city in the vicinity, the move to construct a grade separator will be more advantageous.”He, however, suggested the authorities provide alternate routes during the construction as the width of the road is bound to shrink during the period. “The stretch is already prone to accidents,” he said.The Highways official said Larsen and Toubro (L&T) has been awarded the contract for the construction of the grade separator and the metro rail viaduct. “It would take 36 months to complete the project. The plan is to open it for public use by November 2024,” he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/grade-separator-to-ease-snarls-on-mount-poonamallee-road/articleshow/88699228.cms

An electrical engineer, Joshipura’s leadership skills have helped him head the vertical well. L&T has another person from the pharmaceutical industry to oversee its corporate centre function. Even below the leadership level, there are examples of people who have been hired from a different industry because of their established competencies and skills.L&T senior VP (corporate HR) Yogi Sriram said a person with good experience in the automobile industry could also be a fit for the company’s valves business, if his/her skills are exemplary. L&T has been hiring candidates with requisite skills and competencies instead of strict adherence to their industry background. “We see generic as well as specific domain skills in the candidates. Such a hiring strategy augurs well for a conglomerate like ours, whose multiple businesses have grown organically and inorganically in segments as diverse as valves manufacturing to the construction of the tallest statues to the making of missiles,” said Sriram.For L&T, the nature of its businesses necessitates demonstration of agility and ability by its employees. “If we are hiring a project director for our hydrocarbon vertical to set up a naphtha cracker plant, then a chemical or mechanical engineer with specific domain skills could be an ideal candidate. But it is rare to get such a person with exact industry background to execute a complex process plant project. Power sector may be the nearest in this case as an adjacent industry. Hence, for this role, we may look for the requisite skills in a given candidate from the power sector,” said Sriram.69198513 The trend of hiring for skills, and not for the industry, has gained momentum across sectors. When Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) scouts for a maintenance person for the plant, the search is not restricted to auto alone. If the requirement is for talent in supply chain, it is quite likely that the auto major would source it from the e-commerce industry. M&M chief people officer Rajeshwar Tripathi said cross-hiring is the single most important change that has happened in the job market in recent years. “Talent is now coming from various sectors. When we used to do talent-mapping earlier, 80-90% of our talent would come from within the industry. That may not be exactly reverse today, but it has dramatically come down. We will see boundaries collapsing further. It is increasingly becoming a skill-based job market rather than industry-based. Organisations are hiring for skills and competencies without caring for which industry the talent comes from,” said Tripathi.At Avery Dennison, several such movements take place internally as well. The company moved the leader of supply chain management to a commercial role, thereby rotating people with fungible skills. Similarly, employees with analytical ability are moved to various roles in different functions, sometimes unrelated to their previous experience. Avery Dennison director HR (label & graphic materials - South Asia) Anushree Singh said, “We primarily hire for skills sets and then train them. Even our internal mobility is based on the same premise where we rotate talent with potential, learning agility and right skills and attitude.”In keeping with the trend, job-seeking candidates are broad-basing their knowledge to future-proof themselves from a particular skill getting redundant. “They share experiences, they showcase diverse projects they have done or led to prove their ability to expand their experience. They often self-educate or engage their skills too through formal training. The kind of job movements they do are also reflective of the same,” said Singh.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hunt-for-talent-goes-beyond-cos-core-biz/articleshow/69191465.cms

Markets will try for management guidance on both fresh orders and execution.L&T will announce the fourth quarter results of March quarter and full financial year of 2017-18, today.According to a Bloomberg poll, 11 analysts estimated a net income of Rs 29.9 billion for the quarter and 13 estimated consolidated revenue of Rs 410.7 billion.Last year in November, the company revised its order inflow growth forecast from the initial range of 12 to 14 percent for the financial year to somewhat flat, because of the weak inflow in the first two quarters. Analysts are hoping that this is likely to be beaten this time. By December-end, L&T’s nine-month order inflow for the financial year is Rs 1.03 trillion and the total order book at Rs 2.7 trillion.A local brokerage estimated that the company is likely to beat its revised order inflow guidance because it saw a large number of order win in the final two quarters of FY18. Major order wins in the past few months included two packages of the Mumbai Trans Harbour link, for Rs 86.5 billion.On Monday, in the management interaction, the market hopes to see guidance about order inflow growth for the present financial year and if there are further signs of improved execution for domestic orders. Another local analyst expects the company to forecast a 12 to 15 per cent in revenue and a 5 per cent to 10 per cent growth in order inflow for FY19.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lt-q4-results-2018-analysts-estimated-an-income-of-rs-29-9-billion-for-the-quarter/articleshow/64350721.cms

The submarines, designed by French firm Naval Group, are being built by the Mazagon Dock Limited in Mumbai.The project P-75 (I) will be a follow-on of Project 75.In January, the defence ministry cleared the long-delayed project.It will be the second project to be implemented under the strategic partnership model. The first project to get government's nod for implementation under the new model was acquisition of 111 utility helicopters for the Navy at a cost of over Rs 21,000 crore.Navy officials said construction of six submarines under Project 75 (I) will provide a major boost to the existing submarine design and manufacturing eco-system in India.

Mindtree had announced the share buyback programme on March 15 — a move that was widely interpreted as part of the defence plan rolled out by the company’s founders to stall an acquisition by L&T. But once L&T announced an open offer and V G Siddhartha, who had committed to sell his 20% stake in Mindtree to L&T, had given in writing that he would not support the buyback, the initiative had become untenable. A buyback in the midst of an open offer requires the support of at least 75% of shareholders.L&T’s open offer for Mindtree shareholders will start on May 14 and close on May 27. Through the open offer, L&T intends to acquire 31% of Mindtree shares for Rs 980 apiece, or Rs 5,030 crore. 68592859 Mindtree has formed an independent directors’ committee to provide “reasoned recommendation” to its shareholders on the open offer. The committee, which will be led by independent director Apurva Purohit, who is also president of publishing house Jagran Prakashan, will have to give its recommendation on or before May 10. A Mindtree release said the committee will be supported by independent legal and financial advisers to help with deliberations.The open offer price of Rs 980 is nearly 4% higher than Mindtree’s Tuesday closing price of Rs 944 on the NSE. It is unclear whether Mindtree’s founders, who have been resisting L&T’s unsolicited bid, have plans to make a counter offer. But if they do, they have time till April 16 for the same.The open offer follows L&T’s acquisition of a 20% stake in Mindtree for Rs 3,269 crore, or Rs 980 apiece, from Siddhartha. L&T also intends to buy another 15% of Mindtree at the same price from the market. L&T said that its open offer is not conditional upon any minimum level of acceptance. Its aim is to acquire a 66.3% stake in Mindtree as it looks to grow its services portfolio where margins are higher than its traditional business of engineering and construction. In a public statement, L&T said that its purpose of acquiring a controlling stake in Mindtree is aligned with its strategy to grow the revenue and profit of its asset-light services business portfolio, thereby increasing the consolidated return on equity.A 26% stake in Mindtree will allow the $18-billion giant to block special resolutions, while a 51% stake will give the conglomerate the right to exercise majority control and change the board structure of the IT services company. L&T, through its mutual fund arm, owns 1.08% in Mindtree but it said it doesn’t influence any investment decisions of its mutual fund schemes.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mindtrees-board-scraps-plan-to-buy-back-shares/articleshow/68588453.cms

The dam is owned, operated and maintained by Tamil Nadu government under a lease agreement between the erstwhile Travancore kingdom and Madras Presidency in 1886.The committee, notified by the home ministry recently, held its first meeting in New Delhi on Monday. “The meet discussed the preparation of an emergency action plan such as specifying role of agencies in providing specific inputs and inundation maps. The emergency plan is meant for situation like high floods in the dam,” said a senior ministry official. In its extensive report in 2012, the Supreme Court-appointed empowered committee to examine the century-old dam concluded that that it was hydrologically, structurally and seismically safe.The disaster management committee has representatives from the National Disaster Management Authority, ministries of environment and forest, power, agriculture and farmers’ welfare, department of telecommunication, besides representatives from Tamil Nadu and Kerala governments. Joint secretary of ministry of water resources is the convener of the committee, which will function under the National Executive Committee for disaster management.

With so much cash lying with the company and all the capacity build-up being done for our future requirements, this is the right time to reward shareholders,” company chairman A M Naik told ET Now.L&T will buy back stock from existing shareholders on a proportionate basis. This means that all categories of shareholders can participate in the share repurchase programme. Financial institutions, including SUUTI, hold the largest block of 23 per cent in L&T, followed by public shareholders with 22 per cent. The balance 55 per cent is held by other shareholders, including the L&T Employees Welfare Foundation. However, it will be interesting to see whether the foundation, which holds 12 per cent in the company, decides to participate in the share repurchase programme. The foundation, which was set up to prevent L&T being taken over by the Aditya Birla Group in 2003, has been acting as a fence against any unwarranted acquisitions. Naik in the past had told TOI that the structure ensures that it won’t be easy to buy the foundation’s large chunk of stake. If the foundation doesn’t participate in the share repurchase programme, it will tighten its grip over the $18-billion enterprise which has operations in over 30 countries. Besides the foundation, L&T’s directors hold 15.43 lakh shares of the company. As on March 31, 2018, Naik held 4.24 lakh shares of L&T.

With NITI Aayog sharing the latest sell-off list with the finance ministry, close to 50 companies have now been recommended for disinvestment via the strategic sale and leasing route, although the government’s track record has remained poor.Finance ministry officials said the proposals were being studied and a final decision will be taken by the cabinet committee on economic affairs, but defended the movement on strategic sale so far, arguing that the government was on course to complete some of the transactions, including Air India, where 76% equity is being offered for sale compared to the recommendation of 100%.Sources said NITI Aayog has recommended leasing out of Hotel Ashok — spread over 25 acres in the Capital’s diplomatic enclave — for 60 years to get the worn down property back to shape. While the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had sought to sell Hotel Ashok, the plan was resisted by the tourism ministry, apart from other problems. Even during the Narendra Modi regime, the sale of ITDC hotels has not been taken off as the government has opted to play safe. Last year, then tourism minister Mahesh Sharma had said the property was not on the disinvestment list, along with Samrat Hotel, as they were only a few metres away from the PM’s residence on what is now called Lok Kalyan Marg.Among the other PSUs under the fifth disinvestment plan, NITI Aayog has listed Bhel as one of the candidates, citing erosion in its market value over the last few years compared to private sector players such as Larsen & Toubro, that has aggressively grown and diversified. Based on Friday’s close, Bhel’s market cap was estimated at 27,535 crore, compared to nearly Rs 1.2 lakh crore for L&T. In May 2010, L&T’s market cap was around Rs 95,000 crore, while Bhel was at Rs 1.2 lakh crore.But unlike several other PSUs, the think tank has suggested that the government should reduce its stake in Bhel from 63% to 49% by offloading shares in the market, before diluting it further. A similar proposal made earlier had been trashed by the finance ministry.Sources said the panel headed by economist Rajiv Kumar has also recommended that government should begin selling assets in MTNL, once a top state-run company, which is now the third-biggest loss maker behind BSNL and Air India. The proposal is to hive off the telecom PSU’s towers into a separate company and sell off the entity. An outright stake sale has not been proposed, given the large real estate holdings. Surprisingly, Niti Aayog has not given any roadmap for BSNL, that reported loss of around Rs 4,800 crore in 2016-17.Other companies — from National Textiles Corporation to Hindustan Copper and Telecommunications Consultants (India) — may be put up for strategic sale with NITI Aayog recommending that government could exit most of these PSUs. While some of the companies, such as NTC, reported impressive profit in 2016-17, it was on the back of exceptional items or one-time gains.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-looking-at-stake-sales-in-11-more-public-sector-companies/articleshow/64325868.cms

The KLIP is being constructed at a cost of 80,000 crore to irrigate 37 lakh acres and to provide drinking water to thousands of villages in about seven districts. CWC teams are to visit the project site in three batches. The second batch will visit on June 5 and 6. A third batch is slated to come on June 19 and 20. CWC chairman S Masood Hussain along with some officers from water planning and project wings and director of irrigation planning (south) last month visited Kaleshwaram project and praised the project.

The over Rs 35,000-crore Bhushan Steel purchase is Tata Steel’s biggest merger and acquisition after the $13-billion Corus buy in 2007. The New Delhi branch of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also dismissed objections raised by creditor Larsen & Toubro and Bhushan Steel employees on Tata Steel’s bid. Besides, the tribunal has imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on Larsen & Toubro as well as on the employees of Bhushan Steel. The NCLT’s order now clears the way for the sale of the bankrupt asset. Larsen & Toubro had objected to the deal on the ground that Bhushan Steel owes it Rs 900 crore and that the engineering giant wanted it to be treated on a par with financial creditors. On the other hand, the employees of the bankrupt company had raised concerns over Tata Steel’s bid eligibility. Tata Steel, the country’s No. 2 private sector metal player, through its wholly owned subsidiary Bamnipal Steel, will acquire about 73% stake in Bhushan Steel, which has a 5.6 million-tonne capacity, for Rs 159 crore. Besides, it has offered Rs 35,200 crore to Bhushan Steel’s financial creditors to settle the company’s existing debt. The lenders will also hold a minority stake in Bhushan Steel through conversion of debt into equity.

The country’s second-largest private sector metal producer has paid Rs 35,200 crore to the creditors of Bhushan Steel for a 73% stake in the company, in what is seen as the conclusion of the first among a dozen high-profile cases that are being pushed for resolution under the new Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).The statement from Tata Steel came even as Bhushan Steel’s erstwhile owner Neeraj Singal has challenged the deal at the appellate tribunal and has sought a stay on the transfer of his 22% stake in the company. The matter is up for hearing on May 21. The completion of the acquisition puts the Singals out of the saddle from a company that had acquired the image of a perpetual loan defaulter that put up plants at a cost that was higher than the industry average. 64228713 The Tata-Bhushan deal drew immediate celebration from the government, which has forced banks and the RBI to use the new law that seeks time-bound resolution as part of a “clean-up drive” to rid Indian industry of loan defaulters. While cases ranging from Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel and Power to Binani Cement and Jaypee Associates are being fought across judicial forums, the government expects the successful resolution of Bhushan Steel to speed up a decision in other cases too.“Fifty-three lenders, domestic and international, recover Rs 35,200 crores under IBC — 76% of the outstanding bad debt. The whole process completed in 270 days from admission in NCLT. Creditors to also get upside from a 12% equity stake now in strong hands,” financial services secretary Rajeev Kumar tweeted. Banks had a loan exposure of Rs 56,079 crore to Bhushan Steel.Compared to the liquidation value of Rs 14,500 crore, the lenders had managed to realise a much higher value, said Piyush Goyal, who is officiating as finance minister while Arun Jaitley recuperates from a surgery. “For the first time, such a large loan resolution has been achieved through upfront payment received by banks through sale of a company,” he said. Goyal added, “This is a record step towards resolving the legacy of unprecedented amount of bad bank loans inherited by this government.” Goyal credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Jaitley for the insolvency resolution plan. He added that lower NPAs will make loans more affordable, especially for MSMEs.Besides the Rs 35,200 crore, Tata Steel will be paying Rs 1,200 crore to Bhushan Steel’s operational creditors like Larsen & Toubro over a year. Recently, Larsen & Toubro had objected to the deal on the ground that Bhushan Steel owes it Rs 900 crore and wanted it to be treated on a par with financial creditors. But the court had dismissed its petition.According to the arrangement between the financial creditors and Tata Steel, the former will hold 12% in Bhushan Steel after they convert a part of the debt into equity. Tata Steel has paid another Rs 100 crore to the financial creditors for “novation of remaining financial debt of Bhushan Steel”.Tata Steel, which has routed the acquisition through its wholly owned subsidiary Bamnipal Steel, will finance the transaction through a mix of debt (Rs 16,500 crore) and equity (Rs 18,700 crore). Bhushan Steel is Tata Steel’s biggest acquisition since Corus in 2007.While Electrosteel Steels was expected to be the first among the 12 bankruptcy cases to be resolved after potential buyer Vedanta got the tribunal’s nod, the unsuccessful bidder Renaissance Steel challenged Vedanta’s eligibility to take over the ailing company at the appellate tribunal and the case is listed for hearing on May 28.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/leg-up-for-ibc-as-tatas-buy-bhushan-steel/articleshow/64228714.cms

He said people in Old City have been eagerly waiting for the project. NVS Reddy told TOI that the Metro Rail project in Old City would be taken up as per the original alignment from Darushifa to Falaknuma. ""The government will soon finalise the width of the road as to whether it should be 80feet or 100feet wide for executing the project,"" he said. As many as 1,000 properties are most likely to be affected in the road widening required for executing the project. The state government is also working out a package for those who will be losing their property since people most affected will be small-time traders, Reddy said. ""The state government wants to construct Metro Rail with minimum road width so that the number of properties that need to be taken over are reduced further. Our plan is to protect the heritage and religious structures on the stretch. As per our plans, the Metro Rail will go over only four religious structures,"" NVS Reddy said. The Metro Rail project in Old City had been proposed as part of the Jubilee Bus Station (JBS) to Falaknuma (Corridor II) which is spread over 15km and has15 stations. It passes through 5.5km of Old City via Darulshifa, Puravana Haveli, Miralamandi, Moghalpura, Hari Bowli, Shalibanda and ends at Falaknuma. Though it was supposed to be taken up along with other areas, the JBS to Falaknuma corridors as of now ends at Mahatma Gandhi bus station (MGBS). Old City project work was delayed after Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (MIM) leaders and other groups opposed it on the grounds that the lignment would affect over 1,000 properties over just 5.5km. MIM leaders suggested an alternative alignment along the Musi river, High Court, City College, Hussaini Alam, Kalapathar and Bahadurpura. The project developer Larsen & Toubro (L&T), which had conducted a feasibility study on the advice of the state government, said the new alignment was not feasible as it would not only increase the project cost by 400 crore to 500 crore, but also increase the distance of the corridor by two kilometres. It also raised environmental issues as the alternative route would pass along the Musi river.

The smaller rocket that is being planned is expected to be ready for launch in three days.,"India’s space agency aims to create a consortium of companies to build and market a small rocket to launch low-weight satellites at lesser cost and within shorter durations, as it seeks to tap into burgeoning global demand for such services.  Led by Antrix Corp — the commercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organisation — the consortium will include engineering major Larsen & Toubro, Godrej Aerospace and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. The combine will help Isro build a small rocket capable of carrying 500 kilogram satellites into the lower earth orbit. “Antrix is working on a model to involve industry from the beginning.  Our aim is that one or two rockets will be launched by Isro, the industry should then make the rockets and launch satellites,” said K Sivan, chairman of Isro in an interview with ET. He said Isro has approached these companies and that “they are all interested”. 64026267   “The price of a satellite launch on this small rocket is expected to be less than one-fifth of the current launch costs,” Sivan added. The first development flight or launch of the rocket will be by 2019.  By involving companies such as L&T, Godrej and HAL, in the initial stages the space agency expects to improve the manufacturing process and bring down the cost of the rocket.  Typically, Isro takes around 45 days to assemble its workhorse the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). The smaller rocket, to be powered by a solid booster, is expected to be ready for launch in three days. It is being designed to place low-weight satellites in the low earth orbit of around 500 kilometres.  “We are looking at some disruptive technologies with this (rocket),” said Sivan.

Tata Steel has offered Rs 17,000 crore for the troubled metals company, which owes over Rs 40,000 crore to creditors.The creditors of Bhushan Power on Friday opened the bids after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) directed them to do so. Though Liberty’s bid is superior, Tata Steel may move the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to challenge the tribunal’s decision of directing the creditors to consider the UK-based company’s application despite submitting the bid after the deadline. The creditors will meet again in a few days to consider the eligibility of bidders.Besides an upfront payment of Rs 17,000 crore, Tata Steel has offered Rs 7,000 crore to meet Bhushan Power’s working capital needs. Liberty too has offered working capital commitments towards Bhushan Power, the details of which couldn’t be ascertained. Liberty had earlier stated that Bhushan Power, which makes auto grade steel, fits well with its commodity play. A controlling stake in Bhushan Power will give Liberty a foothold in the fast growing automotive steel market in India at a time of strong price upswing.The liquidation value and fair value of the Sanjay Singhal-promoted Bhushan Power is Rs 9,000 crore and Rs 24,000 crore. Singhal’s younger brother Neeraj Singhal-promoted Bhushan Steel has gone to Tata Steel, which emerged as the highest bidder for the bankrupt company, beating JSW Steel.Bhushan Power is the second insolvent asset for which Liberty has emerged as the top bidder after Amtek Auto. However, a final word on Liberty’s winning bid will be decided by NCLT-Chandigarh after resolving eligibility issues. Liberty, which has major plans in India, has also bid for ABG Shipyard, Adhunik Metaliks and Castek Technologies. For ABG Shipyard, Liberty is the lone bidder.Bhushan Power had an outstanding principal amount of Rs 42,000 crore with total claims of Rs 47,200 crore. Liberty’s offer is with nearly 60% haircut on the debt of the company and is in line with market expectations. Punjab National Bank leads the consortium of lenders to the company. However, SBI is understood to have the largest exposure. Although Tata Steel’s resolution plan for Bhushan Steel has been accepted by the committee of creditors, Larsen & Toubro has filed an objection to the resolution plan on the grounds that Bhushan Steel owes it Rs 900 crore. If the two Bhushan proposals go through, it will help to bring down the non-performing assets of Indian banks substantially.

As soon as the special court in Jodhpur Central Jail sentenced Asaram to life in prison — until death — Darshan Kumar, one of the caretakers, burst into tears. “Thousands of his devotees thronged the ashram. However, the footfall started thinning after August 2013,” Kumar, who hails from Maharashtra and has been working here for years, told TOI.  Situated in Rudrapur village, about 2km from Shahjahanpur city, the ashram is well-known to locals as it is was set up on land donated by the rape survivor’s father. Asaram followers from Shahjahanpur, Lakhimpur Kheri and Farukkhabad districts had polled in to construct the ashram building. “People in large numbers use to gather here, especially during Baisakhi, Diwali and other festivals. Large crowds were also witnessed during the satsangs organized by his followers from Gujarat and Rajasthan,” said Kumar. However, things started changing in 2013 after the godman was booked for the rape of a 16-year-old girl at his ashram in Jodhpur. “At one point of time, the entire village had turned into Asaram’s followers after the girl’s father began organizing satsangs here. Slowly, people started staying away and after Kripal Singh, a witness in the case, was murdered, villagers completely stopped coming,” the caretaker said, adding that the ashram was even attacked and its property was damaged in 2015.  Ghanshyam, a former caretaker of the ashram for over four years, left the premises in September 2017, leaving behind Kumar and Gyanendra Singh to manage the property. “We were hoping that Bapuji will be acquitted by the court as he is innocent. Our faith in him hasn’t shaken and we will wait until he is pronounced not-guilty,” said Singh.  In Agra, Asaram’s ashram at Sikandra wore a deserted look. According to reports, the godman’s followers had been holding prayers for a favourable verdict, but no one could be seen at the premises after the court announced its order.  Meanwhile, in Dehradun, an uneasy calm could be witnessed at Asaram’s ashram. An inmate, Tripta Sharma, who has been the godman’s follower for more than 20 years, was still convinced that he had done no wrong and that he would be acquitted by the high court. “The verdict has hurt lakhs of his followers.

Either way, the process is likely to delay commencement of the project by at least four months. Moreover, the higher quotes by the bidders have raised questions about the source of funds and financial implications pertaining to the project. Initially, the deadline set for Metro Phase 2 was 2020 and later it got revised to 2022.62868675 Four infrastructure firms have emerged as the lowest bidders for the underground network. But the total value (if all four bids are added) is about 65% to 75% higher than the BMRCL’s estimate of Rs 5,047 crore. Larsen & Toubro, Gulermak, Afcons Infrastructure and Italian-Thai Development have offered a package each on the 14km (approximate) Dairy Circle–Nagawara underground section of Metro’s 21-km line-4 (Reach 6) of the 72-km project. Bids for this stretch’s civil works, called in June 2017, were opened on Friday.  “The lowest bids received by BMRCL amount to Rs 8,553 crore. The amount which will be “lost” if the lowest bids are accepted works out to Rs 3,505 crore. The momentum of “losing” thousands of crores is picking up. Bengalureans were told BMRCL will go to any length to “save” money. Who will answer for the thousands of crores which will be lost now?” Raj Kumar Duggar, a Vasant Nagar resident, posted on Facebook.When TOI asked about the next step, BMRCL MD Mahendra Jain said: “Too early to say. We will plan and strategize.” “ The process of awarding the project to the bidder is not complete. The bids will now undergo scrutiny by the evaluation committee. Only after that the letter of acceptance will be issued to companies, followed by signing of the agreement. If the bidders, who have quoted the lowest rates get disqualified or if the BMRCL decides not to go with the quotations, they may float tenders again or break the existing project into different packages,” said a BMRCL official.

Through monetization, L&T wants to lease the land allotted to them by the state government to third parties for a sum after which the latter will develop them as business models.According to sources, on the presumption that L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Limited (LTMRHL), a special purpose vehicle to build and operate the metro, might suffer losses for five to six years after the launch of the project, the TS government has asked the concessionaire to submit a proposal for permitting intermediaries and co developers to support the project financially through monetization. However, even as L&T wanted to submit a proposal to that effect at a recent meeting, HMRL opposed it and pointed out the risks involved for the government in granting permission for monetization.Following the opposition by HMRL, chief secretary S P Singh has directed L&T to submit a proposal “duly bringing out as to how the interests of the government will be protected in the proposed monetisation.“ In its argument opposing the monetization, HMRL said: “The financial model envisages that 45% of revenues come from property development. If the concessionaire fails or abandons the project at any time, the government will have to run the metro rail and take over the liabilities of the concessionaire as per the provisions of the Concession Agreement.And if the properties are monetised by the concessionaire in advance, there will be no revenue for the state.“HMRL said provisions of the Concession Agreement do not provide permission for bringing in intermediaries and co-developers through advance monetization of TOD rights.L&T insisted, “The monetization mechanism will be worked out in such a way that the government's interests will be protected and, that without monetization, it will be difficult for the concessionaire to execute the project beyond a point due to cost over runs.“Even as this issue remains to be resolved, L&T has asked the TRS government to support its proposal for seeking additional grant from the Union government in view of the project cost increasing significantly . The project developer also sought permission to commence operations at Panjagutta and Hi-Tec City Malls (TOD) while the Concession Agreement allows leasing of the TOD only after commencement of the rail system. L&T has already built three malls and one more is in the making. All of them are expected to generate revenue once they become operational. The sources said, in response to L&T's request, the TRS government has asked it to send a proposal to government on the revenues to be generated from TOD prior to commencement of operations and said it will take a view on it after that.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyderabad-metro-rail-limited-larsen-toubro-clash-over-metro-malls/articleshow/60835055.cms

LT,2017-12-26T06:26:00+05:30,Namrata Singh,Economic slowdown restricts CEOs’ entry into million-dollar club,India Business News: MUMBAI: A subdued economy has not only hit the man on the street but also top execs in the corner office by slowing their entry into the million-dolla.,"MUMBAI: A subdued economy has not only hit the man on the street but also top execs in the corner office by slowing their entry into the million-dollar salary club.According to a study by EMA Partners, commissioned byTOI, only one executive was added to their list of CEOs who took home a million dollars (about Rs 6.5 crore) in compensation in 2016-17. Global executive search firm EMA Partners tracks the earnings of CEOs/ CXOs across top 200 listed companies in India for TOI. Over the last few years, there has been a steady rise in the membership of the elite club — from 94 in 2013-14 to 100 in FY15 to 119 in FY16. After growing at 6% and 19% respectively in the previous two fiscals, the pace has slowed in 2016-17 with the club expanding by just one more member to 120. The study does not include stock options and, thus, several CEOs who took home a fatter package on account of such perquisites do not figure in the list.The total compensation of the elite club has come down from Rs 2,083 crore in 2016 to Rs 1,979 crore in 2017. It stood at Rs 1,528 crore in 2015. The average compensation (total sum of compensation divided by the number of executives in the million-dollar club), too, has fallen from Rs 17.5 crore in 2016 to Rs 16.5 crore in 2017. In 2015, the average compensation was around Rs 15 crore. According to the study, the average compensation is lower in 2017 as only 51 executives got over 10% increase in salary against 72 in 2015-2016.What are the reasons behind the muted membership rise in the elite club when the global growth outlook has improved and the India story remains intact? “The rise in compensation depends on several factors, including business growth, availability and competition for talent, internal leadership pipeline and, above all, the business impact. The core/manufacturing sector has gone through a bit of stress during the past year and this reflects in the overall muted compensation trend in that period,” said K Sudarshan, regional managing partner —Asia, EMA Partners. The overall CEO compensation is also a function of the profitability of the enterprise and the commissions/incentives paid out in lieu, he added. Sudarshan, however, sees this as a temporary phenomenon as growth and profitability numbers are kicking in this fiscal and he expects compensation to also keep pace with it.Moreover, it’s a myth to believe that CEO compensation necessarily goes up every year, says Santrupt Misra, CEO, Carbon Black Business and director, group HR, Aditya Birla Group. “Some years may see a strong rise, while others may witness muted growth. The growth of the economy too can be a factor in the rate of compensation growth. Let’s also not forget that boards and shareholders nowadays keep a close watch on the CEO compensation, making it more aligned to the performance of the company.”The study also establishes the trend of professional CEOs outnumbering promoter CEOs. Among the 120 CEOs in the million-dollar salary club, 61 are professional CEOs and 59 are promoters. Sudarshan said, “As we have seen, professional CEOs will continue to become more prominent and the tribe is set to expand as Indian businesses grow in scale and complexity.”Leading the list of million-dollar salary CEOs, once again, are the Marans of Sun Group — Kalanithi Maran and Kavery Kalanithi — who drew a compensation of about Rs 78 crore each in 2016-17 (see graph). Former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, who catapulted into the top 10 of the club last year with a compensation of Rs 49 crore, is down to rank 54 this year with a Rs 12-crore package. Among the professional CEOs who marked their entry into the club this time are Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors (around Rs 16 crore), Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle India (Rs 9 crore) and Chanda Kochhar, MD & CEO, ICICI Bank (about Rs 8 crore). Among those who exited the club are Gautam Singhania, CMD, Raymond (approximately Rs 6 crore) and Ajit Gulabchand, CMD, HCC (around Rs 4 crore). T K Kurien, who retired as executive vice-chairman of Wipro on January 31, 2017, had a total compensation of Rs 9.7 crore from April 1, 2016 till the time he superannuated. However, he did not make it to the list this year because his compensation includes a stock option component of around Rs 5 crore.AM Naik, who retired as executive chairman of Larsen & Toubro in September 2017, on the other hand, took home a retirement benefit component of Rs 38 crore (which includes encashment of accumulated past service leave of Rs 32 crore) which boosted his total income to about Rs 60 crore (excluding stock option perquisites), aiding his inclusion in the million-dollar club this year. Naik’s basic salary was just around Rs 3 crore in fiscal year 2017.Most founders earn more from equity appreciation than salary and requisite commissions. According to the study, Mukesh Ambani’s compensation this year remained the same as that in 2015-16 at Rs 15 crore, while Anand Mahindra’s package rose to around Rs 8 crore from Rs 7 crore. Kumar Mangalam Birla figured in the top 20 with a compensation of Rs 38 crore, which is down from Rs 43 crore last year.Average CEO salary in India is said to be lower than comparable companies in the West in absolute terms. “Many Indians are succeeding as CEOs of global companies, giving credence to country’s talent and ability. The question to ask would be whether Indian CEOs leading global businesses will be compensated on a par with colleagues in the West and at what stage of economic growth are we likely to see it happening,” Misra said. He believes compensation issues, particularly the executive & CEO package, are often oversimplified in popular discourse.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/economic-slowdown-restricts-ceos-entry-into-million-dollar-club/articleshow/62246470.cms

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the first phase of the 72-km project tomorrow, touted to be the world's largest such project on public-private partnership in the sector. L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Ltd, the developer of the project, has sought ""additional financial support"" from the Telangana government to cover the cost overruns due to delays in projects, leading to extension of time, the sources said. The cost overruns work out to over Rs 3,000 crore, the sources added. ""The company is also learnt to have sought extension of period by two years,"" an industry source said, adding that any decision is likely after consultation with the Centre as the urban development ministry is also part of the project. The project, which was originally slated to go on stream in July this year, was extended till November 2018 and Telangana minister K T Rama Rao recently confirmed it. Conceived in 2009, the 72-km project has overcome many hurdles such as default by first concessionaire Maytas Infra- led consortium and now, the present developer and subsequent developments, crucial land acquisition by the state government and logjam for sometime over route alignment, among others. L&T, however, did not respond to the queries in this regard. A senior state government official said, ""There would be cost escalations as the project got delayed."" He, however, said the government issues will be settled in accordance with the concession agreement. The project has got stuck in delays as L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) had over three years ago written a letter to the Telangana government offering to quit the Rs 16,000-plus crore project as the last resort if ""issues"" were not resolved. When asked if L&T offered to hand over the project to the government, the then chief executive and MD V B Gadgil had replied: ""In case, the issues do not get settled."" ""That (to quit) is one solution we have told them in case both of us are not able to resolve,"" he had said after a meeting with the chief minister and the chief secretary in 2014. L&T has also written a letter to the state government on the matter.  L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) is an L&T subsidiary, which is developing the metro at a total cost is Rs 16,375 crore -- Rs 14,132 crore for the metro rail system and another Rs 2,243 crore for the real estate development. According to available data, the concession agreement for the project totalling 72 km metro lines with 66 stations was executed in September 2010 while financial closure was achieved in April 2011. The first phase comprises 30 kms and 24 stations while the second phase of the remaining corridor barring a 6-km stretch -- near Charminar -- is expected to be commissioned by November 2018.

Speaking at the launch of his biography titled 'The Nationalist', authored by columnist Minhaz Merchant, here last evening, Anil M Naik also reminisced about the historic three-phased demerger of Larsen & Toubro (L&T), which led to its emergence as a top player in engineering, manufacturing and projects segments. Significantly, both Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries and Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of Aditya Birla Group, were present on the occasion when Naik nostalgically recollected how he battled against the two powerful Indian conglomerates. In 1987, the late Dhirubhai Ambani had managed to wrest significant holding in the cash-rich L&T and then launched a hostile takeover bid in 1989. However, political and other developments ensured Reliance remained a passive shareholder. Naik, who joined L&T as a junior engineer in the mid- 1960s and went on to become its Chairman, recalled in the book the events leading up to Reliance's stake sale. According to the book, it was in November 2001, when Naik, then CEO and Managing Director, who was in Chicago, got a call from Mohan Karnani, then president of L&T cement business saying 'apna maalik badal gaya hai' (our owner has changed) and that the Birlas had bought complete stake of Reliance Industries in L&T in an all-cash deal. ""Within few minutes got another call from Anil Ambani, the then managing director of RIL, saying 'Anilbhai (Naik) you never wanted us. So we are going. We have sold the entire shareholding of Reliance in L&T to Kumar Mangalam Birla',"" the book quotes Naik as saying. Naik recalled that he got another call, this time from Birla, who said ""you didn't come to us Naikji. So we have come to you."" ""In the end we kept L&T independent. We ringfenced it from future takeover attempts by setting up the L&T employees welfare foundation that eventually bought Birlas stake. And the Birlas got our demerged cement business that added to their cement production capacity. ""It relieved us of a non-core asset-heavy business, making us an AAA rated company by drastically cutting out debt equity ratio. It was a win-win for all,"" Naik said in the book. ""What seemingly started as a conflict situation with Grasim ended in a win-win solution for both the companies. Grasim became the largest and top quality cement producer and L&T emerged as one of the best engineering, manufacturing and projects company in this part of the world. ""A great moment of satisfaction came when, at the end, Mr Birla extended his hand to me and said, 'history should never, never forget you. You know what you have achieved: employee ownership of the company',"" Naik remembered. Since the time Naik took over as the chief executive officer in 1999, the group revenues between 1999 and 2017 have grown from Rs 5,000 crore to nearly Rs 1,25,000 crore on a like-to-like basis. During the same period, market capitalisation rose from around Rs 2,000 crore to over Rs 1,70,000 crore. Describing L&T as a temple, the 75-year-old corporate honcho and Padma Bhushan awardee says in the book, ""I am devoted, committed and married to L&T. Do you know that in my first 21 years in the company, I didn't take a single day off? My parents were considerate, too. My father passed away on a Sunday, a holiday, and two years later, my mother died on August 15. Even they didn't want their son to take leave!"" ""For 53 years I've worked for 15 to 16 hours a day, sometimes even on Sundays and holidays,"" he said. He also admitted that he should have spent more time with his wife and two children, who now live in the US.

""My association with Naik goes back to 35 years, when I saw him as a young engineer and that was in 1983-84. At that time, he was the original Make-in-India man,"" Ambani said at the launch of Naik's biography titled 'The Nationalist' here this evening. The book, authored by Minhaz Merchant, details how Naik, in his 53 years at the nation's largest engineering company, has travelled the long and arduous route to reach great heights. ""During that period (1983-84), I had returned from the US and we wanted to build capacities. I was quite idealistic and wanted to build a world-class facility. So I thought we would have to import from Germany and Japan. But Naik told me the he would do it. That is the vision I saw in him in the 80s,"" Ambani said. He further said the basic parameter in the 35 years of association was that we will make in India, but without compromising on the quality. ""I told him that we want quality to be better than anyone else and you have the Reliance business,"" Ambani said. ""Being a shop-floor man, Naik could understand the micro details and he was very ambitious. His curiosity and ambition is such that whenever, during our talks, I told him that foreign firms have got certain technology, he would strive to develop a much better version of it. When I told him about the CAD (computer-aided design) system, within three months, L&T had developed it. ""Recently, I spoke to him about artificial intelligence and I am sure that within a few months you will tell me that your intelligence is better than the whole world,"" Ambani said. He further said that the architecture of partnership between L&T and Reliance is cost-plus and a win-win. Talking about the opportunity the country has going forward, Ambani said, ""In the next 10 years, India will go from a USD 2.26 trillion economy to USD 7 trillion. This will be the biggest opportunity in the world and I am sure that engineers like you and me and entrepreneurs will really take a lesson from your book and life."" Speaking at the event, Naik said, ""In 1965, destiny brought me to L&T. I entered the gates of Larsen & Toubro at Powai with a dream in my heart. I consider myself fortunate that I could join the company I had dreamt about, and eventually attain a position, from where I could reshape that very dream."" Naik said between 1999 and 2017, the group's revenue has grown from Rs 5,000 crore to nearly Rs 1,25,000 crore on a like-to-like basis. ""During the same period, market capitalisation rose from around Rs 2,000 crore to over Rs 1,70,000 crore. ""We have actively participated in national missions in nuclear power generation, aerospace, infrastructure and hydrocarbon. We are paving the way for a new future in defence, digital and smart world and getting prepared for a fast changing technology-driven environment,"" Naik said.

The Commission, whose report was tabled in the Legislative Assembly today, looked into the allegations which mostly pertained to allotment of land for major industrial and infrastructure projects including nine cases related to Tata Nano plant, Adani Group's Mundra Port and SEZ, and Larsen and Toubro. ""Public interest, particularly for the state of Gujarat, was a paramount consideration for inviting Tata to establish Nano project and automotive hub in the state of Gujarat. The said policy decision was taken in conformity with the central government policy of establishing automotive industry,"" the two-part report stated. The report ran into more than 5,500 pages and has 22 volumes. Congress leaders, including Shaktisinh Gohil and Arjun Modhvaida, had submitted a memorandum to the then President in July 2011, listing 17 allegations of corruption against Modi who was at the helm in Gujarat. Modi had set up the panel under retired Supreme Court judge M B Shah in August 2011 to enquire into 15 out of 17 allegations, as remaining two were sub-judice. The report was tabled in the House in the wake of repeated demands made by the Congress during the ongoing Budget session. The Commission submitted to the government its first report in September 2012 on nine allegations related to the land allotments to various companies including Tata Nano in Sanand, Adani SEZ in Mundra and Larsan and Toubro in Hazira. The second report related to another six allegations was submitted to the government in November 2013. The panel has probed thirteen out of fifteen allegations, stating that ""the subject matter of rest two is either in high court or supreme court"". As per the Assembly Secretariat, the state government provided only one copy of the report, which was kept in its library for everybody to view. MLAs were not provided with the copy of reports. The commission has given separate reports on all the allegations, which form part of the overall report. Broadly, in all nine cases of land allotment, the allegations of corruption cannot be substantiated as land was alloted as per the industrial development policies of the central and state governments, the report stated. The Congress leaders had alleged that a concession of Rs 33,000 crore was given to Tata Nano plant for bringing it to Sanand from West Bengal where it was stuck. As per the panel, Tata Nano project was not the only one to be provided with concession on allotment of land and other benefits in Gujarat and in other states. ""There is no substance in the allegations that Tata Motors Limited was favoured in anyway as contended,"" it said. The panel also found no substance in allegations against the Modi government's decision to allocate lands to Adani Group for Mundra Port and SEZ.

In a chamber meeting held at the NGT premises, a bench headed by Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar rapped the authorities saying that except for shifting blame, the stakeholders, including the city government, had no reasons to offer in support of their ""inaction and non-cooperation"" for completing the project.  It also asked them to explain why the amount earmarked by the Delhi government and the DJB for Yamuna rejuvenation should not be attached for violation of the NGT orders.  The Phase-I of the clean Yamuna project aims to lower the pollution levels in the Najafgarh and Delhi Gate drains, while Phase-II deals with Shahdara, Barapullah and other drains.  The green panel said it was a matter of great regret that the judgement of the tribunal in relation to cleaning and rejuvenation of river Yamuna passed on January 13, 2015 have not been complied with by the various stakeholders till date.  During the meeting which went for over an hour, DJB CEO Keshav Chandra told the tribunal that work on Phase-1 of the project was stopped as the AAP government had initiated enquiry against him for alleged financial irregularities over the setting up of sewage treatment plants.  The NGT took exception over this submission and asked why the DJB CEO did not approach the NGT, instead of stopping the work.  It directed DJB to file a detailed reply in ten days and posted the matter for further hearing on November 6.  Advocate Kush Sharma, appearing for Delhi Development Authority (DDA), said they have complied with the NGT orders and were releasing the money as demanded by the DJB.  He said even the NGT has appreciated the steps taken by the DDA for Yamuna cleaning.  The meeting was attended by the chief secretary of Delhi government, DDA vice chairman Udai Pratap Singh, DJB CEO, representative of the project proponent Larsen & Toubro and officials from National Mission for Clean Ganga.  The tribunal had earlier directed the Delhi government and DJB to submit a status report on the progress of the work in the first phase of cleaning the river Yamuna.  It had then directed Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh to file a complete report of the stretch of the Yamuna falling beyond the national capital.  The green panel had said that pollution in the Yamuna was of serious concern as it was highly contaminated by industrial effluents and sewage.  It had also asked Haryana and Himachal Pradesh Pollution Control Board to jointly conduct a study of water quality and the flow of Yamuna at the point it enters Haryana, and submit the list of industries located in the catchment area.  The green panel had noted that almost 67 per cent of the pollutants reaching Yamuna would be treated by the two sewage treatment plants at Delhi Gate and Najafgarh under the first phase of the 'Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project'.

But we hope to see some turnaround in the current fiscal and we are expecting around 12 per cent increase in revenues and 12-14 per cent increase in order inflows in FY18,"" L&T Group CFO R Shankar Raman told reporters here.For the fiscal, L&T's revenues grew by 7.88 per cent to Rs 110,011 crore against Rs 101,975.34 crore in FY16, while its profit rose 43 per cent to Rs 6,041 crore.L&T won fresh orders worth Rs 142,995 crore at the group level during the year in the face of a challenging business environment. International orders contributed nearly 29 per cent at Rs 41,507 crore of the total order inflow, he said.""Order wins in infrastructure segment, hydrocarbon and heavy engineering segments contributed to the orderflow during the year. The orders that we bagged in Q4, nearly 30 per cent were from domestic market. This we hope is the beginning of the investment cycle in the domestic market which will enable increase in capacity utilisation,"" Raman said.On the order inflows from the international market, Raman said there has been a slowdown especially from the Middle East mainly due to the falling of oil prices.""These markets have adopted conservative mode of investment. At the same time, we have decided to be selective in our approach while bidding and so there is a deliberate low intake,"" he said.Company's Group Executive Chairman AM Naik said, ""the times are very challenging but we continue to feel the prospects are good if the initiatives taken by the government are well implemented.""He said most of the projects, especially in the defence sector which were supposed to come in last fiscal, have been delayed.""The NPD contracts, which were to the tune of over Rs 20,000 crore from the Navy were postponed. If that would have come, we would have surpassed our guidance on order inflows. Orders for six 75 I submarines are not awarded yet and I don't feel it will come in this fiscal as well. The government has allowed strategic partnership with private sector but it should be parallel,"" Naik said.He further said the realty market was also impacted, especially after demonetisation. ""Due to these reasons, we consequently stopped certain projects. But we feel the momentum will be back. We removed nearly Rs 18,000 crore worth of non-moving projects. In the last few years we have adopted this strategy of removing non-moving projects from our order books and we report only executable contracts,"" he said.For FY18, L&T expects orders coming in from hydrocarbons, power, defence and infrastructure segments, exports of heavy machinery, among others.Naik further said there is still time for private sector capex to come into the system.""Today there is enough liquidity with the banks, but they don't want to fund sectors which require resources. The sectors where they want to fund, the promoters are worried about repaying the existing debt and not borrowing. Private sector is almost moving out of the scene and we are looking only if the government can spend,"" he said.Naik said the company is looking at participating in hybrid annuity model based projects and is also exploring opportunities of setting up infrastructure investment trust (InvIT).""We continously look at restructuring our businesses. There could be some restructuring or acquisition in infotech, IT and IT engineering segments. With a debt-equity ratio of 0.23:1, we are in a comfortable position to borrow for such plans. We expect the investments could be around Rs 5,000 crore, which would be a mix of debt and equity,"" he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/larsen-toubro-reports-29-5-per-cent-increase-in-net-profit/articleshow/58906306.cms

Some companies have moved away from the system of allowing employees to accumulate leave in large numbers that could later be encashed at the time of retirement. So when it was revealed that Larsen & Toubro (L&T) group executive chairman A M Naik will take home a retirement benefit of Rs 38 crore, of which encashment of accumulated past service leave alone is an astonishing Rs 32 crore, there was some chatter in HR circles. But then, Naik — a self-professed workaholic who retires as executive chairman at the end of this month and will take over as non-executive chairman from October 1 — rarely took leave from work. Cut to the new generation: While work is passion, taking time off work is treated with equal fervour. Companies keen on hiring and retaining the new generation of workers aren’t following Naik’s example. The Godrej Group has done away with accumulation of consolidated privileged leave (PL). Several others have capped the quantum of accumulated leave to ensure the encashment part does not drive employees to avoid taking time off.However, the law does not mandate companies to do so. When contacted, an L&T spokesperson said, “The company has a Leave Encashment Policy for PL which is part of the overall compensation and benefit programme. The policy is in conformity with the laws of the land, as applicable, and is quite similar to practices followed in the industry.”The L&T spokesperson said not all employees avail of their entire privilege/earned leave quota and therefore the company allows encashment of the unavailed leave according to company rules. “Normally at the time of retirement, employees tend to encash a block of unavailed and accumulated leave,” the spokesperson added.Unlike L&T, Marico has a 30-day cap, beyond which leave does not get accumulated. Emami Group, on the other hand, has a 90-day cap. Such caps force employees to take the balance number of days off, which would otherwise lapse. “For a long-serving employee, any accumulation in excess of 90 days in any year would be automatically encashed at the end of that year,” said an Emami spokesperson.At Siemens, an employee can accumulate leave up to 45 days up to the age of 55 and on resignation. The same is 180 days after 55 years or on retirement. The leave policy at Maersk India largely provisions for a maximum of 30 days of PL, of which all 30 can be carried forward to the subsequent calendar year. But an employee can accumulate a maximum of 60 days of leave from previous years which, if not utilised, can be encashed at the time of expatriation or separation.Maersk Global Services Centre senior director (HR) Pratap G said, “We recognise that flexibility is important and valued by employees and therefore have provision for leaves to be accumulated and carried forward through the year. The encashment can be made at the time of expatriation or processing exit formalities up to defined limits as per local policy. Encashment calculation is done on number of days of unutilised PL at fixed total pay excluding statutory benefits (PF, gratuity).”Most companies follow a uniform leave policy across levels. At Aditya Birla Group, according to its group HR director Santrupt Misra, there are enough controls and limits on any benefit for all categories of employees, including the senior most people in the group.Maersk, too, has a uniform leave policy across levels, but senior employees who are on advisory/consultant roles have a defined involvement percentage in terms of attendance in their respective employment contracts.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/you-wont-get-to-encash-entire-accumulated-leave/articleshow/60963417.cms

In a statement, the chamber said India Inc is looking up to the government to take the 'out of ordinary' measures, citing ""concerns over slowdown in growth due to the transient disruptions in the economy following GST implementation and the remaining over-hang of demonetisation"". Ahead of the credit policy review on October 4, the chamber has also written to the Reserve Bank of India and the Monetary Policy Committee to cut the interest rates by at least by 25 basis points, outlining the challenges faced by the economy which needs immediate measures for revival of growth. ""At least 50 basis points elbow room can be taken with regard to 3.2 per cent fiscal deficit for the current year and the next financial year. ""The fiscal targets can be taken to 3.7 per cent, but with a strict oversight over quality of expenditure so that the extra resources are wisely spent in building and reviving investment in infrastructure sectors like roads, power, railways, ports,"" Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said. He said the present economic scenario requires immediate intervention of the government so that any disruptive impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is minimised. In a letter to RBI Governor Urjit Patel, Assocham said the ""economy is facing multiple challenges as growth is slowing down and investment is not picking up. Consumers have cut down on spending and businesses have also lost momentum"". Stressing that the rupee is still over-valued, the chamber said the effective exchange rate of the rupee has appreciated against India's trading partners, hitting the country's exports. It said the RBI should target the real effective exchange rate more effectively.

Since the note ban last November, the government has been putting in lots of efforts to plug the loopholes in the taxation system using advanced technology and the attempt got an added focus since the Reserve Bank in June had admitted that as much 99 per cent of the banned banknotes had returned to the system, negating the stated intent of cancelling 87 per cent of the notes in circulation. ""That is really advanced analytics. Now, that is like a USD 100-million deal for us. It's not a small deal,"" LT Infotech chief executive and managing director Sanjay Jalona told . Terming the work awarded by the Central Board of Direct Taxes as a ""high volume digital deal"", he elaborated that the project involves creating a 'semantic web' where web pages are structured and tagged in such a way that can be directly read by the computers. ""We are creating a systematic web on a person. If his wife is going to the Seychelles and putting photos on Instagram, we will capture it ... that is really advanced analytics,"" Jalona said. It can be noted that in its efforts to shore up tax collections in a country with among the lowest tax to GDP ratios among its peers, the government has decided to use the best that data analytics offers. A news report last month had said it was a multi-year contract where LTI would operate on a build-own-operate- transfer basis. Jalona said apart from the work on the CBDT project, the company, which was listed last year, is working on other high value digital deals well like a project to digitise parent L&T's construction vertical ""at the core"". This project involves plan and machinery optimisation for the company through interventions like sharing of high cost assets, he said. Jalona said the company is investing continuously on the emerging digital technologies, which now constitutes for 30 per cent of its revenue. He, however, asserted that margins will not be diluted as the company undergoes this change. He said the proportion of digital revenues will keep growing and possibly in two years, everything may be digital for the industry. He said the company is also focusing strongly on blockchain and pointed out to a slew of examples of work with Indian, American and European clients on the front. The technology, which is basically a ledger that is not held by one person, but multiple parties in an open architecture, can be used very effectively for land records, Jalona said.

LT,2017-10-01T09:37:00+05:30,PTI,How clear thinking has helped Dubhashi turn around L&T Finance,"India Business News: Mumbai, Oct 1 () From being an almost crippled player with low RoE and plenty of bad-press till two years ago to one of the top five NBFCs now, L&T Fi","Mumbai, Oct 1 () From being an almost crippled player with low RoE and plenty of bad-press till two years ago to one of the top five NBFCs now, L&T Finance has come a long way, thanks to the turnaround plan sewed up by the new management under chief executive Dinanath Dubhashi. In short, the financial services arm of engineering giant Larsen & Toubro had badly missed the bus and the bull- run that the industry had till last year, but fortunately moved up the ladder in the past six quarters. Today, L&T Finance Holdings is among the top five NBFCs with high return of equity (RoE) and one of the best in terms of asset quality and is among the top NBFCs in terms of market capitalisation. ""To begin with we decided to be a pure-play NBFC as we were confused whether we are an NBFC or a bank. So, we'd to get the right business plan with the right structure in place that means less complexities, the right execution and the right people. To get this moving we had to ensure there's no room for anyone to blame the externalities for their failures. ""So as I started off, I stuck my neck out and said we'll achieve the top quartile RoE by 2020 offering 18-20 per cent by 2020. I'm happy today that we'll be able to achieve this one full year in advance,"" is how Dubhashi recalls the course correction he undertook since taking over in July 2016 as the managing director & chief executive, though the turnaround plan was rolling from April 2016. The focus was on three-four things from beginning -- the right cost structure, getting the right people in and wrong people our and right product and execution strategies. ""First of all, we'd a very heavy cost structure, which was eating into our nimbleness. As an NBFC, we'd to be nimble and fast. Then we'd a laundry list of 20-odd products earlier. To trim them to a sensible level was a key target and so we slashed them to just five now,"" Dubhashi tells in an interview at his office in the Kalina area of the city. It was also saddled with too many loss-making verticals, most of which had no hope of scaling up, admits Dubhashi, who joined L&T Finance in 2007 after stints with BNP Paribas, Care Ratings and SBI Caps. ""We're in construction equipments, cars, where others were doing a better job than us. We're also into tractors and infra finance, where we did well. We also had a very bloated people structure, especially at the mid and top-levels."" Similarly, he has also shuttered most of the verticals and has limited to just five now -- infra and rural financing, housing, MFs and wealth management. ""To be specific, since April 2016 we focused on just four things: growing the focused businesses, fully stop the de-focused business, increases the already high fee income and ensure that cost is strictly controlled by strengthening the balance sheet, putting in place a strong risk management system and making each vertical head fully responsible and accountable,"" says Dubhashi. As a part of the revamp, he stopped disbursements to products classified as defocused and securitised some part of the portfolio to unlock capital. The defocused areas include cars, all types of commercial vehicles, SME term-loans and financing construction equipment, gensets, and three-wheelers. They also had people issues, which was very top-heavy, admits Dubhashi, adding, ""I also ensured that the right-sizing should be aligned to their remuneration as well. So, we linked a large chunk of their pay to performance."" Dubhashi further says to build a sense of ownership at the lower-end, he says his focus is on having more and more people on the ground than at the headquarters or at zonal offices. Today, it is among the top 5 NBFCs in terms of market capitalisation. With an mcap of close to Rs 35,514 crore, L&T Finance is more valued than all other state-run banks barring SBI and is just behind HDFC, Bajaj Finserv and Indiabulls Finance and way ahead of LICHFL, Bajaj Finance etc. HDFC is the most valuable NBFC with Rs 2.77 trillion in mcap. So far in 2017, its share price has surged close 120 per cent, while the Sensex rose only around 19 per cent. Last Friday its stock jumped 2.4 per cent to Rs 195 while the market closed flat after seven consecutive days of losses. The company reported a 49 per cent growth in net for the June quarter at Rs 309 crore when its RoE improved by 385 bps to 13.63 per cent from 9.78 per cent a year ago. Gross NPA decreased by 140 bps to 5.71 per cent. The RoE, Dubhashi says, has already rose to 13.63 per cent in end June, which is well above the average and moved up from a low 9.5 per cent when he took over. By March 2018, he is hopeful of it touching 16 per cent and 18-20 per cent in March 2019 -- one full year ahead of the target. On queried about the staff response to all the radical changes, he quips, ""There wasn't a single voluntary attrition from the top 100. At the mid and lower levels there's been some 10 per cent attrition, which is on par with industry trend. One immediate result is that our cost-to-income ratio has improved to 23 from 33 per cent."" Admitting that they failed on many counts till about FY16, Dubhashi says from FY17 they began to concentrate on five products, the results of which are all visible, as it has been outperforming the market since then. ""But today I want to reiterate that we'll give 18-20 per cent RoE by FY19 itself because I am confident that the past five quarters have been as per plans,"" he concludes.

Larsen & Toubro (L&T), the country’s largest engineering and construction company, has a policy of not hiring children of executive directors till they retire. Also, permission needs to be taken from shareholders if non-executive directors want to induct their children into the company.This is perhaps the first known instance of a large diversified enterprise having a recruitment policy that leaves little room for bias. A M Naik, chairman of the $17-billion L&T, said that because of this policy, “even my son cannot work with the organisation until I retire”. The 75-year-old L&T lifer’s son works with Google in the US. Naik will “step aside” from his executive position this month-end and will move into a non-executive role at the company where he started his career as a junior engineer in 1965. While the policy has ensured that no directors’ official actions are influenced by personal relationships, Naik said that it has had its drawbacks as the company has lost several bright talents to other establishments like Unilever and Infosys. Naik said that there has been only one instance when a non-executive director’s son worked with the company and for this shareholders’ approval was taken. This happened four decades ago and he stayed with L&T for three years. Naik said that had this policy not been there, there would have been allegations of employees favouring their kin. The policy ensures that L&T, according to its oldest executive, remains a professionally managed firm. L&T has seven working directors, including Naik, and 13 non-executive directors. The rule applies to the company’s 117 subsidiaries, too.Nepotism has been a hot topic of debate over recent months after actor Kangana Ranaut accused Bollywood of favouring star kids and the BJP raked up the issue of dynasty politics in the Congress. In several corporates too, especially promoter-driven, prominent posts are held by children, siblings and spouses of directors. There are certain exceptions. Axis Bank has a policy against hiring a staffer’s immediate family members (spouses, siblings and children — including step and adopted). At IT services firm Mindtree, only blood relatives (children) of an employee cannot be recruited, while spouses are allowed.Millionaire club protects L&TIt is known that Infosys has made its employees millionaires by offering them stock options. A traditional company like L&T, too, has created wealthy staffers. Nearly 2,500 L&Tites have become millionaires over the last one and a half decades. The first time the company issued shares to employees was in 2003, soon after it warded off a takeover from Aditya Birla Group. L&T’s share price has risen from Rs 23.48 (adjusted for all corporate actions) in 2003 to Rs 1,185 now. The employee stock options (Esops), which is 7-8%, also acts as a fence against any unwarranted acquisitions, besides the 12.5% held by L&T Employee Foundation. Naik said that this structure (L&T Employee Foundation and Esops) ensures that it won’t be easy to take over the company as 20% is a big chunk to buy. “Also, we have ensured that the stock remains expensive so that no one can afford it.” L&T aims to increase its market cap to Rs 2.50 lakh crore from the current Rs 1.65 lakh crore by the end of this decade.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/at-lt-no-hiring-executive-directors-kids-till-they-retire/articleshow/60848283.cms

The structure of the partnership could mirror a deal struck by Canadian asset manager Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ) with Edelweiss group for investing in stressed assets in October last year.  60761728   NIIF was set up 18 months ago as a quasi-sovereign wealth fund. It roped in Bose, former global head of infrastructure investments at International Finance Corporation, as its CEO last year. NIIF’s board comprises Garg, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman Ajay Tyagi and former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das.  The government-sponsored fund is also separately said to be in discussions with Middle East-based sovereign wealth funds to arrange commitments as it looks to put together a corpus of $5 billion to support infrastructure investments in railways, ports and the renewable energy sector.  It may raise the proceeds in an existing fund management company.  Ottawa-headquartered PSP or Public Sector Pension Investment Board manages over $100 billion in investments for retired officials of Canada’s public service, armed forces and police. It acquired ownership of four toll road projects in India totalling 710 kilometres in length as part of a global transaction in which it purchased the assets of Spanish infrastructure group Isolux Corsan in five countries last year.  ‘LOW-RISK INVESTMENTS’ “Many road projects are financially unviable because traffic projections did not materialise. Longterm investors such as pension funds would still find these attractive because they are looking at low-risk investments and have a 20-year horizon,” said Naresh Takkar, group CEO at Moody’s local rating arm, ICRA.  OTPP, a Canadian pension fund that manages investments of 182,000 school teachers in Ontario, has deployed roughly a fourth of its corpus of $140 billion in real estate and infrastructure investments globally. It is an investor in London City Airport, the Chicago Skyway toll road and owns a number of retail and commercial properties in Canada.  The fund has largely refrained from making direct investments in India, though it is an investor in online commerce firm Snapdeal.  The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the nodal agency for the award of contracts for road projects, awards long-term concessions to contractors to build and operate projects and recover proceeds through tolls. It also offers annuity-based projects where the developer bears the cost of constructing the project and receives annuity payments from NHAI as reimbursement over a period of time.  Canadian investors have been scouting investment opportunities in India. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board struck a deal with Larsen and Toubro to invest Rs 1,000 crore in its road projects arm three years ago.

Shares of Infosys plunged by nearly 10 per cent on Friday wiping out Rs 22,519 crore from its market valuation, after Sikka's resignation. It fell further by over 5 per cent yesterday despite buyback announcement by the company. Sharp decline in Infosys share prices wiped out Rs 34,000 crore of investors' wealth in last two days. Snapping two day continuous fall, shares of Infosys closed 0.42 per cent up at Rs 877.15 per unit on the BSE. The country's second largest software services firm on Saturday announced that its board approved a share buyback offer of up to Rs 13,000 crore. ""We are keeping a watch on Infosys share prices,"" Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi said here today. Amid allegation of corporate governance lapses, Infosys co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Venkatesan met the minister and is believed to have apprised him of the developments at Infosys as also the steps being taken to keep the shareholders informed, sources said. The Sebi chief said the regulator will stick to its December deadline for linking Aadhaar with e-KYC for trading accounts. The move is aimed at curbing money laundering and tax evasion through stock markets. All demat account holders are required to link their accounts with Aadhaar by December 31, 2017. In case of failure to submit the documents within the prescribed time limit, the account would be suspended till the Aadhaar details are submitted by the client. Last week, the BSE asked trading and clearing members to report preparedness for furnishing Aadhaar details of their clients. While trading members have to submit report on their preparedness by August 23, clearing members and custodians have to do the same by August 25. In compliance with the amended Prevention of Money Laundering norms, banks have already sought Aadhaar details from their customers. When asked about more action against shell companies, Tyagi said, ""wherever there is a violation of securities law, they have to be investigated and looked into irrespective of whether it is shell or whatever name you give them. One does not wait for any reference from anywhere"". Earlier this month, Sebi directed bourses to initiate action against 331 suspected shell companies that are listed and these scrips will not be available for trading this month. The regulator's directive came after the corporate affairs ministry shared a list of 331 listed companies that are suspected to be shell entities and could even face ""compulsory delisting"". So far, around 10 companies have won relief from the Securities Appellate Tribunal. He also said that panel on corporate governance is expected to submit its report by the end of September. In a bid improve standards of corporate governance of listed companies, Sebi set up a committee in June under the chairmanship of Uday Kotak, chief of Kotak Mahindra Bank.

The delivery of the C-433 and C-434 high speed interceptor ships is part of the two contracts being executed by L&T for design and construction of 54 interceptors to the Indian Coast Guard, valued at Rs 1,424 crore, the company said in a statement issued here. With these two, 34 interceptors have been delivered by the company, so far, it said. ""We appreciate the urgent need of Indian Coast Guard to augment coastal security in these turbulent times. Our production is over one year ahead of schedule and we are ready to deliver the remaining 20 vessels to Coast Guard anytime suiting their operational requirements,"" company's CEO and Managing Director SN Subrahmanyan said. Besides interceptor vessels programme, L&T has also been mandated by the Coast Guard to design and build seven offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), its senior executive vice president (Defence) and whole time director JD Pati said. ""The construction of OPVs is on schedule and the launch of first OPV is slated for next month. All these ships constructed are designed in-house. The deliveries re-affirm our capabilities to consistently execute and deliver defence projects on time using indigenous design and technologies,"" he said.

LT,2017-08-13T10:31:00+05:30,"Suman Layak,Rahul Sachitanand","Here is how private cos like Jio, Flipkart, Paytm are helping India in nation building","India Business News: Entrepreneurship zeal is helping solve problems with innovative solutions, leapfrogging western developmental models with innovation.","Forty-year-old Ramesh Chandra runs a small steel furniture shop in Nandganj, a town to the east of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district. He also makes small iron boxes and runs a workshop that employs six people. Ramesh’s wife Rukmini, 38, is an equal partner, who helps run the show if Ramesh has to be away for a while. Till last year, it was usually bank work that would keep Ramesh away, often for more than a couple of hours at a time.  However, this year there has been a welcome change, after a payment bank opened next door. Chandra and Rukmini now get doorstep banking. In fact, Rukmini has taken charge of savings and investments of the family and the six employees now get their wages in their own bank accounts. While Fino PayTech is the payment bank helping Ramesh and Rukmini, more new-age banking players have forayed into Nandganj. Financial inclusion riding on easy availability of data services has made its presence felt here — while the journey to Varanasi, barely 60 km away, still takes more than two hours. For Rukmini and Ramesh, India has travelled to their Bharat, not by road but through banking.  The idea of building a country is often tied to the creation of infrastructure: the temples of modern India that Jawaharlal Nehru spoke about. However, today nation-building has started to mean much more than large infrastructure projects. Metaphorical pipes bringing in data and financial literacy are as important as those carrying water, gas or petroleum. Sometimes they actually share space: for example, optical fibre cables laid under railway tracks. But are new-age financial services players like Fino or Paytm, ecommerce ventures like Flipkart or Amazon and data evangelists like Google or Reliance Jio also helping build our country? Can their very different kind of contribution hold a candle to Indian private sector behemoths likes Larsen & Toubro (L&T) or Tata Steel, which built steel plants, power plants, ports, airports, tollroads and bridges — and in the process helped products and services reach underdeveloped areas?  L&T chairman AM Naik has an answer, in his own inimitable style: “In our generation, it was always the country first, then the society, then company and lastly self. We had the vision of working for the country. New-age entrepreneurs are constantly talking about valuation. Maybe only one out of 10 are thinking about the country.”  From Pariahs to Partners To understand the psyche of the new-age entrepreneur vis-a-vis the Nehruvian notion of nation-building, rewind to the early ’90s, when economic liberalisation was ushered in by the Narasimha Rao government with Manmohan Singh as finance minister. Most large infrastructure sectors were the preserve of the public sector till then. Naik himself recalls how he had unsuccessfully sought an offshore licence “52 times” before the offshore sector was finally opened up.  JJ Irani, former Tata Steel managing director and vice-chairman, told ET Magazine that the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru thought profit was a dirty word. “I have heard it from JRD Tata. Though JRD and Nehru were friends, Nehru had a very different vision for the country.” Irani recalls how large government factories, built with Soviet help, would lie unused, but the private sector was never allowed to use them as there was no trust.  60042416   Irani says the governments of the ’60s and ’70s built tariff walls to prevent foreign businesses entering into India. “They wanted to keep the wolves out, but they ended up preventing Indian tigers from conquering the world.” Irani points out that as a result when the economy was opened up, the Indian private sector was ill-prepared. “You will recall all the television makers, including Tata’s Nelco, went out of business when the foreign companies came in.” RPG Group chairman Harsh Goenka recalls how the group engaged McKinsey to understand what it needs to do to survive, and the main recommendation was to prune its portfolio of 18 businesses to six. “At that time, even selling a business was taboo; we had a lot to learn,” says Goenka.  “Only in the last 20 years the Indian private sector has had some say,” says Naik. This is also the period when it has contributed to nationbuilding. Business sectors like oil and gas, aviation, telecom, steel, power generation saw huge growth. In the last 16 years, India’s road network went up from 33 lakh km to 54 lakh km, becoming the second largest in the world. In the last 10 years, India’s tele-density went up from 14.6% to 82%. India’s installed power generation capacity went up from 85 GW in 1997 to 330 GW in 2017. Aviation passenger traffic grew from mere 15,000 in 1990 to 100 million in 2016.  With growing business came greater profitability and corporate philanthropy. Education, healthcare, water and sanitation were focus areas, with the private sector outspending Indian public sector by three times. Total CSR spend in India exceeded Rs 5,000 crore in 2015.  The Tata Trusts are one of the oldest and have been around for more than eight decades and control the Tata empire. Other foundations created by private sector like the ones by Wipro chairman Azim Premji or Reliance Industries or Infosys also pushed boundaries with their work. Naik, on the verge of moving on to a non-executive chairman’s role at L&T, has pledged 75% of his personal wealth for philanthropy. He also heads five trusts focused on philanthropy: while two are personal, another two are L&T employees’ trusts and the last , an L&T company trust.  Leapfrogging for Bharat While the old-economy stalwarts often reached out to the lesser developed parts of the country through CSR, entrepreneurs of the day seem to be reaching out with ideas and products tailored for the other India, or Bharat. Entrepreneurship zeal is helping solve problems with innovative solutions, leapfrogging western developmental models with innovation.  Take for example Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm and the poster-boy of digital payments. Paytm started as a mobile wallet and is now a payments bank. Sharma feels technology will be at the heart of the future and success will not be measured by size but by future readiness. In the case of Paytm, this meant quickly growing a company that provided just payment solutions for 250 million people into a banking offering that can shake up the old guard.  60042417   So how is he contributing to the cause of nation-building? The short answer from Sharma would be, by building innovative solutions to the country’s problems. Sharma explains: “The old business idea of banking was replicated on a costly western model, which excluded a billion people from accessing basic banking services.” And then, answering the question raised by Naik, Sharma adds: “We are building a business that doesn’t exist anywhere in the world and will provide a low-cost, scalable solution to dramatically improve financial inclusion.”  Financial inclusion itself has to ride on digital and data inclusion. Reliance Industries has pushed big money into the data sector — an example of an old-economy giant riding a new horse. Internet search behemoth Google’s India chief Rajan Anandan says Google has taken upon itself a mission to provide Internet connectivity to a billion Indians. “To make the internet accessible for around a billion people, the solutions are going to look completely different from those used by the first 100 million users.”  Facebook and Microsoft also have similar projects to build connectivity across India. And, in that battle, lower smartphone handset prices are another enabler — where Reliance Industries has made its latest push, offering a feature phone with basic internet, virtually for free. Fino CEO Rishi Gupta says he noted, during a visit to Nandganj, that Ramesh and Rukmini’s 15-year-old son is an active smartphone user and Gupta has identified the child as a future vehicle for pushing more sophisticated banking services.  Google has moved further with initiatives like Internet Saathi, which trains women in rural areas on the internet. Ten million have been trained in 2,00,000 villages already. Free wi-fi is likely to go live at 200 railway stations by the end of this year. The stage is now set for made-for-Bharat products. Google itself has started a local language push, offline apps and voice search. It is also working with small businesses to bring them online.  Anandan says: “India is now the land of a billion opportunities, with massive white spaces — we need to build from the ground up.” He adds that for India’s new nation builders, the solutions for the next billion Indians for healthcare, education or transportation will look completely different from what’s in the market.  And government services are also running on the internet. Internet gear maker Cisco believes that the internet is changing the way people interact with the government. “The focus has to be on providing government services at scale to citizens,” says VC Gopalratnam, SVP-IT and CIO-International, Cisco. “There’s an opportunity for the next generation of nation builders to use the internet across other sectors such as education, healthcare, and transportation.”  The larger conglomerates also have their job cut out. Naik of L&T says the private sector should be allowed to play a larger role with the government just providing the enabling infrastructure.  Goenka feels little has been done in increasing agricultural productivity and identifies it as the one area where India lags behind. “The concept of small is beautiful, has not been able to deliver agri-productivity and the private sector must look for a way in which it can play a larger role, which is tough without land ownership,” he says. Goenka adds one of the tasks ahead is to find a viable model for partnering with the farming community that can lead to less fragmented land holdings and therefore greater productivity. For Ramesh and Rukmini of Nandganj, that will also mean more demand and a better future.

Larsen & Toubro Ltd had filed the application before the Directorate General of Antidumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) for initiation of anti-dumping probe on imports of a certain type of castings for wind operated electricity generators exported from China. Castings for wind-operated electricity generators are also known as windmill or wind turbine. In its final findings, DGAD has concluded that the product has been exported to India from China at below normal values. ""Material injury has been caused by the dumped imports"" of the product, it has said in a notification. The DGAD ""considers it necessary to recommend imposition of definitive anti-dumping duty on imports"" from China, it added. The product is already attracting anti-subsidy or countervailing duty. DGAD has recommended a duty equivalent to the difference between the quantum of anti-dumping duty calculated and the quantum of anti-subsidy duty payable. Countries impose anti-dumping duties to guard domestic industry from surge in below-cost imports. India has also imposed similar duties on import of several other products including steel, fabrics and chemicals from different countries including China. Anti-dumping steps are taken to ensure fair trade and provide a level-playing field to the domestic industry. They are not a measure to restrict import or cause an unjustified increase in cost of products.

DGAD had initiated an inquiry into the import of castings from China in early 2016 following a petition filed by Larsen & Toubro. 59906476 L&T subsequently sold off its Coimbatore plant to Brandken India Pvt Ltd in March 2016, but authorities found merit in its complaint.The report on the investigation concludes that the castings were being “exported to India from the subject country (China) below normal values” and that “the domestic industry has suffered material injury” on account of such exports. ET reviewed a copy of the report.“Having initiated and conducted the investigation into dumping, injury and the causal link thereof in terms of the rules and having established positive subsidy margins as well as injury to the domestic industry caused by such subsidised imports, the authority is of the view that imposition of anti-dumping duty is required to offset dumping and injury,” it said.Castings comprise a number of vital parts of a wind turbine, including the hub, mainframe, various shafts, axles and more.Wind industry insiders said they add up to about 3 per cent of the total cost of the turbine and that once the anti-dumping duty is imposed, their cost could go up by 5-20 per cent. Wind energy tariffs dropped spectacularly from the previous Rs 4-5 per kwH to Rs 3.46 per kwH in the first and only auction of wind projects held in February this year, but the imposition of anti-dumping duty now could reverse the trend unless developers absorb the extra cost.“The cost of setting up a wind project will rise by about Rs 30 lakh per MW to Rs 50 lakh per MW,” said Madhusudan Khemka, managing director at ReGen Powertech, one of the leading wind turbine manufacturers. A wind developer who did not want to be named said, “Unless the cost is passed on, our internal rate of return (IRR) will fall by about 2 per cent.”A number of other manufacturers contacted by ET, however, refused to respond. The development is likely to set off alarm bells among solar developers as well, because solar equipment manufacturers have also filed a similar petition with DGAD in June this year against dumping of Chinese solar cells and modules. Solar tariffs have also fallen steeply in recent years, thanks to cheap imports from China, but if the manufacturers’ plea is upheld, tariffs are bound to rise.The DGAD report recommending anti-dumping duty on castings from China specifically names six Chinese companies and the duties they should be slapped with: Zhejiang Jiali Wind Power Technology, 6.27 per cent; Jiangsu Sinojit Wind Energy Technology and its associate companies, 14.44 per cent; Yeong Guan Energy Tech Group, 15.46 per cent; Dalian Huarui Heavy Industry Casting, 18.48 per cent; Nangtong Hongde Mechanical, 18.64 per cent; and Jiangsu Faw Foundry, 28.83 per cent.

BHEL beat Larsen & Toubro and Korea's Doosan, which were eyeing the contract which includes engineering, procurement and construction of three 800 MW units coal-fired power plant being built by NTPC and the Patratu Thermal Power Station.The project was estimated to be worth around Rs 14,000 crore, but BHEL's is slated to win it with the lowest bid of Rs 11,628 crore, three sources in the know told ET.  ""BHEL's bid is remarkably low as steel prices have gone up almost 20% in the last two quarters and the pro ject also includes air pollution control system, which will make it expensive. The industry did not expect the bids to be cheaper than Rs 6 crore per megawatt,"" said a top executive from a power company that was not in the race for the project.  BHEL's bid was worth Rs 11,628 crore translating into Rs 4.8 crore per MW. It is 13.7 per cent cheaper than L&T's Rs 13,220 crore. Doosan's bid was significantly higher at Rs 22,792 crore, sources said.  The companies were keen to bag this project as it was one of the rare active bids in the beleaguered thermal power sector, where generators are not taking up new projects due to lack of demand from state-run power distri bution companies. With few major investments in the conventional power sector, companies such as BHEL, L&T and Thermax have been left with weak order pipelines and low capacity utilisation of 25-30 per cent.  59644646   While the low bid will benefit NTPC, some industry executives raised concerns over BHEL's ability to execute the project at such low margins.  ""BHEL's bid does not factor in the current input cost, let alone the likely increase in costs going ahead,"" another senior industry executive said.  NTPC declined to comment since it has not yet made a formal announcement. BHEL could not be reached for a response.  In a report last month, Axis Securities said that on a like-for-like basis, boiler and turbine-generator pricing has increased by 15 per cent over the past 12 months due to ""return of rational biding"".

With the critical viaduct on the corridor III over railway lines and Begumpet railway station complete, the extension of the 8-km stretch of Nagole-Mettuguda up to Begumpet has now become technically feasible. The Begumpet RoB, one of the trickiest construction sites which was termed an engineering nightmare by the Metro rail authorities, has been built in three parts with the main portion (span) over the railway lines and railway station being 213-foot long and both ends being 130-foot and 107-foot long respectively. Also, it was done under challenging conditions with busy railway lines, round-the-clock train movement and a large number of passengers using the station.There are eight locations on the Metro network where the viaduct cross over railway tracks. Of the eight, Oliphant and Alugaddabavi (both on corridor III) were the most challenging tasks for Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) engineers. ""Alugaddabavi Metro bridge has been completed recently, while the crucial and the most-challenging Oliphant RoB will be ready in another month,"" Metro authorities said.Apart from these two bridges, which are the only steel bridges with no pillar support for 82 metres and 76 metres respectively, Begumpet RoB was a huge engineering challenge. The Begumpet RoB, which has a length of 137 metres and in a curve, is wedged between the Begumpet flyover on one side and several buildings on the other. ""A special device, 'bridge builder', which weighs around 100 metric tons was used for the RoB given its curved nature, long length and 60 feet height. Heavy-duty cranes were used to lift precast segments without causing disruption to the continuous movement of trains, station operations, passengers and road traffic,"" HMRL managing director NVS Reddy said. The Begumpet RoB has taken nearly a year to be completed, while the Oliphant Metro bridge has been underway for a couple of months now. Since only the railways has the expertise to build bridges with a span (bridge suspension without support) of 80 to 120 metres, engineers from the South Central Railway (SCR) were supervising the construction work.To keep construction time at the site minimal, the entire steel bridge, weighing about 1,100 tons made of special high grade steel, was first manufactured and assembled at a factory in Ghaziabad, simulating the site conditions near the Oliphant bridge, and later it was dismantled piece by piece and brought here for reassembling.  Since the Oliphant bridge is a double-elevation RoB over an already existing elevated one, and keeping in mind the need of accommodating future double-decker trains, the bridge is being built at a height of 60 feet from the road level. Operations on the route might take a while to begin. The Metro rail authorities have recently decided that of the two completed metro stretches (Miyapur-SR Nagar and Nagole-Mettuguda), they would begin operations on the 11-km Miyapur-SR Nagar segment first. based on the experience, the Nagole -Mettuguda-Begumpet route would be made operational. The HMRL, meanwhile, has got an extension till November 2018. As per the original agreement, July 4 was the deadline for the 'concessionaire' Larsen and Toubro (L&T) to complete the three corridors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/metro-miracle-critical-begumpet-link-in-place/articleshow/59509520.cms

Larsen & Toubro (L&T)has decided to close the old Mandovi bridge at night for a few hours to allow trucks carrying concrete to pour the concrete for the erection of the third pylon that is in the river.The move, however has caught late night motorists by surprise who say that the city administration and traffic police have not provided sufficient illumination or warning near the diversion, at the old Mandovi bridge circle.“That L&T is doing a major part of the work on the Mandovi bridge at night, is commendable, as road closures and diversions hardly affect traffic during those hours. But they should ensure that the blockade on the old Mandovi bridge is illuminated so that it doesn't take motorists by surprise,” Marie Fernandes said.“Normally, the concrete is poured from the boat for the third pylon. But if that gets choked, then we have to use the bridge. This is for one or two nights. We are not doing it every night,” a GSIDC official explained.The bridge is usually closed after midnight for approximately two hours. Barricades are placed just before the bridge starts. A single man with an illuminated wand alerts driver and riders of the diversion.“Traffic is diverted only at night due to the work going on. I would rather be safe than sorry. Also, since the bridge road has been done up, it is really no problem at all. Only, the authorities should look into more illumination on the bridge,” said Rhea Pinto who travels late night.Commuters have also expressed concern over the large halogen lights placed on the northern side of the bridge. “The powerful in-your-face lights put up by L&T at night, blind drivers and riders along the road leading up from the bridges. Many a times, trailers carrying material and equipment for the construction work are parked on the right side of the road, and are completely obscured by the halogen . This is a major accident waiting to occur,” said Sandesh Naik.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gsidcs-midnight-closure-of-old-mandovi-bridge-gets-mixed-response/articleshow/59393713.cms

The Navy was examining whether Indian companies have the capacity to build submarine, aircraft/ fighter jets, helicopter and armoured vehicles. ""We are looking at Indian partners. We will identify the Indian partners as they have to pass through technical and financial gates. So, we are looking at top of the line people,"" he said. Admitting that the domestic ship building industry had been in the dump for a while, he said the defence ship building in the country presented a huge market as well as huge challenge and Navy wanted private shipyards to ease the load of public sector units. The Navy had chalked out a maritime perspective plan. ""We have earmarked which are the ships that needs to be built by defence PSUs. What we are looking at -- is private shipyards play a role and they can ease the load of defence PSUs. So that we can have a load share between defence PSU and private shipyards,"" he said.

An amount of Rs 184 crore has been sanc tioned to build the bridge. As per the govern ment order issued on Friday, approving the bid by MS Larsen and Toubro Limited, Rs 92 crore will be contributed by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) while another Rs 92 crore will be contributed by the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC). A defect liability period of 120 months has been decided upon for the bridge, which has been designed to reduce the peakhour traffic congestion in the IT corridor. The idea, say sources, is to reduce the traffic congestion presently being formed due to heavy flow of vehicles between the IT corridor and the Banjara HillsJubilee Hills stretch during peak hours.According to the GO, the hanging bridge will be constructed from Road No 45 Jubilee Hills to Inorbit Mall over Durgam Cheruvu within two years. The tender process required bidders to be experienced in construction of suspension bridge.“The government, after careful examination of the matter, accorded approval for single bid of MS Larsen & Toubro Limited at their quoted offer with a tender contract value of Rs 146 crore and also permitted the commissioner of the GHMC to start the work duly entering into the agreement and to acquire land properties for construction of cable-stayed bridge across Durgam Cheruvu at Madhapur,“ read the order issued by special chief secretary to government, MG Gopal.Meanwhile, the process for acquisition of land and properties will start within a fortnight, said insiders at the GHMC.City-based environmentalists are predictably worried over the latest development.“The natural surroundings around the water body will also be disturbed by this project. Any kind of infrastructure should not be located this close to a water body. The state government has to carry out a detailed environmental impact assessment before works to construct the hanging bridge are kicked off. Additionally, the hanging bridge will only increase the vehicular load on city roads.If the state government is really trying to ease traffic congestion, they must focus on strengthening public transport instead of adding more road infrastructure within the city,“ said environmentalist Capt Rama Rao.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/government-nod-for-hanging-bridge-on-durgam-cheruvu/articleshow/55136611.cms

The first batch of the 155mm/52 calibre tracked self- propelled (SP) gun -- K9 VAJRA-T -- will be delivered later this year and the entire supply will be made within next 42 months. L&T, supported by its South Korean technology partner Hanwha Tech Win (HTW), had bid for the contract in 2011. The contract valued at about at Rs 4,500 crore is the largest order placed by the Defence Ministry (MoD) with an Indian private company, Jayant Patil, Head of Defence and Aerospace at L&T, said. Among the four bidders, L&T emerged as the sole qualified aspirant, after a series of user trials and evaluations, based on the performance of the K9 VAJRA-T self-propelled Howitzer. The K9 VAJRA-T gun is an enhanced version of HTW's K9 Thunder - a world class self-propelled howitzer, customised and co-developed by L&T and HTW to suit the specific requirements of the Indian Army. HTW's K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzer is among the best in the world with over 1,000 units already in service in South Korea and few other countries. Patil said the award of the contract affirms L&T's position as India's leading private sector defence company with capabilities to design, develop and manufacture state- of-the-art platforms and systems for the Indian armed forces. Patil said the contract envisages delivery of the 100 guns in 42 months with associated engineering support package and maintenance throughout their life cycle. The guns will have over 50 per cent indigenous content and will be delivered from L&T's manufacturing facilities, Patil said. L&T had inked a deal with Hanwha Techwin (HTW) last month to jointly manufacture the self-propelled howitzers for Indian Army.

LT,2017-05-08T08:44:00+05:30,Manu Pubby,"PMO, Jaitley push clears path for big private role in defence production","India Business News: It is expected that four projects will be taken up in the first phase of the strategic partnership project — new submarines, a naval utility helicopte","NEW DELHI: The defence ministry seems to have unlocked the strategic partnership (SP) logjam with a firm push from the Prime Minister’s Office and sustained focus by defence minister Arun Jaitley, setting up the private sector to play a major role in the production of weapons systems for the armed forces.  A tussle within the bureaucracy over what rules the SP model would follow had resulted in a stalemate within the ministry since February 2016, frustrating leading private sector companies that were expecting to get mega production orders for aircraft, submarines and land systems, a traditional stronghold of the public sector.  Sources have told ET that a series of meetings, particularly one held in the PMO last week, have given the last-mile push to the initiative.  Top private sector representatives from three industrial bodies have now been invited by the defence ministry for a meeting on Tuesday, where the government is expected to unveil progress made. It is expected that four projects will be taken up in the first phase of the strategic partnership project — new submarines, a naval utility helicopter, a single-engine fighter aircraft for the air force and armoured vehicles for the army. The armed forces, the navy in particular, are keen to move fast on the concept to meet urgent requirements and address the equipment deficit.  “There is no doubt that involving the private sector in this way is the best way forward. Most of the issues have been resolved and the initiative needs to be started on a ‘yesterday’ basis — there is no time to be lost,” a senior armed forces officer involved in the discussions on the matter told ET.  Contentious issues, including objections from a certain section of the bureaucracy on how to ensure competitiveness after choosing a certain private sector player as a strategic partner for a specific role like, say, shipbuilding, has resulted in rules not being framed, despite the policy being announced as an integral part of India’s defence procurement policy since early last year.  Officials said a middle ground has been found on most issues, the driving force being specific directions from the PMO that the private sector needs to get a significant chunk of military orders, given that the current model being followed, to push most orders to the public sector, has not been yielding the desired results.  “There are ways to resolve issues. The objection on the longterm covenant for example cannot hold as anyone making a system like submarines or fighter jets will have to be involved for a 20-25-year lifetime of the product,” a senior government official said.  Though initially a divided house on modalities of the SP model, the private sector too is now on board with the government’s new push. Several industry leaders that ET spoke with said on condition of anonymity that the principle was always accepted but now issues like the selection process and division of work have been resolved.  A formal selection process is yet to begin but internal deliberations indicate that six major Indian companies interested in the sector will be able to qualify on financial grounds to be chosen for the strategic partnership model. This includes the relevant units of Larsen & Toubro, Tata, Mahindra & Mahindra, Reliance Defence, Bharat Forge and the Adani Group. Projects worth several billion dollars are expected to be unlocked for the private sector, analysts said.  “Through SP policy, programmes estimated to be in excess of $20 billion will open up and an attempt will be made to bring the private sector on par with DPSUs (defence public sector units) in terms of opportunity,” said Ankur Gupta, vice-president, EY India. “Post policy rollout, the private sector has to make necessary investments to leverage this bold government initiative and deliver on the large-ticket programmes.”  As per the current plan, only one company will be allowed to undertake one strategic project and would not qualify to compete for others. This has thrown up a unique challenge for companies such as Tata and L&T that have diversified interests in the field.  Tata, for example, could want to compete for the armoured vehicles project through its Tata Motors subsidiary and for the naval helicopter contract through Tata Advanced Systems (TASL). More clarity is expected on the matter at Tuesday’s meeting.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pmo-jaitley-push-clears-path-for-big-private-role-in-defence-production/articleshow/58569116.cms

The 20-year IT arm of EPC major Larsen & Toubro, which rebranded itself as LTI today, posted a 16.1 per cent growth in post tax net at Rs 970.9 crore for FY17. The company's chief executive and managing director Sanjay Jalona said it is targeting a 14-15 per cent jump in profits for FY 18. Its total revenues were up 7.7 per cent to Rs 1,677.2 crore while the pre-tax profit margin expanded 1.20 per cent to 16.5 per cent during the quarter. The margin expansion was on the back of a surge in digital revenues which now constitute 28 per cent of the total revenues from 20 per cent in year-ago period and also a jump in utilisation, its chief financial officer A K Sonthalia said over the phone. He said for the fiscal as a whole, the utilisation rate increased by 4 percentage points to 78.3 per cent. The company added 1,000 employees on a net basis during the fiscal and 400 during the quarter, to take the total strength to 21,023, he said. The attrition improved to 16.9 per cent during the quarter from 18.4 per cent in the year-ago period. The company will come out with wage hikes in July like it does normally, and may broadly stick to the range of 6-7 per cent for domestic employees and 2-3 per cent for foreign ones, Jalona said, stressing that it is yet to be firmed up. The company, which has almost 65 per cent of its revenues coming from the US, is stepping up hiring in America because of the ongoing concerns around protectionist policies, Jalona said. As the 'near-shoring' of work increases, the company has also opened up a centre in Warsaw, Poland and a subsidiary in Mexico during the last fiscal, he said. It may open a 500-seat development centre at its Pune facility during this fiscal, he said, declining to give a guidance on its hiring plans. The company board also decided to appoint S N Subrahmanyan -- who is set to be chairman A M Naik's successor -- as the non executive vice-chairman with immediate effect. The board declared a final dividend of Rs 9.70 per equity share of Re 1 for FY17. The company scrip corrected by 0.10 per cent to close at Rs 708.95 a piece on the BSE, as against a 0.77 per cent jump in the benchmark.

It depends on North America, where there are growing voices of protectionism, for 62.9 per cent of revenue, followed by Europe at 19.1 per cent, rest of the world at 10.1 per cent and India at 7.9 per cent. From a sectoral perspective, the transportation and industrial products vertical had the most concentration accounting for 60 per cent of the revenue.

Reliance Infra-controlled RDEL has received approval from the CDR empowered group (CDR EG) for exiting the CDR scheme. ""As part of the refinancing scheme approved by the lenders, the door-to-door tenure of RDEL's term loans stands extended to 18 years,"" the company said in a statement. The consortium of lenders, led by IDBI, had agreed to the exit plan of RDEL with a longer maturity period for loans worth about Rs 6,800 crore. Pursuant to the refinancing scheme, RDEL's existing debt of about Rs 650 crore will also be converted into equity shares at a price of Rs 59.35 per equity share, it said. Shareholders of RDEL by an overwhelming majority of 100 per cent had already approved the issue of equity shares to lenders by conversion of debt, at the extraordinary general meeting held on March 20, 2017. ""In line with the RBI approval, RInfra through its subsidiary has also increased its shareholding in RDEL to nearly 31 per cent,"" the company said. The approval by CDR EG makes RDEL eligible for participating in all future contracts of the Navy. Now, RDEL and Larsen & Toubro are the only two private sector shipyards that will compete with government-owned shipyards for prestigious contracts for making submarines, landing platform dock (LPD) and corvette. Exiting CDR is also expected to provide increased financial manoeuvring to the company. RDEL's current order stands at over Rs 5,300 crore from the Navy, the Coast Guard and commercial vessels. Reliance Infra had acquired Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Company in March 2015, which was later renamed as Reliance Defence and Engineering. Immediately after the acquisition, Reliance Group had announced its plans to exit CDR. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had also given its nod to RDEL to exit the CDR package. The stock of RDEL was trading at Rs 68.55 on the BSE, up 5.87 per cent from its previous close.

The financial services firm of engineering-to-software conglomerate Larsen & Toubro, which had initially planned to sell a minority stake in L&T Mutual Fund, is now scouting for buyers to take over the asset management company, said two people familiar with the development.  L&T Mutual Fund had Rs 39,300 crore of assets under management as of March 31. The mutual fund industry managed assets worth Rs 18.3 lakh crore.  L&T Finance is said to be seeking a valuation of close to Rs 2,000 crore for the mutual fund arm, valuing the business at roughly 5% of assets under management. While a banker is yet to be appointed for the transaction, it has asked a US bank to search for buyers. In response to an ET query, an L&T Finance spokesperson said, “We would not like to comment on rumours or speculation.”  L&T Finance had earlier planned to sell 26% or 49% in the mutual fund as part of its restructuring plans but was unable to find buyers because they were not interested in a minority stake, forcing L&T to consider selling the entire business. “The thinking at L&T is that if it has to sell a majority stake in L&T Mutual Fund, it might as well sell it entirely,” said an official familiar with the plans.  Steep Valuation: Rival Funds A lot has changed for L&T Mutual from the time its parent decided to sell a minority stake in early 2016. Its assets under management have risen almost 60% from roughly Rs 25,000 crore in the March quarter of 2016.  Industry officials said it has paid higher fees to distributors to garner more assets. The fund house has also cut costs mainly by reducing employee strength.  Top officials at some rival mutual funds, which are believed to be among those interested in buying the business, said the valuation that L&T has asked for is steep even though the industry is in the pink of health, led by record inflows. One official said a deal could be struck at between Rs 1,200 crore and Rs 1,500 crore.  This is partly because a chunk of L&T Mutual Fund’s assets is said to be inflows from the parent. Also, margins in the business are relatively low, making it imperative for the buyer to ensure that the acquired assets under management remain intact.  L&T Mutual surprised the markets in 2012 when it announced the acquisition of Fidelity Mutual Fund, which was almost double its size then, for about Rs 550 crore.  While L&T has been able to expand its assets since then, industry officials said the fund house has struggled to recover the acquisition costs.  They said L&T Mutual will be a good fit for a smaller sized mutual fund looking to boost assets, especially equity.  The fund house manages Rs 12,000-13,000 crore in equity schemes, which is about 30% of its total assets under management, according to industry estimates.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lt-finance-plans-to-sell-mutual-fund-arm-seeks-rs-2000cr-valuation/articleshow/58335769.cms

The group has put off its plan to list as a real estate investm,"MUMBAI: Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), one of the world’s largest asset managers, is close to buying India’s largest warehousing company Indo-Space, owned by private equity fund Everstone Group, for roughly $700 million. CPPIB will further invest up to $1.2 billion in the company, signalling the continued interest of the Canadian company in India, two persons with direct knowledge of the development said.  Everstone owns 8.5 million sq ft of industrial real estate property through IndoSpace. The group has put off its plan to list as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for which it had begun initial work last year.  “The group has decided to monetise its warehousing assets as further capital infusion would require a deep-pocketed partner,” said one of the persons aware of the matter. “They were going to bring in a minority partner to establish valuation of the business for the proposed listing, but it is now going with a complete sale.”“The two companies will sign an agreement in a fortnight,” the second person said. Even though the Union budget in 2016 removed the dividend distribution tax (DDT) on such REITs paving way for such listings, Indian firms are still evaluating its merits, experts said.  GST to Boost Investment Everstone Capital has the largest industrial real estate portfolio in India with around 8.5 million of operational and leased real estate warehousing and logistics space while another 20 million of under-construction warehouses will come to the market over the next 36 months.  The group had spent about $1.1 billion in developing these industrial real estate assets through debt and equity.  “CPPIB will invest an additional $1.2 billion in the company to develop around 40 million sq.ft. of warehouses over the next five years,” said another person with knowledge of the deal.  An Everstone spokesperson did not respond to an emailed query while a CPPIB spokesperson declined to comment on market speculation in an emailed response.  IndoSpace, a joint venture between Everstone Capital and Realterm Global, has a pan-India presence and counts top global and domestic companies such as Nissan, P&G, L’Oreal, DHL, Samsung, Kuo, Levi’s, among others, as its tenants. The company has all its assets held through separate special purpose vehicles (SPVs).  Private equity consultants say the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) would be the major driver of investments in the sector.  “Private equity firms have been keen on the logistics and the warehousing sector in recent times. The GST implementation would aid returns in the sectors since as the operational efficiency goes up, rental costs go down. It will also provide businesses the opportunity to realign their supply chain,” said Sanjeev Krishan, executive director and head, private equity transactions advisory services, PricewaterhouseCoopers India.  SUNRISE SECTOR  For CPPIB that opened its India office in 2015, real estate and infrastructure has been one of the sunrise sectors in India. Earlier this month, the fund had agreed to invest $250 million for a 30% stake in Island Star Mall Developers Pvt. Ltd, a unit of Phoenix Mills Ltd.  The fund also entered into a joint venture with Larsen and Toubro Ltd. with a commitment of Rs 2,000 crore in L&T’s infrastructure asset development subsidiary L&T Infrastructure Development Projects.  The fund has put together a consortium with global PE fund KKR to buy 10.3% stake in Bharti Infratel for $952 million. It also holds around 6.26% stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank.  The fund, that has a total of around Canadian $300 billion of assets under management, has put to use about $4 billion in India so far.  According to global consulting firm EY, the size of the Indian warehousing industry (across commodities and modes) is pegged at about Rs 56,000 crore (excluding inventory carrying costs, which amount to another Rs 4,340 00 crore). The industry is growing at over 10% annually.  According to the report, industrial and retail warehousing amounts to around 55% of the entire industry.  With the growth of e-tailing in India, the warehousing and logistics market here has seen an unprecedented surge in the past three years.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cppib-may-buy-indospace-from-everstone-group/articleshow/58335702.cms

Naik, 75, is currently the executive chairman of the engineering and construction giant and, according to company rules, he will relinquish this position by September-end.There was little clarity on whether Naik will eventually retire in September or whether he will be redesignated when his term as executive chairman nears an end. Naik had earlier said that L&T will have a chairman, but whether it would be an executive or non-executive was something that was yet to be decided.On Friday, L&T said that its board of directors felt that given Naik’s rich experience and understanding of complexities in businesses, he should continue with the organisation providing advice and guidance to the next generation of leadership in the capacity of non-executive chairman for the enterprise’s sustained growth and profitability.There is no retirement age for non-executive directors. L&T, however, said that Naik’s term will be till September 30, 2020. A Padma Bhushan awardee, Naik has been with the company for 52 years, becoming its CEO in 1999 and chairman in 2003.L&T has been restructuring leadership roles to accommodate Naik. In 2012, it split the post of chairman and managing director, allowing Naik to continue as chairman. And now it has redesignated Naik as its non-executive chairman.“A M Naik has been the soul of L&T, and has given his whole life to the organisation. We are delighted that he has agreed to continue to help the company for the next three years,” said Subodh Bhargava, chairman of L&T’s nomination and remuneration committee. The company also said on Friday that S N Subrahmanyan, 57, will take charge as its CEO and MD from July 1. Subrahmanyan, or SNS as he is called, is currently the deputy MD and president. Naik has been mentoring and grooming SNS for the last three years ever since he was identified as the former’s successor. Like Naik, SNS too is an L&T lifer. He has been with the company for 33 years, having joined as a project planning engineer in 1984.Subrahmanyan said, “Stepping into the shoes of a visionary and industry doyen like Naik is not easy. However, I have been blessed that Naik has agreed to continue as an non-executive chairman.

A company official associated with the project said that following the accident the company called in its senior security advisors and safety auditors from overseas to take stock of the situation and make necessary changes and added that safety precautions have been increased following the death of the worker.“The whole construction site is divided into four sections and every section has its own safety in-charge. We conduct a daily safety meeting before starting work. If there is any violation of rules, the security officer responsible for the site is penalized,” the official said, and added that new purchases, including that of indicators for the construction site have been made. While most workers expressed satisfaction with the improvements made after the accident, some demanded improvement in their living conditions. “Safety arrangements here are lax as compared to that of other sites where I have worked. One should see our living conditions near Old Goa where most of the workers live. There are no medical arrangements in case of an emergency. The company has kept an ambulance, but nobody knows where the driver is,” a worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, alleged, and added that sometimes workers travel in trucks instead of bus.

While all boards follow set practices of corporate governance and audits are done regularly to ensure the same are adhered to, there is a growing trend among listed as well as unlisted companies to bring in a third party to evaluate boards externally. The objective is to improve upon governance standards.An external evaluation brings in a specialist, who has experience of working with boards. More than just facilitating, it can bring an insight into the process along with industry knowledge. Suresh Raina, managing partner, Hunt-Partners, which conducts external evaluations for boards, said, “An external evaluation process conducted by a neutral agency allows highlighting directors’ concerns and acts as an early warning system to the board, which will allow changes to be implemented before more deep-rooted problems set in.”Larsen & Toubro, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Essar Oil are some of the organisations that get board evaluations done through external agencies. Jaimin Bhatt, president & group CFO, Kotak Mahindra Bank, which utilised the services of an external agency from fiscal year 2015-16, said, “Board evaluation helps improve governance standards as it measures the contribution of the board, its committees, chairman and individual directors vis-à-vis the performance of the company. It reviews the effectiveness of the board, its committees and the individual directors by assessing the balance of skills as well as helps in identifying the weaknesses and reviewing the board practices and its efficiency.”According to the India Board Report 2015, less than 10% of companies opt for external evaluation. Shailesh Haribhakti, founder & chief mentor, Baker Tilly DHC, said, “External evaluations are effective only when evaluators have very close connects with members from a wide variety of boards from all over the world. The rich global best practice sharing can be valuable. This richness can also emerge from a team of experienced board members who regularly participate in or externally consult in evaluation contexts. This is a growing trend of more effective evaluations, however sourced.”But it would be premature to state this is the only solution to ensure founders are content with the manner in which boards function. Experts said boards would still require to be proactive and act upon the findings of external evaluators. “Where the external board evaluation process has been quite successful is the World Bank and its investment arm IFC. For every company, where IFC has to make an investment decision, it is subjected to an external board evaluation process to meet the minimum requirements of corporate governance,” said Raina.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cos-rely-on-external-board-reviews-to-boost-governance/articleshow/57174543.cms

""We are confident that the Finance Minister would stick to his fiscal deficit targets for the year inspite of this hike.

There are close to a dozen PSUs that provide range of consultancy services - from education to EPC -- and there is a scope of merging some of them to create a company of global standards, a senior government official said. ""Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget for 2017-18 has spoken about mergers and consolidation in the public sector. We feel there should be one mega consultancy company providing services across portfolios,"" the official said. While EIL is the biggest state-controlled consultancy firm providing engineering consultancy and EPC services principally focused on the oil and gas and petrochemical industries, Engineering Projects (India) Ltd also provides turnkey execution of projects in the infrastructure space. Then there is MECON Ltd that provides technical consultancy and project implementation in infrastructure and services sector. In the telecom space, there is Telecommunications Consultants (India Ltd) whereas WAPCOS provides consultancy and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) for water, power and infrastructure projects. ""There is a case for merging the array of consultancy companies into Engineers India Ltd to create a mega company that will provide consultancy across the spectrum of projects,"" the official told . The new company, as and when it emerges, can take up projects across sectors and compete with the likes of Bechtel of the US and domestic majors like Larsen & Toubro (L&T).

The official said that a merged entity would have opportunities to save on costs and improve operational efficiency. It can also diversify into sectors not touched so far. The merger could reduce inefficiencies across the sector.

""We have over 1,600 engineers in the US and around 65 per cent of them are on H1-B visas. If the salaries were to be hiked, our calculations suggest an impact of 2-2.5 per cent on Ebidta margins,"" Managing Director and Chief Executive Keshab Panda told . In the face of difficulties like the new visa bill, which proposes to more than double the minimum wages for H1-B visa-holders to USD 1,30,000, Panda said the software arm of engineering major Larsen & Toubro, will either have to reduce reliance on onsite workforce in the US that accounts for 63 per cent of is revenue, or hike billing. At present, the average salary of its employees in the US is USD 75,000-80,000 while the H1-B visa holders draw USD 62,000-65,000 per annum, he said explaining the necessity to take corrective steps, he said. L&T Technology has written to 25 clients, to understand their take on how to deal with such an eventuality, if it were to come true. However, none of the customers have yet replied back and are in a wait-and-watch mode, he said. One of the options is to shift the engineers back to India which will help its customers with costs and also help expand the margin for the company, he said. He further said there is some degree of comfort which the clients share with the H1-B visa-holders, having worked together for a few years. Panda said L&T Technology may be able to renegotiate contracts with some of its clients by impressing them on the need to do so given the circumstances. He wondered whether there are enough hands in the US to work on projects if all the tech companies start vying for local talent. The evolving situation in the US and the number of engineering jobs which get relocated to India will have a bearing on its domestic hiring, he maintained. At present, the company is forging partnerships with reputed academic institutes to work on real life problems, which will also lead to absorption of some of the people into the company's workforce, Panda said. Meanwhile, the company announced setting up of an industrial Internet of Things lab, the fourth such set-up exclusively for Rockwell Automation, in Bengaluru.

""Demonetisation could have particularly profound impact on the real estate sector,"" it said in an analysis on the impact of note ban announced on November 8. On short-term effect on the sector through December-end, the Economic Survey 2016-17 said that ""prices declined, as wealth fell while cash shortages impeded transactions"".

It said that tax component could rise, especially if Goods and Services Tax, slated for roll out in July, is imposed on real estate. Much of the black money accumulated was ultimately used to evade taxes on property sales, the Survey said, adding that this type of tax evasion would diminish with curbs on unaccounted wealth and financial transactions taking place increasingly through electronic means. While too early to assess whether there will be permanent effects, the Survey said, the weighted average price of real estate in eight major cities, which was already on a declining trend fell further after November 8, 2016.

The industrial giant had clocked a net profit of Rs 700.34 crore for October-December last fiscal. The infrastructure conglomerate's total income from operations rose to Rs 26,286.98 crore during the quarter under review, from Rs 25,928.07 crore a year ago. Its expenses during the quarter were slightly up at Rs 24,486.57 crore as against Rs 24,170 crore in the previous fiscal. In its outlook, the company said the domestic growth appears to take longer time as investment momentum remains weak and the banking system is burdened by debt overhang. On recent demonetisation, the infrastructure major said, ""Government's initiatives to curb the parallel economy and make a transition to cashless economy have caused disruption whose impact on the business sentiment is yet to be conclusively assessed."" It said the challenging business conditions are expected to continue in the next few quarters until the government moves to lift growth through ""infra spend and tax reforms take effect"". About global economic scenario, it said the revival hinges on the outcome of post Brexit events in the UK, change in the economic policy stance in the US, political developments in some of the major European countries and China's policy response to slowdown. ""Recovery of commodity prices and oil price uptick have provided a positive twist to the global economic revival predictions,"" it noted. The company focus will be on ""selective pursuit of opportunities, working capital reduction, cost optimisation through supply chain efficiencies and productivity enhancement through digitisation initiatives"". ""Aided by these initiatives, the company is hopeful of a satisfactory performance, given the current business environment,"" it said.

This is what Dilip Shanghvi, chairman and managing director of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited said here while addressing the gathering of students, parents and officials of MS University during the 65th annual convocation ceremony.Shanghvi, who along with Anil Naik, group executive chairman of Larsen & Toubro Limited, was conferred the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (Dsc) by MSU, said there are enormous opportunities coming in way of graduating students.“From $1 trillion economy, in slightly more than ten years, India is currently a $2 trillion economy and in next 10 years, it will become a $4 trillion economy. We are witnessing rapid growth and opportunities available to all are enormous,” he said. “In last 20 years, we have added knowledge which is equivalent to the knowledge that we had added in previous 2,000 years,” said Shanghvi, who admitted of having no knowledge of pharmacy before plunging into pharmaceutical business. “I had never studied science. Instead I had studied BCom. I did not have any understanding of pharmacology, drugs, disease or business but life is a process of constant learning,” said Shanghvi who has been recently appointed as chairman of board of governors of IIT Bombay.Naik, who has served as chairman of IIM-A, while delivering his acceptance speech inspired the graduating students to passionately purse the quest of knowledge and never forget their roots, past teachers and parents. Both Lord professor Bhikhu Parekh, who was the guest of honour and Dr Vijay Bhatkar, who was the chief guest at the convocation ceremony, urged MSU not to be content with ‘A’ grade given by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) on Friday. “I often wondered why MSU has been ranked B by NAAC. But it is rightful that MSU has now bagged A rank. We must start working on achieving A+ and A++ grade. The quest must go on,” said Bhatkar, MSU’s eminent alumni who is well known as father of India’s first supercomputer – PARAM. Lord Bhikhu Parekh asked the university authorities to work towards achieving ‘A+’ grade. The eminent political theorist, who is member of UK’s House of Lords, also urged the graduating students to work for the underprivileged sections of the society. “We have elected representatives who are holding country to ransom. Teachers are concentrating on tuition classes. Professional morality is on decline. Whether it is Modi or Mahatma, no messiah can build a nation in such a situation. Gandhiji had once said ‘be the change you want to see’. And it is upon us to bring that change,” he said. A total of 155 gold medalists were conferred 259 gold medals during the convocation.

Once ready, the project promises to cut point-to-point travel time by as much as twothirds compared to now.Confirming the date for its rollout, the managing director of Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL), NVS Reddy , says it will be operational by Ugadi, that falls on March 29, 2017. “We are ready to launch two stretches of two different corridors,“ he says. In case of another delay , Telangana Formation Day (June 2) is also being considered as a second possible date for the commissioning.Reddy says the confirmation of dates is now possible since a long-standing dispute between HMRL and South Central Railway (SCR) has been resolved.The two organisations were at loggerheads over the construction of tracks passing on top of rail overbridges (RoBs) at eight places in the city . Initially, SCR had not permitted Larsen & Toubro (L&T), the concessionaire for the project, to build the tracks.But SCR has now conceded against a compensation of `1 crore for each track over an RoB.The original date for completing the entire project was June 2017, but it faced several hurdles.Now, chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao has set Au gust 2018 as the deadline for the three-corridor project. In all, 57 trains will be operated when the project is ready . Each train will have three coaches. The rolling stock has been imported from South Korea.The `14,132-crore infrastructure project is being built with a viability gap funding of 10% by the Centre. For now, the two stretches being readied are: an eight-km stretch on Corridor 3, between Nagole and Mettugu da; a 12-km stretch between Miyapur and Sanjeeva Reddy Nagar on Corridor 1. While the former is part of the 28.87-km stretch between Nagole and Raidurg, the latter is a portion of the 29-km line planned between LB Nagar and Miyapur.According to an official, tracks and rakes for both stretches are ready. Work has picked up pace to complete the construction of tracks and stations from Mettuguda to Begumpet and from Sanjeeva Reddy Nagar to Panjagutta.“Since it is a huge project, some work might also spill into 2018.The aim is to complete the entire project by the end of 2017,“ Reddy says.On how the Metro would make life easier, an official said, life easier, an official s “A journey by road that now takes two-and-a-half hours can be covered in 41 minutes once the Metro starts functioning.“IMPORTED BICYCLES AT METRO STATIONSTo enable an easy commute to and from the 66 metro stations, a fleet of top-end automatic bicycles will be imported from Germany. The HMRL depot at Nagole has already got 20 bicycles as part of the initiative.Officials say 132 bicycle stands will be developed on either side of Metro stations to ensure that commuters do not need to cross the road. No staff will man these bike stations, says D V Manohar, chairman, Hyderabad Cycling Club, which will provide 10,000 bicycles.“All you need to do is flash your mobile phone or swipe at a bike station to use a bicycle“. The club will also introduce 100 e-bikes (powered by electricity). It intends to give people cycling lessons as well. Manohar says, “The authorities in Manhattan too had introduced bicycles because there it had become difficult to drive amid traffic.“ About the health benefits of the move, he says, “It will stop Hyderabad from becoming a gas chamber by reducing pollution and will also make people fitter.“",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/metro-gathers-pace-may-roll-out-by-march/articleshow/55932445.cms

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has proposed a link road from Road No 45, Jubilee Hills, to Khajaguda Junction to ease traffic on the stretch from Road No 36, Jubilee Hills, till Cyber Towers Junction.Official sources said traffic studies conducted by different agencies have shown that Road No 36, Jubilee Hills, to Cyber Towers Junction requires 12 road lanes to withstand the current volume of traffic. According to estimates, 35,000 vehicles pass through this road every hour.The road is choked during peak hours and work on Corridor III of the Metro Rail has further contributed to the chaos. As part of the link road, the GHMC has planned to construct a 1.58-km six-lane elevated flyover from Road No 45 Junction up to the Durgam Cheruvu suspension bridge which will require the current road to be widened to 120 feet from 100 feet.From here, the road will head towards Inorbit Mall and further to Khajaguda. This 3.6-km stretch will also need to be widened to 150 feet for taking the expected traffic volume. Once the commuters reach Khajaguda, people can take Outer Ring Road at Nanakramguda, Gachibowli, after travelling another 3 km, officials said.The state government has already okayed a suspension bridge across Durgam Cheruvu which is being constructed at a cost of Rs 184 crore by Larsen & Toubro Limited. The bridge is expected to be ready in two years. “A detailed survey was done for the road expansion project.The proposed link road with an elevated flyover not only reduces the traffic on Hi-Tec City road but also reduces the distance by four to five km as well as travel time.

The $16-billion diversified conglomerate said on Tuesday the step was an attempt to “right size” its strength in the face of business slowdown. Digitisation of operations also caused redundancies that led to downsizing.  “The company has taken a lot of initiative to right size staffing in various businesses. The digitisation and productivity enhancement initiatives taken by us boiled down to redundancies of roles and we have been able to shed as a group 14,000 in the six months to September,” Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman said.  L&T expects the economic environment to remain challenging in coming months though a pickup in government orders is making up for private sector slack.  Raman said that retrenchment exercise is a “correction”.  The CFO said that the move should not be viewed as a sequential event. L&T has been facing challenges with customers deferring orders and falling oil prices contributing to a sharp slowdown in the Middle-east, one of its biggest bets. Competition has increased in domestic market as companies fight for a shrinking order book pie. It also incurred losses due to inability to pass on cost escalation and other issues. In the first half of FY17, its revenue increased 8.6% to Rs 46,885 crore. Profits rose to Rs 2,044 crore from Rs 1,197 crore a year ago.  In April, ET was the first to report that L&T Finance Holding, the nonbanking finance company of the engineering major Larsen & Toubro, had asked over 550 employees to quit due to high costs and a muted business environment. In July, ET followed it up with another story detailing L&T Infotech’s high attrition rate of 18%.  “If we believe that some business will take some time to get back to normalcy, it is important that we reduce under-recoveries. We are redefining roles and jobs which are redundant, we are allowing people to move on. It is across businesses,” Raman said.  He did not give details of the number of people sacked in different businesses. “Financial services has defocused on certain lines of businesses and has let go a lot of people. Same is the case in minerals and metals,” Raman said.  L&T launched a five-year strategic plan this year aiming to scale up revenue to Rs 2 lakh crore. The plan identifies some non-performing businesses that have been put under scanner and call on them will be taken in 18-24 months.

Defence minister Manohar Parrikar had recently blamed activists for putting a spanner in the works, but officials indicated that safety checks were the reason for the delay in laying the bridge segments.  “Most of the major erection work of the launching girder is complete. The girder will now be subjected to stringent safety tests. Once the tests are positively concluded, launching of segments will start. We would like the contractor to be safe than sorry,” GSIDC managing director Sanjit Rodrigues told STOI.  A source closely associated with the project suggested that the December 2017 deadline was much more plausible than the May 2017 target, which had been issued with an eye on the state assembly election.  When asked to comment on the deadline for the third Mandovi bridge that is being built by Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T), Rodrigues said his focus remained on safety.  “The segments will go up soon and I think that if there is a spillover where time is concerned, it will be minor. I will not foul the contractor or my engineers for this. To be fair to the contractor and the project, we will not want to hurry installation of the segments,” Rodrigues said.  While the GSIDC MD admitted that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had asked the corporation and L&T to comply with CRZ norms, he did not appear too perturbed about the issue.  But he lamented that GSIDC’s efforts to reduce the inconvenience to motorists were not being appreciated.  “Working with traffic moving on both sides has not been easy. What has to be appreciated is that with heavy traffic on both the bridges, we have managed to deliver the piers of the bridge. We have confined work to a small space,” he added.

Of the total stake sold, about 56.6 lakh shares were bought by SBI for Rs 800 crore, disclosures on the two stock exchanges showed. The government stakes were held in Administrator of the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), which came to it about 15 years ago post the reorganisation of the former UTI. Funds mobilised through this stake sale will help meet the government’s target to garner finances through divestments in various PSUs and strategic holdings. In the budget in February, the government had set a Rs 56,500-crore divestment target. After years of deliberations, the government had finally decided to offload up to 3% stake in L&T for nearly Rs 4,000 crore through block deals. Post this sale, SUUTI will still hold about 6.7% in L&T, worth around Rs 8,700 crore.As a result of Friday’s stake sale, which increased the supply of L&T shares in the market, the stock of the company closed 1.8% down at Rs 1,419. Citibank’s securities arm, ICICI Securities and Morgan Stanley managed the L&T deal on behalf of the government.In addition to L&T, the government, through SUUTI, also holds stakes in ITC and Axis Bank. Together with L&T, the aggregate value of these stakes is nearly Rs 54,000 crore.

Pointing out that the project was first conceived two years ago and was also part of the 2014-15 budget, George said the government is committed to preserving the city's ecology.In an interview with The Times of India on Sunday, George reiterated that rumours about possible kickbacks of Rs 400-600 crore are just that. ""I urge them to come up with evidence before an appropriate forum. As far as the heritage buildings go, the project will not touch any part of the structures. We just want the compound walls to move inside by a few feet,"" he said.Excerpts:Q: Why is the government appearing to rush with the proposed steel flyover project, bypassing public consultation and other processes?A: We are not rushing. This project was not conceived now for us to be rushing. It was part of the chief minister's budget speech in 2014 and we are already late in implementing it. Also, we are open to all suggestions and criticism, but the government must take a decision as this is for the development of the city. When the project was first proposed, none of these activists or people questioned it. Now that the matter is in the final stages, they are all here, and you must ask who is motivating them. I have respect for the judiciary and the government will do as the court orders, but I think there are also attempts to influence the court through articles.Q: There is speculation about kickbacks of around Rs 400 crore that's pushing the project...There is also speculation about Scindia Steels, a firm you own stakes in..?A: These are all rumours and speculation, the truth is the city needs this flyover and the government is only doing what is best for Bengaluru. If anybody has any evidence about the kickbacks, I urge them to bring it before an appropriate forum. As far as the steel company goes, I have no controlling stake in the firm. And, as far as my knowledge goes, the firm has no tie-up with L&T (which will implement the steel bridge), I can even verify that and get back.Q: When the project was conceived in 2014, the estimated cost was Rs 1,100 crore, now it will cost the government Rs 1,700 crore.A: When the project was conceived, the DPR (detailed project report) was not ready and the cost was only an estimate. You must also understand that the revised cost includes not only the escalation over two years, but also 10% VAT, which was not calculated in 2014. Q: Should the city, already breathing bad air, sacrifice 800 trees? While the government promises to plant saplings elsewhere, there have been instances of such promises not being fulfilled in the past.A: The government is committed to preserving the ecology. We cannot generalize that saplings will not be planted. If there are old issues where such a thing has happened, I will ask the BDA or concerned agency to look into the matter and plant the trees. As for this project, we will be planting at least 10 trees for every tree we lose, which is also in line with the law.Q: What about the heritage buildings?A: There is a misconception created in the minds of the people that we are going to alter the structure of the heritage buildings (Carlton House and Balabrooie Guest House). That is false. All we need for the project is the compound walls to be moved inside by a few feet. It will not harm the buildings as such.

Infrastructure Company Jaypee Group will carry out the work at the two places.“The idea is to study merits of white topping of roads and the quality of work a company can provide.Equipment will arrive on Thursday following which the work will start,“ said Rammohan.He said the government had decided to restrict giving contracts to reputed companies such as Jaypee Group and Larsen&Toubro.“Substandard quality of work carried out by various contractors is a cause of concern. As a remedy the government has decided to consider only reputed companies, which have sense of responsibility and reputation,“ said the mayor.The decision was taken in a review meeting convened by municipal administration and urban development minister K T Rama Rao on Wednesday . Responding to questions on the state of city roads and other infrastructure, KTR said a comprehensive plan was being prepared to improve civic infrastructure.While the cost of execution of the plan is estimated to be Rs 25,000 crore, a major portion of funding is being planned through borrowings from the open market. Ramohan said SBI Capital had come forward to lend Rs 20,000 crore.“As a report on the losses caused by the recent rains has been sent to the Centre, and we sought Rs 2,200 crore as compensation, we expect a substantial amount of money from the Union government,“ said Ramohan.He said the state government had decided to release Rs 400 crore immediately with which the work could be started.Apart from carrying out road work and repairing the drainage system, the government is also mulling major changes even in the structure of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). KTR said the government had decided to do away with the major roads division in the GHMC and decisions regarding work would be taken at the circle level.To bring in effective decentralisation in planning and execution of works, the number of circles in GHMC will be increased from existing 24 to 30, the minister said.He said the government was planning to bring in a legislation to bring all municipalities under a single umbrella. “We are preparing a law that will enable transfer of employees from one civic body to another, something which is not possible under the existing system. This will curb corruption to a great extent,“ the minister said.Reviewing the exercise of clearing encroachments, KTR is also learnt to have asked GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy to submit a detailed report of illegal structures built on nalas along with their pictures.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/white-topping-to-give-hyderabad-roads-a-facelift/articleshow/54706882.cms

It set aside the order issued by Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court in favour of joint venture (JV) between Tata Projects Limited (TPL) and Guangdong Yuantian Engineering Company (GYT). The SC decided on the case within one month preventing further delay in the project.  The work on Sitabuldi-Hingna depot section of Metro rail was slated to begin in April but got stuck due to litigation between Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited (NMRCL) and the JV. The litigation started when NMRCL rejected the technical bid of JV. According to NMRCL, the Tata-led JV had experience in construction of high speed rail but not Metro rail.  The JV challenged the decision in Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, which directed the NMRCL to open its financial bid too. One of the bidders, Afcons, then challenged this order in Supreme Court in the role of an intervener. The SC first granted a status quo on August 22 but decided in favour of NMRCL and Afcons on Thursday.  A NMRCL official said that five companies had bid for the work — Larsen & Toubro, Nagarjuna Construction Company (NCC), Afcons, ITD and the Tata-led JV. “Now we will evaluate the bids of the first four companies. This process will be completed as early as possible and work order will be issued,” he added.  The length of the Sitabuldi-Hingna section is about 9 km. The estimated cost of the construction is about 440 crore. The geotechnical survey of this section had been done months ago.  Meanwhile, the work on Mihan-Sitabuldi stretch of the Metro is going on at a fast pace. NMRCL has so far erected 12 pillars and is in the process of erecting another 35. NMRCL has also launched two horizontal spans. Construction of two stations on this stretch has also started. Work has also started on construction of eight pillars near the main railway station.  The agency has also sent tender for Sitabuldi-Wardhaman Nagar stretch to its prime lender KfW, a German financial institution, for vetting. Once it is cleared, the tender will be floated.

Naik, who was here to interact with media about the upcoming IPO of L&T Technology Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of engineering giant Larsen & Toubro, assured the investors of L&T Infotech that the company's shares would start trading in premium within one year. He also blamed major IT companies for ""not providing good guidance"" on the Sensex. ""I must tell you that unfortunately many companies gave a not so very good guidance in the IT industry. The entire IT Index has gone down, while the general Index (Sensex) went up because the guidance was not so encouraging from major IT companies, which had an impact on IT industry as a whole. And unfortunately, we caught in to it,"" Naik told reporters. In a tepid debut two months back, L&T Infotech listed 6 per cent below its listing price of Rs 710. It closed up 1 per cent yesterday at Rs 652.10 on the BSE against a Sensex rally of over 1.6 per cent. ""We are now focusing on building and repositioning this company to be a very premium, new technology oriented, such as big data and cloud computing. Within one year, you (investors) will have no regret,"" said Naik. Commenting about the share price of L&T Infotech, which is trading in discount, Naik said that the slump in IT Index happened only after their IPO was launched. ""IT industry is not in the best of its time now and this happened after we launched the IPO (in July). Otherwise, we may have not launched it, as we are concerned about our reputation."" ""As we have taken this matter seriously, we are now repositioning our company towards new age technologies. I am confident that in one year, we will start trading in premium,"" said Naik. He also announced that the company has signed an agreement with another firm for introducing a new software platform. ""We will be making an important announcement in couple of weeks time where we have signed (an agreement) with a major company on a new software platform which will focus only on manufacturing. We are positioned higher than the rest because we are a strong manufacturing company. This will going to make a difference,"" said Naik. ""Whether it is geographical spread, or technological innovations or partnering for new-age products, I think we are firing all cylinders. Hopefully, it will bring results,"" he added.

In my case, giving has continued for three generations. My grandfather and father did not have money so they lived their lives for poor people,” Naik told ETin an interview. “I have committed to use 75% of my income for charitable purposes.”  He’s set up two charitable trusts — the Naik Charitable Trust for education and skill training and the Nirali Memorial Medical Trust, named after his grand daughter who died of cancer in 2007. Naik declined to give details of the amount spent so far and the money he will be directing to philanthropy going ahead.  According to the ET Intelligence Group, Naik took home nearly Rs 200 crore in compensation in 2010-16. In FY16, this included stock options awarded by L&T Infotech. According to a source aware of the matter, since 1995, when Naik made his first donation to a hospital in his native village in Gujarat, he has donated about Rs 125 crore to charitable initiatives.  An asset management company handles Naik’s money while his sister’s family assists him in philanthropy. Naik is currently engaged in building a school and hospital close to L&T’s Powai campus and is also keen on setting up a fire station there. “I want to carry out my charity work at my ‘janmabhoomi’ and my ‘karmabhoomi’,” Naik said.  Naik became the chief executive in 1999 and chairman in 2003.  His long stewardship ushered in rapid growth and diversification at Larsen & Toubro, transforming it into a global engineering conglomerate. His trusts run seven projects and two of these will be commissioned in 2017, one of them being a Vedic school named after his wife that will be inaugurated on her birthday.  Naik recounted how his father asked him to explain where he got Rs 4 lakh to donate to a hospital in his village in 1995 to add a floor. “He was such a principled man that he wanted to know the source of every penny,” he said. “I had to show him my passbooks! I started charity when I did not have much money.”  Naik said both his children are living overseas. “My son is with Google and my daughter has a medical practice,” he said. “Both of them are well settled in the US, and it is unlikely that they will return to settle down in India. As a father, I will always continue to hope that they will return to live in India.”  The succession plan seems to be moving seamlessly forward with SN Subrahmanyan, deputy managing director, seen as succeeding Naik when he retires in September 2017.  There have been hints that Naik may continue as non-executive chairman to guide the company, just as he plans to guide his charitable ventures.

According to the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee, Naik awarded a contract to recable 11kv high tension and low tension electricity lines to Larsen & Toubro (L&T), even though two other companies had submitted lower bids. ""Milind Naik is in a hurry. The elections are near and a lot of money is required. Once the code of conduct comes, no file will move. He is rigging tenders for his benefit,"" GPCC spokesperson Sunil Kawthankar said on Wednesday.  The electricity department had floated a tender worth 157 crore for electrical works in high tension and low tension distribution networks on January29 and six companies bid for the contract. The six participating companies included Voltas Limited, KEI Industries and Larsen & Toubro.  ""At the time of the techo-feasibility evaluation on March 23, the financial bids of all three bidders were visible, which should have resulted in scrapping the tender,"" said Kawthankar.  Though Voltas Limited and KEI Industries emerged as the lowest bidders, the contract was awarded to L&T while Voltas Electric was disqualified when the financial bids were opened on April 22. ""Voltas refused to pay kickbacks so it was disqualified and KEI was promised that it would receive another contract if it did not make any noise,"" Kawthankar alleged.  Congress has alleged that Naik is receiving kickbacks and wrote to the chief minister and the chief secretary on May 24 alleging irregularities in the tender process. A meeting of the Goa State Works Board was held on June 21 with the power secretary Kunal present and where the decision was taken to retender the entire contract.  On August 6, Naik wrote a note overruling Goa State Works Board's decision and awarded the contract to L&T. On August 17, Naik awarded a contract to KEI Industries to supply aerial bunched cables and 20,000 RCC electrical poles, the Congress said.  Kawthankar said, ""The taxpayer's money is being spent to fill BJP election coffers. KEI were awarded the 145 crore tender which was tailor-made to suit them. They were also given the order of electrical poles, violating orders of the government as supply of RCC poles is the scope of the Goa Handicrafts Rural and Small Scale Industries Development Corporation (GHRSSIDC).""  ""We will approach the Lokayukta with this case and demand a vigilance inquiry be initiated within 24 hours,"" claimed Kawthankar.

Stee","New Delhi, Aug 5 () India's largest steel producer, SAIL, today came in the cross-hairs of government auditor CAG for its declining market share. Steel consumption in India rose 30 per cent in 2009-15, but state-run SAIL's market share in total saleable finished steel fell to 14.2 per cent from 18.5 per cent during the same period, it said in its report. ""This was not only due to the delays in capacity addition projects, but also due to absence of an active dealership base, which adversely impacted the growth in retail sales,"" the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) revealed. It added that 39-54 per cent of the authorised retail dealers (ARDs) of the Maharatna firm are ""inactive"". ""There was no physical verification of ARDs' activities by branch offices. Sales through MoUs with large institutional consumers accounted for 92 per cent of the company's total sales in 2014-15 and developing customer base in retail sector was accorded lower priority,"" the CAG report said. SAIL was not ""successful"" in about 30 per cent of the tenders during the 3-year period from 2012 to 2015, mostly due to ""higher bids"", it added. ""The company did not analyse the reasons for losing the business in tenders and took no steps to formulate a future course of action,"" the auditor added. ""Extension of credit period to Tirupati Group resulted in undue benefits of Rs 3.98 crore. Interest of Rs 18.81 crore was not recovered from Larsen & Toubro Ltd."" Inadequate supervision over conversion agencies resulted in ""instances of misuse"" of the company's supplies and SAIL brand name by conversion agents (CA) and wet leasing agents (WLAs). The firm could not recover Rs 8.52 crore from a WLA in Visakhapatnam, it was found out. The CAG recommended that SAIL should ""expand its customer base in the retail sector and strengthen periodical supervision of activities of ARDs"". It also suggested an analysis of the causes of failure in securing orders through tenders and outcome of such activities may be used while formulating future action plans.

He alleged the Madhya Pradesh Power Generating Company Ltd (MPPGCL) shut down the functional first phase of SSTPS having an installed capacity of 1200 Mega Watt five months ago due to costly coal needed to run it. The first phase of SSTPS was commissioned with a cost of Rs 8,000 crore in 2014, the AAP leader said.

The AAP leader also alleged that despite objections of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), the project of setting up the second phase was given to L&T at a high rate.

The government was also forced to drop the proposal after it failed to obtain loan from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco). The state government technically does not own the land as the land pooling process is yet to be completed. The government will get hold of the documents only after the farmers register the land parcels in favour of the state.The AP government had some time ago announced that two more floors will be added to the interim government complex comprising six blocks to accommodate the offices of all heads of departments. But, the plan was dropped abruptly without citing any valid reason. Many departments were asked to scout for private buildings in Vijayawada, Guntur and surrounding areas.According to sources, the contractor had quoted higher price for the additional two floors. The original estimate for the ground plus one floor was Rs 210 crore. Though the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) offered 10 percent extra on the original estimates, the contractor is said to have turned down the proposal.At this juncture, the CRDA thought of calling fresh tenders inviting other companies, but dropped the idea. Sources said the CRDA does not want to invite any trouble as the original estimates of Rs 210 crore for two floors is itself excess. The L&T reportedly demanded provision for 'fast track allowance' as the work is being completed at a faster rate.Initially, the government announced that HUDCO loan of around Rs 500 core will be obtained for the six floors, but the loan process got delayed as the AP government did not enjoy the ownership rights on the pooled land.

Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) has asked Larsen & Toubro, which constructed the cable-stayed bridge, to undertake the major rectification of the approach ramps as the defects cropped up during the liability period.  The ramps on either side had begun to show signs of asymmetry causing vehicles to experience jerks while approaching the bridge. It must be noted that the bridge was inaugurated on January 27, 2019, by the former chief minister Manohar Parrikar. Since the defects cropped up during the liability period, L&T will have to bear the cost for the rectification and repairs, a government officer said. The Merces-Porvorim ramp on the southern end of the bridge tends to get waterlogged during the monsoon due to heavy rainfall and also it being a part of the reclaimed land.

The deal was announced on Wednesday in Mumbai.  The mall, which includes the Hyatt luxury hotel and office premises has over 1.5 million sq ft of retail space and is the largest in northern India excluding NCR. The retail space hosts major brands along with a mix of hypermarket, departmental stores, sports bar, bowling alley and an eight-screen multiplex. Spread over 20 acres, the mall is the only one in the region that has nearly full occupancy.  TOI had reported on Thursday that drugmaker Abbott India bought office space in Godrej BKC in the Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai for Rs 1,479 crore making it one of the biggest realty deals ever. The Elante handover trumps it by more than Rs 300 crore. Though the biggest ever real estate deal in India was reported last year when Unitech had sold its share in a string of IT parks for over Rs 2,000 crore. This included six properties spread across India.

There is, however, no word on when will the Carnival Group be taking over the property. The process of completing the deal and actual transfer can take months for a property of this size.  The deal has surprised many given the slump in the real estate market in Chandigarh, which has seen prices fall by as much as 40% in some areas. Many observers feel that this deal could bring prime properties in tier II and III cities in the region in focus.  News reports put the total investment made by L&T in the project at Rs 1,500 crore so far. It was the only mall in India that the construction major was operating itself.

The City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) on Friday will open financial bid to finalize the contract to carry out system work, which includes laying of tracks, signalling and telecommunication.  Cidco Chief public relations officer Mohan Ninawe said, ""Of the six bidders, three companies qualified for the technical bid. On Friday, the financial bid will be opened, after which the lowest bidder will be awarded the electrical and mechanical work.""  According to Cidco officials, three companies - Larsen & Toubro, Ansaldo and Alstom qualified for the technical bid. ""The work is being done in four stages - viaduct, station building development, construction of depot and finally, the system work,"" the official added.  Earlier, Cidco was set to open tenders for electrical and mechanical work for the 11-km CBD Belapur-Pendhar Metro in October. But due to technical glitches, the agency lost nearly three months, thus resulting in further delay. Though 55% of the first phase work is completed, due to delay in finalizing the tenders and other issues, Cidco has now set 2015 as the new deadline for rolling out services in the satellite city. The Rs 2,000 crore project undertaken by the town planning body is being built on a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) basis.  Navi Mumbai's first metro railway project was inaugurated by chief minister Prithviraj Chavanin May 2011. The CM then had instructed the town planning authority to complete the project within three years, before 2014.  In first phase the metro network will connect from Belapur to Pendhar. The CIDCO plans to build similar network of 106 Km across the satellite city in phases, including the plan to provide connectivity to the Navi Mumbai airport ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/financial-bid-for-metro-works-opens-today/articleshow/29269567.cms

According to officials in the department of municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD), L&T, in its report submitted last month, has said the realignment proposed by the government to bypass Sultan Bazar was commercially unviable for the company which is building the project on public-private-partnership (PPP) mode.  A senior MA&UD official said L&T had sought huge monetary compensation for the diversion near Sultan Bazar as the company felt the new alignment would result in revenue loss on both, traffic and commercial development fronts. He said while the compensation amount was yet to be worked out, with the unofficial figure hovering around Rs. 2,000 crore, L&T has sought a negotiation with the government.  In the original alignment, two stations were to come up to serve the Sultan Bazar area while the proposed realignment will not have any station.  “Expressing its willingness to change the alignment near the assembly building, L&T gave two options for the new line. As regard to the change near Sultan Bazar, the company has not yet given any option, except a report on technical and commercial viability,” said M G Gopal, principal secretary, MA&UD.  “While there are no hurdles for the new alignment near the assembly building, there are certain issues related to commercial aspects in regard to the proposed realignment near Sultan Bazar. We will sit with L&T officials to discuss the issue,” Gopal added.  Of three alignment changes proposed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, L&T has responded to two in the report and maintained silence on the proposed diversion in the Old City.  While it was expected that L&T would seek extra land as compensation in order to recoup the ‘revenue loss’, the company is insisting on monetary compensation, sources said.  “L&T could have claimed land for commercial development that would offset the estimated revenue loss from realignment at Sultan Bazar. However, given the downturn in the real estate market, the company preferred monetary compensation which would be difficult for the government to comply with,” MA&UD officials said.  While e-mail queries to L&T spokesperson remained unanswered, an official in the company said, “the original alignment was in accordance with the detailed project report (DPR) prepared by the government after a careful study of the commercial viability. If plans have to be changed now, then their viability needs to be reassessed.”  “Compensation in the form of extra land does not make sense in prevailing market scenario,” he added.  The government’s position is likely to be further tightened with the traders of Sultan Bazar opposing, both the originally planned alignment and the change proposed by the CM.  “The original alignment results in demolition of over 300 shops in the market area, while the alignment proposed by the CM will see at least 125 shops demolished. We have suggested an alternative line, and we urge the government to stick to it,” said Govind Rathi, president of Traders’ Joint Action Committee which represents the traders of the area, including Sultan Bazar, Badi Chowdi, and Putli Bowli.  He said the traders would meet the CM on Friday to present their case.  Times View  Despite the issue being viewed as one between the state and L&T, it is time for the government to take the initiative and invite traders for discussions and find a solution. This way, the government and the project consessionaire can avoid cost and time overruns, and get the new transportation system up and running.

LT,2013-10-25T14:48:00+05:30,ET Bureau,L&T stock rose 19% in one month; has it managed to buck the downturn?,India Business News: The relatively low level of big-ticket investment projects means capital goods companies will have to struggle for orders and margins and profitabilit,"MUMBAI: Shares of Larsen & Toubro have risen 19% in the past one month compared with a 15% drop in the past one year. It is the only major engineering and capital goods stock to post such gains and its September quarter results surprised the Street, given the magnitude of the economic slowdown and drought of orders for capital goods companies.  How did L&T achieve this? Can it be called the beginning of a turnaround for the beleaguered engineering and capital goods sector and for L&T in particular? The answer is both yes and no. It is not the beginning of a turnaround as the economic slump may probably worsen in the coming months due to government expenditure compression.  The relatively low level of big-ticket investment projects means capital goods companies will have to struggle for orders and margins and profitability may continue to fall.  But L&T has staged a smart comeback of sorts. There is no denying that. Order inflows have been strong and margins have improved in some key business segments though overall EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortization) margins have fallen.  This was achieved through international expansion. L&T sought and won businesses in key markets like the Middle-east and Africa and this helped the order book rise and improved prospects of higher revenue growth in the coming quarters. International orders generally fetch lower margins than domestic the market but with growth a priority, some sacrifices are probably inevitable.  The share of international orders in the order has now increased to 29% now from about 5% in 2009/10. At 1.76 lakh crore, the order book is now bigger than ever for L&T and that is an important point to remember when the boom times return. At the end of the September quarter last year, the order book was 1.58 lakh crore.  L&T's revenue growth in FY13 was relatively better at 14.5% year-on-year while first half revenue in 2013/14 rose 7.6%. The second half is expected to be better and any turnaround induced by the 2014 May elections could improve only business prospects.  The second major decision to improve prospects is to diversify into different segments in the domestic markets and reduce the focus on the power sector, which at one point, dominated business growth. Today, L&T sells to infrastructure, hydrocarbon, power, handles metallurgical and material handling, does heavy engineering, electrical & automation and machinery and industrial products.  The share of new orders from infrastructure segment increased from 63% in FY13 to 71% in the first half of FY14 while those from the power sector fell to 2% from about 9%.

Such has been its failure rate that the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has been forced to impose a penalty of Rs 1 crore on the operators, Larsen & Toubro and Scomi Engineering (LTSE).  Because of its malperformance, questions on the value of the almost Rs 3,000 crore project have gathered steam among citizens.  Metropolitan commissioner UPS Madan said, “We have taken a series of steps to improve performance. There were zero cancellations last month.”  If Sunday’s failure is because of cable failure, this is the second time that services have been disrupted for this reason. In July, because of damage to the power supply cable, four trains got stuck on their path, resulting in a cancellation of services over two consecutive days.  An MMRDA official said, “We have asked L&T to restore the faulty transformers.” Commuters are not happy. Anand Bhatia, a Chembur resident, said, “They should have ensured a glitch-free ride at least six months after services were introduced.”  Ramesh Singh, a commuter at Wadala Depot, said, “I had come for a joy ride with my family.

It is also building 1,200-MW Shree Singaji thermal power plant at Malwa in Madhya Pradesh and a 1,320-MW project near Tanda in Uttar Pradesh.  He said the company will be cautiously bidding for these projects as it already has three major power projects to be executed over the next two to three years.

In an exclusive interview with TOI, he talks about the new government, defence opportunities and the future of L&T. Excerpts:  How would you rate the performance of the Narendra Modi-led government over the last nine months?  The high-voltage election campaign raised expectations of people. Normally, such questions would not have been asked if the Congress had come back to power. We are talking about 6.4% growth (previous GDP calculations) in 2015-16 and we are not that excited. The government’s vision, direction and strategy are right. I have always said give him another six months as it takes time for all policies to percolate down. The ‘Make in India’ campaign should have been done 20 years ago. Almost everything got imported from China, due to which hundreds of small companies died. Thanks to the policy of importing everything (earlier) we lose Rs 500 crore per year.  Given the problems of doing business in India, what are some of the things you would like the government to address?  The mother of all industries is infrastructure. Even for the service sector to grow, you need a world-class airport. China has built a world-class infrastructure, while we are at least 25 years behind. Steel production has slowed down with lots of imports taking place. At least 20-30 million tonnes of production got stuck. India must be export hub for four-wheelers and two-wheelers.  How big is defence in L&T’s scheme of things?   Defence is now 2% of L&T and we want to take it to 10% in the next five-seven years. There are six submarines which were supposed to have been ordered in 2000.  What does the order book position look like?  Project business is going on. Infrastructure business in India is slow, so we went ahead and got orders worth $7 billion in the Middle East. So, even in the worst of times, our order book improved — 18-20% each year while that of everybody else went down. Right now, our order book is close to Rs 2 lakh crore. But I need Rs 2.5 lakh crore as I grow.   ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/modis-vision-right-give-him-6-more-mths/articleshow/46375959.cms

Naik, who finishes a staggering 50 years of service at L&T in March 2015, refused to divulge who these executives are but talk within the company suggests that one potential successor could be S N Subrahmanyan.  Subrahmanyan currently looks after a bulk of the critical divisions of the company’s business, which includes building and factories (airport, IT, health, leisure, hospitals, real estate), heavy civil infrastructure (metro, defence, hydel, ports, nuclear), transport infrastructure (roads and runways, railways), power transmission and distribution, and water and renewable energy.  Naik, however, feels taking names would not be fair at this stage. “I have a couple of years to go and I am grooming two candidates internally to take charge after me. It is difficult to find manpower for the type of businesses we are in. So, we are also getting some from outside to head a few of our businesses,” Naik told TOI in an interview. That perhaps puts to rest any speculation of outsiders being considered for the top job at L&T after Naik.  Naik also wants to restructure the Rs 56,600-crore behemoth and its companies into a handful of more manageable verticals, to be headed by a CEO each. They could be listed separately like L&T Finance, and L&T could work as the holding company for these seven verticals. In the process of simplification, some may also be required to be sold. L&T was earlier toying with the idea of setting up 9 to 12 such verticals.  “I have to ensure that L&T businesses are simplified with each business headed by a professional CEO. The structure may consist of a vertical or a company under a company, or a separate listed entity. The seven broad verticals of L&T are likely to be infrastructure, metals & minerals, water, EPC, hydrocarbons, power, heavy engineering and shipbuilding,” Naik said. He got an extension of five years in 2012 to find an able successor and restructure L&T into a leaner organization from a complex one doing almost everything.  L&T’s MD & CEO K Venkataramanan, along with two other directors, are set to retire this year. Their exits will leave S N Subrahmanyan and R Shankar Raman — both just over 50 years old — as the executives to watch out for in L&T. Naik also refused to disclose who will succeed Venkataramanan, who retires in a few months. Besides, two executives from outside are expected to join L&T soon, one of whom would lead the hydrocarbons business.  L&T, along with its 21 companies, is involved in the entire infrastructure value chain which includes roads, bridges, airports, ports, transmission lines, real estate, electrical and automation, construction and mining machinery, power equipment, hydrocarbons engineering, heavy engineering, shipbuilding, civil works, defence besides, IT and finance.

LT,2013-04-29T06:31:00+05:30,TNN,Row over L&T gesture,"The new club's design, comprising three floors, a centralised kitchen, a convention centre, a press conference hall and two restaurants, has been plan","HYDERABAD: Plans to build a swankier press club at Somajiguda had run into controversy with several members of the club objecting to the decision, which they say, has been taken by the management without taking majority of journalists into confidence.  The new club's design, comprising three floors, a centralised kitchen, a convention centre, a press conference hall and two restaurants, has been planned by construction firm Larsen and Toubro (L&T).  While club authorities said that the total cost would be around Rs 4-5 crore, they clarified that the construction major is helping the club in executing the project as a 'goodwill gesture'. During an emergency general body meeting held on Sunday at the club to discuss the plans, members raised questions on the involvement of L&T in the project. Last week, L&T engineers gave a power point presentation on the design of the new building to a selected few members, which did not go down well with the remaining.  When this issue was raised at the meeting, club committee president GS Vasu said that the firm had prepared the designs of the floor, will help in identifying the contractor and will monitor the construction free of cost. ""The engineering firm has only agreed to 'guide and supervise' the execution of the project as merely a goodwill gesture. There is no quid pro quo involved,"" Vasu read out from a statement.  Larsen & Toubro is building the metro rail project in Hyderabad at an estimated cost of Rs 14,132 crore. The project has been dogged with inordinate delay and there has been numerous complaints on allotment of prime land at dirt cheap rates. A case has been filed against the project by traders of Ameerpet, saying that the alignment of the project has been changed unilaterally, violating the detailed project report.  L&T has not been able to make inroads into the Sultan Bazaar area due to resistance from locals.  ""There is no doubt that the metro project has given L&T negative branding and I am sure they would do anything that could boost their image in Hyderabad,"" an analyst said.  During Sunday's meeting, a section of the media from the Telangana Journalists' Forum said that the decision to go ahead with the construction was taken by a committee, whose term in office had ended on April 17. ""The meeting was held in an undemocratic manner and I was denied an opportunity to express my views on the continuation of the present body. In fact, the matter is not in agenda. How can they pass the resolution?"" questioned Palle Ravi Kumar, vice president of the Telangana Journalists' Forum.  ""Why is a new building required when the present premises itself is sufficient to cater to the needs of members? The present body has failed in giving good service to members. Let an election be conducted and the new body would decide whether to take up the new building or not?"" pointed V Satish from 10TV news channel. Another senior scribe from V6 channel, Ch Kranti, opposed the idea of postponing the election of a new committee and constructing a new building.  However, without taking the objections into consideration or even taking up the voting, the committee suddenly announced that the resolution to extend the term of the present body was passed on the basis of 'voice vote'.  Members were also objecting as the prime land in Somajiguda has not been given by the government on lease to the club. ""After raising Rs 5 crore and completing the building, if the new government decides to cancel the allotment what will happen to the entire effort?"" pointed a senior scribe.  Although prime land in Somajiguda was allotted to Hyderabad Press Club in 1996, till date, the state government has not carried out a lease agreement in favour of the club and the owner of the land is roads and building department. In 2002, then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu has said no to a proposal by the club to erect a few rooms for outstation travelling journalists.  When contacted, club president GS Vasu said that all was well. ""A couple of members had raised some issues which have been answered and everything has been resolved. L&T is not doing any favour and that has been clarified,"" Vasu added. ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/row-over-lt-gesture/articleshow/19775384.cms

Water and sewer lines are crisscrossing the three metro corridors at several areas in the city and metro rail developer Larsen and Toubro (L&T) has been shifting lines during earth excavation works.  Water board officials claim L&T authorities were shifting water and sewer lines without consulting them. As a result, the water and sewer pipeline alignment were getting disrupted. The issue came to light recently when a few water board managers brought the issue to the notice of senior officers.  In the latest incident, the L&T had proposed to shift water pipelines on Road No. 36, Jubilee Hills, as part of earth excavation works. They began shifting the lines without consulting general manager concerned. On learning about it, the general manager (O&M Division-VI) inspected the spot and informed to his superior, director of operations (DoP), G Rameshwar Rao.  ""Though water board has submitted blueprints to the L&T-HMRL before execution of metro rail works, shifting of pipelines is happening without proper coordination. They do not know the likely consequences. It is mandatory that they have to take water board assistance at the time of shifting water and sewer lines, which they are not doing,"" HMWS&SB director of operations, G Rameshwar Rao told TOI. ""We fear if the shifting is not done properly, we may face long-term problems once Krishna phase-III and Godavari phase-I are commissioned,"" the official added.  ""We have asked general managers to come up with latest reports on shifting water and sewer lines in their jurisdictions. We will hold a joint meeting with both L&T and HMRL officials soon and explain about the problems in shifting the lines,"" he added.

His acceptance came after the c," HYDERABAD: Larsen & Toubro chairman A M Naik on Saturday apologized to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for the anguish caused to the CM following the leak of its letters written in September this year to the government threatening to withdraw from the Hyderabad Metro Rail project. The company also agreed to change the alignment of the project as per KCR's suggestions.  Naik, during a meeting with the chief minister at Secretariat, told the latter that his company has no issues with the Telangana government. The L&T honcho also informed the chief minister that it was unfortunate that his company's letters created difficulties for the government and that he was tendering an unqualified apology for the same, a release from the chief minister's office said.  Naik further said his company would comply with the suggestions to change the alignment of the project at some places. His acceptance came after the chief minister made it clear that there would be no compromise on the issue of change of alignment.  Chandrasekhar Rao told Naik that there was a lot of 'emotional involvement' with the Martyrs' Memorial in front of the state legislative assembly and since the current alignment of the project would result in its removal, the route should be changed and divert it from behind the assembly building.  Similarly, the company should realign the line at Sultan Bazar to preserve the historical buildings and market and take it from behind Women's College at Koti and with respect to the second phase of the project that passes through the Old City, the company should take into consideration the suggestions of elected representatives from that part of Hyderabad. The MLAs as well as corporators representing the Old City areas have been demanding a change in the alignment to preserve several places of worship, including mosques and temples, the chief minister told Naik.  Naik's apology came after Chandrasekhar Rao explained that he believed that the letters were used by 'Andhra media' to create doubts over the completion of the Metro Rail project at a time when the works were progressing smoothly. ""The Andhra media used the letters to cause confusion among L&T representatives here and to derail progress in Telangana. The letters caused me a lot of pain because I decided to come back into active politics with the only aim of developing the state and to make Hyderabad a world-class city. We have been cooperating at all levels with the company for the Metro Rail project and its progress has become much faster after the TRS government came to power,"" Chandrasekhar Rao told Naik.  Later, V.B. Gadgil, chief executive & managing director of L&T Metro Rail (Hyd) Ltd., told TOI that the meeting between Naik and the chief minister was held in a cordial atmosphere.""In addition to discussing various issues related to the project, the meeting also served as an important confidence and trust building event,"" he said.  Gadgil also said the chief minister wanted to know more about L&T and the kinds of projects it undertakes. ""The issues discussed included alignment of the project and other important aspects related to it. The discussions are a continuous process. Another meeting is scheduled for November 20 when the project monitoring committee will get together and continue discussion on the issues that were taken up today by the chief minister and Naik,"" Gadgil said.  The meeting was also attended by the company representatives Gadgil, chief financial officer Shankar Raman, GHMC commissioner Somesh Kumar, HMDA chairman Pradip Chandra, district collector MK Meena and principal secretary to the chief minister Narsing Rao.

Experts from the company had conducted a three-day survey earlier to identify locations for the stations.  Metro officials said, Systra will be presenting a report on the layout plan of eight metro stations falling on priority section from Transport Nagar to Charbagh Railway Station (about 8 km). After getting LMRC (Lucknow Metro Corporation Officials) authorities’ approval, Systra will then prepare the structural design of stations highlighting entry-exit points, elevators, token counters and other amenities.  Once LMRC gives its nod to the design, Larsen and Toubro (L&T) will be asked to begin constructing metro stations alongside viaduct construction. “If all goes as per schedule, the metro station work shall begin in a month’s time.

The list reveals which companies around the world are doing the most to combat climate change. It has 187 companies from across the globe that illustrate that a low-carbon future does not mean low profit.  Most of the companies performing better in terms of their efforts to combat climate change are located in Europe, followed by the US and Japan.  The Indian companies that made it to the list â CDP Climate Performance Leadership Index 2014 â are: Essar Oil, Larsen & Toubro, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro.  This new global index has been prepared by the CDP â an international not-for-profit organization â at the behest of 767 investors who represent more than a third of the worldâs invested capital. The CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) is the only global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share vital environmental information.  âAwarded an âAâ grade for their performance, they (the companies in the list) earn a position on the first global ranking of corporate efforts to mitigate climate changeâ, said the organization in a statement while releasing the report comprising the names of the companies and the parameters\methodology followed on Wednesday.  It said, âCollectively the climate performance leaders have reduced their total (absolute) emissions by 33 million metric tons in the past reporting year, equivalent to turning Londonâs car owners into cyclists for two-and-a-half yearsâ.  Paul Simpson, chief executive officer of CDP said, âThe businesses that have made it onto our first ever global list of climate performance leaders are to be congratulated for their progress; they debunk economic arguments against reducing emissions. However, global emissions continue to rise at an alarming rate. Businesses and governments must raise their climate ambition. The data shows that there is neither an excuse nor the time for lethargy.â  The India 2014 report titled âIndian companies decouple business growth from carbon emissionsâ reveals that energy efficiency is the key means by which companies are acting on climate change.  âOver 60% of surveyed companies are introducing process energy efficiency initiatives, consequently, 24% have reduced their absolute emissions and an additional 26% have reduced their emissions intensity while driving business growth and profitabilityâ, said the report.  The report that analyzed the responses from the top 200 Indian companies by market capitalization found that the companies are now better at identifying and prioritizing the climate change issues they want to actively manage.  The occasion also saw release of the CDP India 200 Climate Change Report 2014, showing how the Indian companies are using their increased commitment to climate change action to drive innovative sustainable businesses processes.  According to the report, the Indian companies expressed their eagerness to engage with the government to keep abreast with regulatory changes. This will ensure that they can take necessary precautions and proactively maintain their competitive advantage and brand image.

The two mines have been allotted to Larsen and Toubro (L&T).  In a memorandum, submitted to the district administration, the saffron party has urged the state government not to recommend the Centre to give mining lease (ML) to L&T. The party claimed that the company has failed to establish its end-use plant in Rayagada district.  The party alleged that in 1991, L&T had obtained prospecting licence for Sijimali and Kutrumali mines to establish its refinery and smelter plant in the district. But after keeping the two mines for over two decades, the company is now trying to export minerals to VAL's facilities outside the district, the party added.  ""Locals had hoped that establishment of a refinery and a smelter plant in the region will strengthen their economic condition and develop the area. But, now as L&T has failed to establish its units, we demand before the state government not to recommend ML for the company,"" said BJP's state executive committee member Kaliram Majhi.

Earlier, all the 12 gram sabhas held in July and August had rejected to Vedanta's plan to mine Niyamgiri for bauxite reserves.

He said the company is confident of bagging at least one or two large projects.  The company last week bagged a Rs 5,100-crore EPC order from the Madhya Pradesh state utility to set up a 1,320-mw super critical thermal power plant.  ""There is a potential of 6,000-8,000 mw worth projects in states like Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra, Bengal and Bihar among others. Also some projects of the state-run NTPC are likely to come up for bidding. Of these, we believe at least 3,000-4,000 mw projects will come up for bidding this year,"" he said.  The sluggish macroeconomic conditions and delays in clearances has impacted the power sector, he said.  ""No new projects were bid out due to various policy hurdles. Even the private sector was not willing to invest in the sector. But now the government's situation has improved and the states are taking the initiative and we see some activity from the public sector as well,"" Roy said.  L&T's revenues from the power sector in the first quarter of the current fiscal declined 32 percent to Rs 980 crore from Rs 1,447 crore year-ago due to depleting orderbooks in an investment constrained economy.  He further said the company will also bid for ultra mega power projects as and when they would come up.  The country's largest engineering and construction major is currently executing multiple large EPC, boiler turbine generator and balance of plant power projects in the country as well as some abroad.  The company has established joint ventures with Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems of Japan for manufacture of supercritical boilers and turbines at its complex at Hazira in Gujarat.

The flyovers will come up at Khandari, Sultanganj and Water Works crossings at a cost of Rs 1,928 crore. The private concessionaire, Reliance Infra, which is executing the project, said work will start with the flyover at Water Works crossing from September 18 and the remaining two will follow at intervals of one month. Infrastructure company Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has been given the contract to build the flyovers that will stretch across 600 meters and will allow the highway traffic to cross the city without waiting at local traffic signals. Reliance Infra had been handed the responsibilities of the project in 2012 with a deadline to be met in April 2015. But several hitches delayed the project. “There were land acquisition issues at the work sites and also troubles in getting the Union forest ministry’s approval to remove 10,000 trees to facilitate construction. The project is now expected to get over by April 2016,” said Yashpal Singh Jadon, manager (technical), NHAI. The project got a new lease of life after local MP Ramshankar Katheria raised the issue with Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari recently, who in turn, directed the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to take up the matter on priority basis. The decision to finally start construction was announced during a meeting Katheria held with NHAI officials, Reliance Infra and L&T on Friday. Issues like proper maintenance of the highway, service lanes and drains along the roads were also discussed.  Katheria warned that if the condition of the highway, which is littered with potholes and filth, is not improved in a fixed time, an agitation against would be launched against all those responsible and a decision to stop paying toll tax would also be considered. “Several accidents have taken place on the highway due to the bad condition of the road. I don’t know what commuters are paying toll taxes for – accidents or better traveling experience? This issue should also be considered along with construction of flyovers,” said K C Jain, secretary, Agra Development Foundation.

The infrastructure finance arm of engineering giant Larsen & Toubro resumed the fund-raising exercise after the general election and aims to finish by next year. The money is expected to be raised from domestic and foreign institutional investors. A senior executive at a global secondaries fund, a direct investor in such PE funds, confirmed that it was one of those approached.  ""Some of the global pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and family offices have (also) been approached for the fund raising,"" the executive said. There is renewed interest in infrastructure with the Narendra Modi government keen to ensure that projects stuck for years get going again so that the country can take advantage of an economic turnaround that's looking increasingly likely, given the economic and industrial data.  Delays in execution, mostly due to lack of government approval, and high-debt levels have plagued infrastructure companies over the past few years. Investor confidence has been dented, leading to a slump in capital expenditure. This meant that the L&T Infra PE fund had met with muted investor demand when it was launched last year.  ""The change in government has helped revive the mood. However, only when positive policy measures are undertaken will investors come back to India,"" said a limited partner (LP) who was approached by L&T Infra. ""The fund size could come down due to the lack of investor appetite for infra at this point of time."" Limited partners contribute money to PE funds.  An L&T Infra Finance spokesperson said by email: ""We had a first closing of approximately Rs 500 crore from domestic investors. We are assessing the interest of international investors given the change in their outlook towards India and will begin the formal process after completing the first-level assessment."" India holds opportunity for PE funds in the sector, according to Global consulting firm Deloitte.  ""Private equity represents a modest share of the $1-trillion to be spent on infrastructure in 2012-17, about half of which would come from private sector funds, compared with a target of one-third in the previous five years,"" it had said in a report.  Betting on a massive need for electricity, roads, ports, irrigation, water supply and sanitation projects, other PE companies such as IDFC Alternatives, ICICI Venture and IL&FS have either recently raised funds or are in the process of doing so. But investors won't be jumping back in with their eyes closed. ""The investor is selective with capital this time around.  We will not see the kind of euphoria we saw in the previous cycle,"" said a managing director at an infrastructure-focused PE fund. The subdued sentiment is also because existing infrastructure-focused funds have failed to deliver. ""The returns are nowhere in sight and the report card for most funds is in the red,"" the fund manager said. ""Unless we get a strong push from the government, the infra story will not play out.""

Dhamra Port, jointly promoted by infrastructure conglomerate Larsen and Toubro and Tata group has been holding talks with several port operators including Adani Group and various sovereign and private equity funds in the past.  While uncertainties loom large over the necessary infrastructure at the port involving the road and rail network, APM Terminals's negotiations has progressed further than others with L&T and Dhamra Port. A stake acquisition in Dhamra would enable APM Terminals to improve its presence on the country's east coast.  ""APM has now emerged as the front runner to acquire the stake to be offloaded by Larsen & Toubro. APM is also looking at developing the container facility at the port and if they clinch the deal, they will now own one port on the west and east coast of the country"", said a person close to the development.  Dhamra Port was built at an estimated cost of Rs 3200 crore with a capacity to load 27 mt of cargo. The port, which is outside the purview of union government control, is free to set its own rates unlike at major ports where rates are fixed by the union government.  In India, APM currently operates various container terminals across major and minor ports and also own one of the largest ports on the west coast, the Gujarat Pipavav Port. According to sources, Tata Group, the other joint venture partner is also likely to sell 26% stake that it holds in the company paving way for APM to acquire more than 75% stake in the company.  Officials at APM Terminals who did not wish to be named said that the company had earlier approached Dhamra Port to set up container terminals at the port, but the project could not be materialized since the port did not have necessary rail and road infrastructure.  ""The port is strategically located as many of the large scale industries have their operations in the area. Vedanta Group and JSW currently use the port facility at Vishakhapatnam instead of Dhamra Port and we see huge potential at Dhamra Port to emerge as one of the largest in the east coast"", said an official from Maersk Line, world's largest shipping company and a subsidiary of AP Moller Maersk.  APM Terminals and Larsen and Toubro did not respond to emails sent by ET. Earlier this year, L&T Chairman had said the company had identified Dhamra Port Company Ltd as a non-core asset and had said that the company is looking to find a buyer by the end of this fiscal.  ""Within India, the ports on the east coast have been growing at a much faster pace than the ports on the west coast. The Intra-Asia trade has been witnessing better growth and that makes the ports on the east coast a lucrative option for various terminal operators"", said Manish Saigal, Head, Transportation at leading advisory firm, KPMG.  On the east coast, APM's biggest rival DP world had earlier signed an agreement with the West Bengal government to develop a new port at Kulpi. DPCL was awarded concession by Orissa government to build and operate a port on the Dhamra river in Bhadrak district on BOOST (Build, Own, Operate, Share and Transfer) basis for a total period of 34 years, including a period of 4 years for construction.  Dhamra Port is yet to register profits since it commenced operations and had posted a loss of Rs 458 crore last year, largely due to high interest cost and amortization. DPCL, which can handle about 25 million tonne cargo of various types of coal, limestone and iron ore, had handled 5.1 million tonne total cargo last fiscal.  Located between two major ports, Haldia and Paradip, DPCL is one of the deepest ports of India with a depth of 18 metres, which can accommodate super cape-size vessels up to 1,80,000 DWT.

The top executives of the country's biggest bluechip companies, forming part of the stock market's 30-share benchmark index sensex, were paid an average remuneration of Rs 9.9 crore in the latest fiscal 2013-14 - up from about Rs 8.5 crore in the previous year.  In comparison, the average CEO pay for the companies forming part of the US stock market's 30-share benchmark index DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) stood at $17.5 million (Rs 105 crore) during the last year.  The corresponding figures for the UK and Germany stood at about Rs 60 crore and Rs 50 crore, respectively, in 2013 - which are also significantly higher than the Indian average.The average CEO pay for the sensex companies would come down even further if the figures for the six PSU companies are taken into account, as their annual packages are considerably lower as they follow government regulations for salaries.  The average figure of Rs 10.1 crore for the fiscal year 2013-14 has been derived through an analysis of the latest pay disclosures so far made by the private sector sensex companies in their latest annual reports. However, the figures does not include the value of stocks owned by these persons, as also the other accrued benefits such as dividend payouts that may arise from share ownerships.  There are 24 private sector companies in the 30-share index, but six of them are yet to make public their 2013-14 annual reports. These six companies are Larsen and Toubro, Cipla, Bharti Airtel, Maruti, Sun Pharma and Hindalco.  Among these 18 Sensex companies taken into account, only four showed a decline in their CEO compensation for the latest fiscal, while the annual pay remained unchanged in one case -- Reliance Industries' Mukesh Ambani -- at Rs 15 crore.  The pay package increased at TCS, Bajaj Auto, Axis Bank, ITC, Dr Reddy's, Hero Motocorp, HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Tata Power, Wipro, M&M and Tata Motors.  Those recording a decline in their annual CEO pay package included HUL, where Sanjiv Mehta took over the leadership baton from Nitin Paranjpe during middle of the fiscal in October 2013. Others with lower CEO pay during 2013-14 were Sesa Sterlite, Tata Steel and Infosys, whose outgoing CEO S D Shibulal was among the lowest paid in Sensex-club at just about Rs 16 lakh (down from Rs 65 lakh in previous fiscal).  Among those with higher pay packages, Hero Motocorp's Managing Director and CEO Pawan Munjal got a total pay package of Rs 37.9 crore in 2013-14, up from Rs 32.8 crore in the previous fiscal. This included nearly Rs 3.5 crore as salary and Rs 29.8 crore as commission, among others.  In the US, technology major Oracle Corp's Larry Ellison was the top-paid among blue-chip American firms with a pay package of USD 78.4 million (over Rs 470 crore), while Houston-based Cheniere Energy's CEO Charif Souki topped the overall chart with remuneration of USD 142 million (over Rs 850 crore) in 2013.

It was earlier planned to extend the runway to 3,050 metres.  Speaking after laying the foundation stone of the airport terminal building at Mattannur here, Chandy said the decision to extend the runway was taken at the director board meeting held the other day. He said 75 acres would have to be acquired for the purpose and the process was on. The runway width will be 45 metres.  He said the KIAL work would be closely monitored by him as it was one of the Navaratna projects under 'Mission 676' of the government. Unlike many other projects, the KIAL project was a role model as it had begun after a proper report was prepared and approved by the agencies concerned.  Officials said the project was expected to meet the deadline as Larsen & Toubro (L&T) was doing the airside, runway and terminal work, ensuing better coordination.  The total area of the airport is nearly 8 lakh sq ft, which is double the size of Kozhikode airport. It will be developed in an eco-friendly manner. In the first phase, the project will cost around Rs 1,892 crore, of which the government stake will be 35% in the form of land. It will have 49% stake by public sector establishments, including a 21% stake of BPCL. The private sector stake will be 16%.  While the runway and airside works have been awarded for Rs 694 crore, the passenger terminal building will cost Rs 498.7 crore. The KIAL has 1,278 acres in possession and the process for acquiring 644 acres is on. Apart from this, acquisition of 11.44 acres for the first phase is progressing.  The airport terminal building area will be 75,000 sq m, which will have a peak hour passenger capacity of 2,000. To facilitate this, there will be 48 check-in counters, 32 emigration counters and 16 customs counters. There will be duty-free shops and food courts.  The terminal will also have 16 escalators, 17 elevators and four conveyors. There will be parking facility for 700 cars, 200 taxis and 25 buses in the airport complex.  Ports minister K Babu said in his presidential address that the work was progressing smoothly and the trial landing of the first flight would be in December 2015. The commercial services are expected to begin by May 2016.  KIAL managing director G Chandramauli presented the report.

LT,2014-06-26T16:53:00+05:30,Piyush Pandey,"L&T, Schneider Electric move out of Nashik",India Business News: The latest to join the bandwagon of those pulling out include French major Schneider Electric and Indian engineering giant Larsen and Toubro (L&T).," NASHIK: Maharashtra’s third largest city and India’s 11th most populous district, that forms an important part of the golden triangle for industrial development between Pune and Mumbai, is losing its significance as a centre for manufacturing. Not only have no major industries come up in Nashik in the last few years, but a few existing ones are now bidding adieu to the city of grapes.  The latest to join the bandwagon of those pulling out include French major Schneider Electric and Indian engineering giant Larsen and Toubro (L&T). Many others, meanwhile, continue to operate only with a skeletal structure.  Sources in the know said L&T has put its industrial plot, spread over 15,426 sq m in Ambad, MIDC in Nashik along with factory building including infrastructure on the block. The plot with a built up area of 3,566 sq m, which functioned as a switchgear factory, is expected to be sold for anywhere between Rs 20 crore and 25 crore. When contacted by TOI, an L&T spokesman said; “The move is in line with the company’s renewed focus on concentrating on its core business and doing away with non-synergy businesses.”  Not everyone is offering corporate strategy as an excuse to quit Nashik. Some are directly pointing to issues like high cost of power, high cost of labour and high taxes as reasons to move out.  It is learnt that Schneider Electric too is moving out of Nashik to expand its presence in the neighboring state of Gujarat. Spread over 35,000 sq m, Schneider’s Nasik plant manufactures push buttons, pilot lights, starters and panels, employing about 400 people.  “Industries in Nashik and Maharashtra are becoming uncompetitive because of bad industrial policy. We have local body tax (LBT) issues and high cost of power, which is forcing industries in the state to move to other states like Gujarat and Himachal, which are offering better incentives,” said Manish Kothari, president, Nashik Industries & Manufacturing Association said.  Nashik boasts of hosting manufacturing units of several multinational corporations such as Siemens, Samsonite, GSK, ABB, HUL. Besides, several Indian companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra, MICO, Crompton Greaves, Kirloskar, Raymond Steel, Jindals, L&T, Ceat, VIP Industries, Carbon Everflow, Garware and Jyoti Structures have manufacturing plants in Nashik, according to the government website. Most of Nasik’s industrial units are concentrated in the Satpur, Ambad and Sinnar areas employing about 20,000 permanent employees and over 10,000 contractual workers.  But the writing is on the wall. VIP Industries that used to employ 3,000 people at one point is now operating with a skeletal staff of 300. Companies like ABB have also reduced the number of working days to five as the production has fallen, sources said.  “If you look at Nasik, it’s a hub for manufacturing automobiles and switch gear equipments. Till 2010, we were booked for 6 years. In the last couple of years, the infrastructure projects have stalled and over 80% of the orders are on hold leading to cut in production days and hence retrenchment of workers,” reasoned Kothari.  Admitting that no new industry has come up in Nashik in the last three years, CEAT VP Radheshyam Kedia told TOI, “The environment has become very challenging in the last few years. At some point or the other, some of the units in Nashik face labour unrest. The cost of manpower in Nashik has gone up too as the industrial units are in vicinity of the city, leading to higher aspirations among employees.”  CEAT is also not planning any fresh investments in Nashik, while it is expanding its unit in Gujarat with investments of Rs 750 crore as Gujarat has become more competitive compared to Nashik.  Similarly Mahindra & Mahindra, one of the largest employers in Nashik with a staff base of over 7,000 and at par with the public sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), is also not able to achieve full capacity at the Nashik plant amidst slowdown. The company is planning to invest Rs 4,000 crore in a new plant but unfortunately Nashik is not on its radar as it is negotiating with other state governments for incentives, said sources in the know.  Industry body CII’s Nasik zone president Nishikant Ahire believes that Nashik needs air connectivity to grow businesses. “We have two runways but still we don’t have air connectivity. We need direct flights to Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore for our businesses to grow. The government needs political will to grow Nashik as an industrial hub.”  The reasons are all too well known. But at a time when states are competing to attract investments, if the state government does not get its act together to support Nashik, not only will it lose existing investments but also jobs.

Yesterday, the 30 share benchmark index had hit previous lifetime high of 25,644.77 and ended at record closing high of 25,580.21 on optimism over government's agenda for reforms.

It surpassed previous intra-day record of 7,673.70 reached yesterday.

There are nearly 600 people at work and also around 260 machineries are deployed for the speedy execution of the work. Since 11.44 acres more is needed for the runway, the collector has been given the power for direct purchase so that there will not be any delay in the work, said the minister.  ""If everything goes according to our plan, the first flight will land here before December 31, 2015,"" he said.  In the first phase the runway will be 3,050 metres long but in the next phase its length will be extended to 3,400 metres, he added.

Still, Naik cautioned that given the slowdown in the sector, the recovery would take time to set in. ""It would be a few months, may be by August-September,"" he said.

LT,2012-08-22T01:18:00+05:30,B V Shiv Shankar,Larsen & Toubro told to halt metro works for biodiversity meet,The city’s metro rail project has hit yet another roadblock. The government in its mad rush to beautify the city for COP 11 has instructed Larsen & To," HYDERABAD: The city’s metro rail project has hit yet another roadblock. The government in its mad rush to beautify the city for COP 11 has instructed Larsen & Toubro that is executing the metro rail project, to stop work until the international biodiversity summit is over. But the instruction has caught L&T in a bind. For starters, it has come verbally and makes no mention whatsoever of compensating L&T for the loss it would incur for the days of work lost, that they estimate would be around Rs 300 crore.  The Hyderabad Metro Rail authorities had verbally informed L&T in the first week of August to stop metro work from August 15 to October 19, when COP 11 ends. While L&T has so far not stopped work, officials said on Tuesday that pressure was mounting on them. “The government wants to get away without paying compensation by issuing such oral instructions. This is not fair as we will suffer a huge loss. If they want us to stop work, they must allow us to invoke Force Majeure clause,” said a highly placed source in L&T. As per the concession agreement, L&T, the project concessionaire, can invoke Force Majeure clause claiming the compensation if the government issues “official instructions” to stop work. In the absence of a written communication, officials peg their estimated loss for this 60-day break at around Rs 300 crore, estimating that each day’s delay is adding Rs 5 crore to the escalating project cost.  Chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy had directed government officials to ensure that metro rail work did not come in the way of the bio-diversity convention to be held in the city from October 1 to 19.  Official denies effect of COP 11 on metro works  The CM had sanctioned Rs 125 crore for city beautification, which includes a plan to upgrade 125-km road corridor from airport to star hotels, constructing 35 new fountains, proper sanitation and remodeling of junctions among others.  But NVS Reddy, managing director of HMRL, played down L&T’s concern. He said, “It is not a big deal. If L&T wants us to issue instructions in writing, we are ready to do it. But, it has to be done on a proper forum.” Denying the effect of COP 11 on metro project, Reddy said the works would be continuing in other parts of the city in the non-COP areas. “When the works would continue in other parts of the city, where is the question of invoking Force Majeure clause and paying for the loss,” he questioned.  However, sources in L&T said the government has asked the company to stop the entire work as the beautification work is being carried out across the city and not just the arterial roads that delegates would be using. They further said that the amount of money the government was spending on beautification in non-COP areas would go waste as L&T would demolish all of it for metro construction work. And if NVS Reddy’s claim that metro work would continue in non-COP areas is anything to go by, L&T said it would bulldoze over the beautified stretches even before the convention starts.

Prohibitory orders stopping construction activity till safety norms are met were put up at the Shivaji Marg site near Moti Nagar police station by the labour department's Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health.  It said the 3000-strong labour force on the multi-storey complex site will have to be paid minimum wages throughout the period of work suspension. The order was pasted on the gates and walls of the premises, and copies sent to the deputy commissioner of police and trade unions to ensure compliance.  The labour department has also issued directions for an audit of safety measures at the site by an government-approved agency, which would also suggest corrective measures.  The orders come at a time when lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung has asked the labour department and district officials to ensure that the rights of construction workers are protected as per the law.  According to senior labour department officials, the first fatal accident at the DLF site was reported in 2011. This was followed by two labour deaths in 2012 and one in 2013. In January this year, when another worker died at the site, the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health launched prosecution proceedings against the directors of the principal employer, DLF Universal Limited, and contractor Larsen & Toubro. The matter is pending in the trial court.  The present crackdown comes after yet another accident led to a worker's death on May 17. Officials said the deaths indicate that norms for protection of life and safety of workers were not in place. The prohibitory orders were initiated under the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers (regulation of employment & conditions of service) Rules, 2002.  Safety audit done, report likely in 2 days  NEW DELHI: The National Safety Council, it is learnt, has completed the safety audit to ascertain whether construction activity can resume at the DLF site on Shivaji Marg, west Delhi. Reliable sources said the council is likely to submit its report to the government in a couple of days.  The labour department order says construction can resume at the site only if working conditions are found “safe” by the auditors. DLF is promoting a township at the site and has appointed L&T as its contractor. tnn ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-govt-halts-work-at-dlf-project-site/articleshow/35624142.cms

It closed 2.4 per cen","MUMBAI: The Nifty and Sensex surged to their second consecutive record high on Monday as blue-chips such as Larsen & Toubro jumped on rising hopes that exit polls would show the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies winning a majority in the elections.  The Sensex rose as much as 2.52 percent to a record high at 23,572.88, while the Nifty rose as much as 2.35 percent to a life high of 7,020.05, surpassing its previous record hit on Friday.  The optimism comes even as exit polls by media organisations - due to be released after 6:30 p.m. on Monday once the last votes are cast - have proven unreliable in the past. Actual results for India's five-week long elections are due on Friday.  A win for a BJP-led coalition is widely seen as setting the stage for a revival in confidence, investment and growth as Asia's third-largest economy steers through a rough patch.  The Nifty has surged 18.74 percent since Narendra Modi became the BJP candidate on Sept. 13, as the opposition party is perceived by markets as being more business friendly at a time when the economy is growing at its slowest pace in a decade.  ""Markets got a wind of exit poll showing a clear majority for the BJP-led allies, which got extrapolated as better growth prospects for India,"" said Deven Choksey, managing director at K R Choksey Securities.  The Sensex ended up 2.42 percent (or 556.77 points) at 23,551, while the Nifty ended 2.27 percent higher (or 155.45 points) at 7,014.25, adding to their over 3 percent gains on Friday.  Gains were broad-based, with 25 out of 30 listed companies on the benchmark BSE index posting rises.  However, risk was also seen increasing as NSE's volatility index, or India VIX, hit its highest intraday level since March 11, 2009, before ending 1.6 percent lower.  Also on watch, consumer price inflation data due later in the day, the last one before the RBI's next policy review on June 3.  Domestic-oriented shares led the rally, with the NSE bank sub-index hitting a record high. State Bank of India Ltd gained 3.2 percent, while Larsen & Toubro Ltd rose 3.3 percent.  Infrastructure shares also gained, with Ambuja Cements up 2.1 percent, while state-run power equipment maker Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd surged 2.4 percent.  Reliance Industries Ltd gained 3.1 percent after the company and its partners in a gas block said on Saturday they were taking the government to arbitration seeking implementation of higher gas prices.  However, United Spirits Ltd fell 2.8 percent after it agreed to sell its Whyte & Mackay scotch whisky unit to Emperador Inc in a 430 million pound ($729 million) deal, a valuation that was seen as lower than estimates by some analysts.

L&T Finance was at one time seen as a front-runner in the race for a banking licence. However, its aspirations remained unfulfilled with the Reserve Bank of India choosing to award a licence to IDFC and Bandhan Microfinance.  Television channel ET Now reported late Tuesday that L&T Finance was eyeing the promoters' stake in YES Bank, which is held by two family groups — one led by CEO Rana Kapoor and the other by Kapoor's sister-in-law Madhu Kapur.  When asked about the deal, Kapoor told Times Of India that he was amused to hear the reports. ""All I can add is that I and my management team are deeply committed to building the best quality bank of the world in India,"" said Kapoor. When asked whether any change in shareholding was likely, he said, ""I am not aware of it and if I am not aware of it, I do not know many people who may be aware of it.""  Responding to the reports, an L&T Finance spokesperson said that the company does not respond to market speculation.  L&T Finance is worth around Rs 11,700 crore and YES Bank has a market capitalization of Rs 15,660 crore. Both the companies will hold board meetings on Wednesday to announce their results for FY14. YES Bank's promoters hold 25.5% in the bank while Larsen & Toubro has a 76.6% stake in L&T Finance.  Analysts could not hypothesize on the nature of a deal that could take place. They said that RBI has been very particular about not letting any bank or branch licence being acquired through the back door.  In the past, it had stymied many such deals, including HSBC's acquisition of RBS.  In reply to a TOI query on L&T Finance's interest in the bank, Kapoor said, ""Our bank is 10 years old and naturally people will look at it strategically. I don't know what L&T is doing or what IDFC is doing or what other corporate houses are doing. We like our independence, we are an entrepreneurial bank, we are a professional bank and we want to uphold that character and we want to uphold the trust that we have built.""  Kapoor added, ""I would say in its 10th year, the bank is entering the third gear. We will be in full throttle in this phase and once the economy stabilizes and starts correcting itself, a bank like ours, which has shown growth even in difficult times, will be a significant beneficiary of an improved economic environment.""  The founder of the country's youngest private bank also said that in the last decade the management has put in 20 years of effort to build a bank against all possible odds — the global, Indian and the Eurozone crises. ""Our results on Wednesday mark 10 years of our operations and they will speak for themselves.""  Until now, NBFCs such as Kotak Mahindra have got into banking only by acquiring a banking licence. There have been instances of banks merging businesses of NBFCs with themselves. This included the deal between the erstwhile Centurion Bank and 20th Century Finance, and IndusInd Bank and Ashok Leyland Finance. However, RBI has frowned on such deals and has put checks in place. There are also restrictions on strategic investors picking up more than a 5% stake in a bank.

A turnaround of the insurance business along with a reversal of fortunes in the core retail operations following a series of restructuring and asset sales is believed to responsible for Biyani seeking to renegotiate the exit contract with L&T, said multiple sources involved in the negotiations.  Since 2007, Future Generali India Insurance has been a JV between Future Group and Italian insurer Generali, the largest in Europe. Future Group owns 74 per cent stake in the company while the Italian insurer owns 26 per cent - the highest permissible limit by Indian laws.   However last March, L&T, Future Group and Generali Group had signed a non-binding agreement to consolidate their operations through a merger. Upon completion, it would have led to L&T buying 51% in Biyani-Generali general insurance venture with the Italians retaining 26%. Various Future Group entities would have ended up with a 23% stake. The deal valued Future Generali India Insurance Company at around Rs 1,100 crore - Rs 1300 crore, even though no official valuation disclosures were made public.  A successful monetisation would have also seen Pantaloon Retail -- now rechristened Future Retail Limited (FRL) - completely exit the venture, thereby further delevaraging the balance sheet of the Biyani bell weather.  Out of Future Group's 74 per cent stake in the JV, 50 per cent is being held by Pantaloon Retail or FRL. A 24% stake is held by different personal entities of Kishore Biyani and his family.  Senior representatives of Future Group have already sent unofficial feelers to the L&T Finance Holding top brass and a formal communication is expected within this week, possibly as early as by Wednesday.  L&T Finance Holdings is the financial services holding company of engineering major L&T. Founded four years ago, L&T General Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of parent L&T.  When contacted a Future Group spokesperson declined to comment.Mails sent to L&T did not get a response till the time of going to press. But the company informed the exchanges late on Monday evening that the JV discussions have been called after mutual discussions.  ""We have been told that the management will be informed about the deal before the board meeting in May,"" said a Future Generali executive requesting anonymity but added, ""The deal was going slow for last couple of months.""  Sources said, with Future Generali turning profitable, the FRL board advised Biyani to stay invested for another one to two years, further grow the business and enjoy the valuation upside. Subsequently, strategic options including a stake sale or a complete exit can also be revisited.  Future Generali has made a profit of Rs 28.5 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year. The company is expected to make a profit of around Rs 35 crore for the full fiscal year. The gross written premium of the company rose 14% in FY 2013-14 to Rs 1,300 crore. It has a share capital of Rs 710 crore. Based on this growth, Future Generali has set an ambitious target for itself of reaching Rs 200 crore PAT in the next financial year.  Industry experts say apart from being a key player in the auto insurance space, the company has also gained market share offering niche products in marine, engineering, event and film insurance. For example, the recent Zubin Mehta's concert in Mumbai and Srinagar, the AR Rehman show in Mumbai or even the popular Ganesh idol Lalbaugcha Raja were insured by Future Generali.Moreover, over the last 18 months, Future Retail's demerger of its Pantaloons and lifestyle fashion businesses as well partial divestments of its consumer finance and life insurance businesses has helped reduce debt by around Rs 4000 crore. Future Retail has posted an operating profit of Rs 822 crore in the past 12 months and aims to grow this by 30% during the current financial year, enabling it to fund its store expansion and growth through internal accruals and without relying on asset sales or further loans and debt.  In comparison, L&T General insurance is a much smaller operation and has recorded business growth of 52% in April-February 2013-14. The total gross premium income was at Rs 221 cr at the end of February. It has a capital base of around Rs 415 crore and plans to break even in the sixth to seventh year of operation.   ""The valuation parameter has completely changed from the time the deal got announcement last year,"" said Rajiv Suneja partner EY. ""The general insurance industry has seen a turnaround and Future Generali had made profit. As an investor, it does not hurt Future to hold on to their general insurance business whereas Generali is a long term player.""  ""It will be a loss for L&T if not a crippling blow. Future Generali would have helped achieve growth and scale faster rather than building the business brick by brick. It was buying the business for distribution, client relationships and a strong financial partnership. Till date, it has gone solo,"" said an investment banker specialising in financial services.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India is examining data related to both the events to ascertain if securities laws were violated, said people familiar with the development. The government sold its 9% stake in Axis Bank on March 21 through the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) through bulk deals on BSE. Of the 4.2-crore shares, about 1.5-crore are said to have found their way to certain investors privy to the offer price. They then offloaded the stock at a higher price to funds that had originally tied up with merchant bankers to participate in the transaction, said the people cited above.  The practice of trading on a stock on the basis of advance privileged information to take advantage of pending orders - buying low and selling high - is known as front-running . ET had reported on April 2 that some investors had made a killing in the recent Axis Bank share sale. Acting on behalf of the government, three leading merchant banks - JM Financial, Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan - had lined up several domestic and foreign investors for the proposed share sale. While the price band was fixed at Rs 1,290 to Rs 1,357 apiece, sources told ET that prospective buyers were told to place their orders between Rs 1,313 and Rs 1,317. The suspicion is that a handful of investors got a whiff of the prices at which the orders would be placed and instead sought shares at slightly higher price than Rs 1,317 as soon as the market opened on March 21, beating others to the draw.  As a result, they were able to buy 1.5-crore shares at an average price of Rs 1,315.19 before the large funds could step in. The investors who got the shares then sold them to clients of the three merchant bankers for Rs 1,320 to Rs 1,400, allegedly making about .Rs100 crore in just a few hours.  While Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan declined to comment for the story, a JM Financial spokesperson said, ""It is our policy not to comment on any regulatory dialogue on transactions irrespective of whether we have or have not received any communication on the matter.""  The regulator is also examining unusual price movements in L&T Finance's stock price ahead of an offer for sale. On March 13, the L&T Finance stock was added to the futures and options, or F&O, basket, well before the expiry of the ongoing series, raising eyebrows among market participants.  After opening at Rs 86.60 and going to Rs 88 in morning trade on its inclusion in the derivatives segment, there was a drop of as much as 11%, and the stock closed at Rs 79.20. In the evening, both L&T Finance and promoter Larsen and Toubro informed the stock exchanges that the latter would sell 5.55-crore shares, or a 3.23% stake, in L&T Finance to comply with Sebi's minimum public holding norms.  Soon after the release, the floor price for the offer for sale was announced at Rs 70 apiece. It is learnt that Sebi has sought clarifications from L&T on its stake sale, sources said. An official spokesperson for Larsen and Toubro declined to comment for the story.  Some analysts have questioned the way in which the stock was included in the F&O segment in the middle of the series, while others alleged that the drop in the L&T Finance stock price from Rs 88 to Rs 79 levels could have been related to the late evening notice and the Rs 70 floor price.  ""Sebi should investigate the complete flow of events related to the drop in the L&T Finance stock price, beginning from its inclusion in the F&O segment mid-month and the people involved in shorting the stock as they knew the floor price of OFS beforehand,"" said Gaurav Parikh, MD, Jeena Scriptech Alpha Advisors.  As of December 31, 2013, engineering and construction major L&T held 139.98-crore shares of L&T Finance, translating into an 81.50% stake.

The company is set to merge its urban infrastructure and real estate units as part of a business realignment strategy, senior officials said on condition of anonymity.  L&T owns 75% stake in L&T Urban Infrastructure, which builds residential and commercial infrastructure facilities, including IT parks. L&T Realty is its wholly owned subsidiary.  According to property consultants, the merger would spell good news for the company’s current projects especially the Navi Mumbai mixed use development where it recently received a rap from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). The company is learnt to have over 25-million sq ft of projects spread across over 1,000 acres of land across India.  The CAG in its report had said the state government had extended undue benefits of about Rs 464 crore to L&T on incomplete projects on the development of an integrated complex at the Seawood railway station in Navi Mumbai. CAG says despite no progress on the work, Cidco’s board of directors had accepted L&T’s request in August 2009, without approval of the government, for an extension of three years on delayed payment charges.  The developer agreement for the Seawood project was signed on April 21, 2008. L&T paid a lease premium of Rs 724 crore of the total amount due of Rs 1,809 crore. The balance lease premium was to be paid in instalments due on April 2009, 2010 and 2011. However, Cidco, after considering the delay in handing over of the site to the developer, extended the due date of payment from April 21 to June 24 every year, said CAG.  Senior L&T officials had said the delay was due to a dispute between Cidco and Central Railway (CR), due to which the latter did not accord permission to commence the project. ``The project started after CR granted its approval only in August last year and L&T had started the work right after. Since 2008, L&T had spent Rs 1,000 crore on the project,’’ senior officals said.

The 72-inch water main pipe that got breached a month ago, is still under repair. The pipeline which carries raw water to Garden Reach water treatment plant got breached following a micro-tunneling process going parallel to the water service main pipe.  The KMC engineers struggled to get into 17 feet below the road surface because of water gushing out of the pipe and flooding the entire area. One week was spent in the futile exercise of how the civic workforce would get into the spot of the breach. The civic engineers sent SOS to the Larsen & Toubro officials to send a machine which could enable the labourers and the civic engineers to go for sheet pilling exercise which would make it easy for them to get down and start repairing the pipe.  It was only a week ago when the civic workforce could go down underground and sealed parts of the pipe from which huge volume of water was gushing out.  ""Now we have located the breach and have started the actual repair process. But it will take another couple of weeks to make the repairing process foolproof,"" said a KMC water supply department official.  One of the major reasons for the probable delay in the repairing process is that the KMC officials and workers are experienced in repairing pipes which are mostly made of mild steel. Now in this case, the KMC workers are assigned to repair a polymer pipe which demands extra caution.  ""This is our main pipe which takes raw water from the Hooghly and carries it to the treatment plant. If we try to plug the holes in a hurry, it may adversely affect the water supply of large parts of south Kolkata. We will take time but ensure that the pipe gets repaired properly,"" Bibhas Maty, the director-general of the KMC water supply department said.  However, a KMC water supply department conceded that the cost of repair would be all time high. ""We have to calculate and then tell about the cost of repair after completion of the job. It may touch a whopping Rs 1 crore,"" the civic official said. ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkatas-72-inch-main-water-pipe-still-under-repair/articleshow/33175492.cms

After D Damodaran, the chairman, board of governors, IIM-T, awarded the PG diploma in Management (PGDM) to students, Naik handed out the awards for meritorious and all-round performance -- five students in six categories. He advised the students not to forget their roots, no matter which part of the world you went to conquer.  “Wherever you may be, you might excel in New York, you may do wonders in the NASA but don’t forget your roots,” Naik told the new post-graduates while narrating his own life history, and how good value system helped his elevation to the top level of the company. He said he had a dream of joining the L&T, but he could not because he was not an IITian, a class of people the L&T was then inclined to employ.  “I was not an IITian because my father wanted me to serve the poor people. There were foreign-educated students and IITians, but in a year or two I overtook all the IITians and all the ‘foreign-returned guys’ through my sheer passion, devotion, conviction, commitment and the love for L&T that could not described by words,” he told the students.  Naik was against students going abroad at the drop of a hat, and advised the faculty, “Don’t take pride in sending students abroad, if you cannot persuade them against it. We cannot build our nation, if everyone goes to the new economy, to the ITs, to the banking, to finance, to FMCGs, and strategy. If civil engineers are doing programming in IT companies, and the IT companies in Bangalore blame poor infrastructure, it is not done. You are just robbing the talent that should be in infrastructure,” he said.  Explaining the value system again, and how people who left for greener pasture were returning to L&T again, he narrated the story of a man who left L&T after serving in the company for five years on an attractive package.  But he later returned to L&T because he wanted to get the inner peace he had lost midway somewhere.  “The tactics might change, the business methods would change, the new generation will bring new way of thinking but one thing that would never change is your value system, transparency, integrity, commitment to the society.  Later, Naik distributed the gold medal for securing first rank in the PG programme to Tina Marshall, the silver medal to Navin Kumar who also got the HDFC gold medal for academic proficiency in finance & accounting, HDFC gold medal to Karthikeyan for proficiency in marketing, L C Menon award for the outstanding student to Sameera Dhanvala and gold medal for best all-round performance to Anand Kumaresh.

It will be on the lines of the Terminal 3 (T3) of Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, Delhi.  After the construction is over, daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly international flights to Dubai, Middle-East, South-East Asia and Europe will commence from March 2015.  The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has set the deadline of February 17, 2015, for the completion of 60,591 square-metre terminal, which will have state-of-the-art features of T3 of IGI Airport. It will accommodate 1,600 passengers at one point of time and have capacity of eight bays for parking of planes. That's five times bigger than the existing 12,000 square-metre domestic terminal, which was inaugurated in 2011 and has a capacity of only 400 passengers.  Though the new terminal will fall in Jhurjeri village of Mohali district, it will be connected with the domestic terminal in Chandigarh. The Air Traffic Control (ATC) and the runway will continue to be with the local base of the Indian Air Force (IAF).  To ease traffic at the international terminal, a flyover has been constructed, providing departure facility on upper floor, while the arrival will be on the ground floor, just like IGI's T3.  AAI General manager (engineering) D K Kamra said the construction was going on round-the-clock and work on apron and taxiways would be completed by year-end. They faced teething troubles, but were hopeful of completing the work by February next, he added. ""The terminal will be smaller than IGI's T3, but will offer a new level of comfort to travellers,"" he said.

LT,2012-04-27T03:14:00+05:30,B V Shiv Shankar,Metro gives Larsen & Toubro monopoly over city transport,The clause in the concession agreement restricts the government from developing or improving the public transport system along the stretch of the thre," HYDERABAD: While Hyderabad metro rail is expected to be the panacea to the growing traffic congestion in the city, the urban rail services can sound the death knell to other public transport systems already in place in the city due to a monopoly clause granted by the state to Larsen & Toubro, the private partner, through the concession agreement.  The clause in the concession agreement restricts the government from developing or improving the public transport system along the stretch of the three corridors- Miyapur to LB Nagar (corridor-I), Jubilee Bus Station to Falaknuma (corridor-II) and Nagole to Shiplaramam (corridor-III) – where the metro rail is taking shape. This would mean that there would be no scope for the improvement of the city bus service or MMTS (Multi-Model Transport System) that has emerged as a popular mode of urban rail transport.  The concession agreement says: “The government shall not construct any rail or road transport system between, inter alia, the three metro corridors” for a period of 35 years from the date the metro rail becomes operational. Further, L&T is entitled to an additional concession period of another 35 years. That means that the state government cannot develop any other public transport system for over 70 years without the consent of the private engineering company.  More startlingly, the concession agreement even restricts the government from revising the fare for the public transport or extending discounts or reductions in the fare and in the event of breach of these provisions, the government is liable to pay compensation to L&T under the latter’s terms.  This clause can go against the state government and can end up acting against the interests of the commuter for whose benefit the metro rail has been conceived. This is because at a delay of Rs 5 crore per day in the construction of the project, keeping in mind the factors of the prevailing rate of inflation, insurance, currency fluctuation and rate of interest on the escalated project cost, the basic fare of the metro rail is expected to be around Rs 14 as of April 1, 2016. This would mean that the commuter would have to pay a high price for travelling on the metro rail even as the state would be helpless in improving the other modes of transport.  Charging that these provisions of the concession agreement are in violation of the Competition Act 2002, members of civil society, who have already petitioned the AP High Court against Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) on the charges of changing the alignment unilaterally, are now mulling moving the Competition Commission. “The provisions made in the concession agreement are monopolistic and are in defiance of the Competition Act. We are planning to complain to the Competition Commission,” said Prof C Ramachandriah, who is spearheading the agitation against metro rail project.  While citing a similarity of the Hyderabad metro rail case with that of the Bangalore International Airport (BIA) that is facing a case under the Monopolistic Trade Practice Act after it insisted upon the closure of the government-run HAL airport in the city, Ramachandriah said curtailing the growth of public sector companies to suit the needs of private companies was unfair. A petition filed by Vivek Kulkarni, a former IAS officer, against BIA, is pending in the Karnataka high court.  However, authorities in HMRL said the metro rail service would only supplement the existing public transport system, and, hence, would not violate the Competition Act. “We are making use of the city buses as the feeder service for the metro rail. There is no question of treating it as our competitor,” said a senior officer in the HMRL. An e-mail query to the L&T did not elicit reply.

L&T holds 97% stake in Kattupalli International Container Terminal, a port-cum-shipyard complex developed jointly with state government entity TIDCO, which holds the remaining stake. The Rs 3,989-crore project has been struggling to attract traffic, in part due to excess capacity in south India, since it became operational in February last year.  “L&T is in talks with many strategic buyers including some Japanese port operators,” one of the persons said, adding that the group is interested in selling only the port business and may want to exit it. The conglomerate is looking at an enterprise value of Rs 2,300-2,500 crore. However, with Rs 1,500-crore debt on its books, the equity valuation of the port would be Rs 800-1,000 crore, the same person, who did not wish to be named, said. A spokesperson for L&T declined comment.  The company, which has interests in roads, power plants, shipbuilding and real estate among others, has been exiting some non-core businesses. The group has said in the past that it will look at value unlocking opportunities in its development projects.  Analysts say L&T’s port business looks an attractive proposition for both domestic and international buyers as it has all the required regulatory approvals in place. However, any deal for a stake sale in the port would require government approval because the concession agreement signed between L&T Ports and the state government includes the shipbuilding unit as well. L&T’s shipyard, intended to make warships and submarines, has been running below capacity due to lack of defence orders. L&T had told ET earlier that it is taking orders for offshore platforms and containers to keep the unit running.  It is believed that the company is bullish on the defence shipbuilding business and would not like to sell stake in the division to avoid eligibility related issues while bidding for these projects. Another person familiar with the matter said L&T is yet to decide on whether it will sell stake as a single block or in parts. The deal is expected to have a high debt component, as 60%-65 % of the total project cost is debt. This debt might have to be paid by the buyer at the time of purchasing the port due to the complicated deal structure.  Kattupalli is a port owned by the Tamil Nadu government. It was given to L&T for development and operations in 2008. The terminal is operated and maintained by Manilabased port operator International Container Terminal Services Inc. Ports in South India have been recording lower scheduled calls from container shipping lines as the country goes through one of the worst phases of economic slowdown. Excess port capacity created over the last few years, too, has hampered cargo volume and pricing. Chennai Port, which has added more capacity, is still the preferred port on the country’s southeast coast.

LT,2014-01-16T04:29:00+05:30,Namrata Singh,Bank hiring zooms ahead of new licences,"India Business News: The banking sector, which will see the entry of new players this year, is witnessing a hectic pace of activity on the HR front.","MUMBAI: The banking sector, which will see the entry of new players this year, is witnessing a hectic pace of activity on the HR front. An unusually high percentage of hiring is taking place, which is being attributed not only to branch expansion by existing banks but also to the new banking licences that are expected to be issued.  Experts believe this could lead to a war for talent. Prospective players are said to be researching employee databases in existing banks to identify talent. Some are believed to have even kept banking personnel on a standby so that they can hit the ground running, if and when they bag a licence.  With the fear of being poached by new players, existing banks, on the other hand, are boosting their strength and using innovative employee retention tools. Some could even look at golden handcuffs, if faced with a loss of talent, industry sources said.  Large corporate houses like Aditya Birla Group, Larsen & Toubro and Bajaj are in the fray for a banking licence. So are Religare, IDFC, Edelweiss and JM Financial.  ""The banking sector where the hiring rate was not more than 15-20% in 2012-13, has witnessed a spurt in hiring of around 60% till December last year. Most of the existing banks are gearing up by increasing their headcount in order to stay ahead. We expect the trend to continue and grow stronger,"" said Ajay Shah, general manager (BFSI), TeamLease Services, a staffing company.  ""Companies/financial services firms aspiring for a banking licence are putting in place a database of people for senior positions (CXO/CXO-1 levels) that will form the core team. Given their established credentials of having built businesses from ground up, key people in Indian private banks are likely to be prime targets for the new entrants,"" said Animesh Kumar, group head, HR & corporate services, IDFC.  Firms which bag banking licences would get about 18 months to launch operations. To cut down on cycle times and costs, technology, big data and analytics will be key drivers of new ways of acquiring talent and delivering services and products. ""An important source of talent for prospective banking firms would be women managers, especially those who have taken a career break and are now desirous of coming back into formal employment,"" said IDFC's Kumar.  Another interesting talent pool for banking aspirants, he said, is likely to be the Indian diaspora, which is now looking to relocate back to India for personal reasons.  Santrupt Misra, group HR head, Aditya Birla Group, however, said, the group is not hiring for banking. ""It will be presumptuous on our part to do so as the licence issue is not decided,"" he said. The group is not worried given its strong employer brand. ""Should we get a licence, we will take up hiring. Some companies may have done opportunity hiring or may be meeting other needs that are current hoping to leverage when the bank comes up,"" said Misra.  While private banks are worried about the HR challenge, they too are sprucing up their strength. Axis Bank, for instance, is expected to see a double-digit headcount growth this year. The bank is tapping on growth potential at unbanked locations. ""Hiring is primarily towards the expansion plan of the bank. The new banking licences would have an impact few years later,"" said Rajesh Dahiya, president-HR, Axis Bank, who is hopeful that its employee engagement initiatives and growth opportunities within the bank would help retain key talent.  Ratnakar Bank, on the other hand, is expected to close the year (March 31, 2014) with 1,000 hires this year to take its total strength of 2,600 employees. ""The way plans are being discussed, we will continue to hire around 500 or so even in the next year, but it is not finalized yet,"" said Tajinder Kumar, head-HR, Ratnakar Bank.  Kumar admits shortage of talent is a challenge for the sector. ""Existing private banks, other banks and even public sector banks have stepped up hiring efforts in a big way. When new banks come up, although one is not clear on date and count, they will also have a requirement of senior management people,"" he said.  So is it an unusual trend? ""It seems to be a period of significant change in the sector. Technology is playing a very important role in this change, so is operations and sales and distribution. Newer ways of work require different skills, so re-skilling is key,"" said Ratnakar Bank's Kumar.  Even customer expectations have changed. If you look at how banking was done 10 years back and now, there is a vast difference.

The Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (R-APDRP) will address the increasing power consumption in the city and surrounding areas which have been witnessing large-scale development boom.  “There is a 12% annual increase in the city’s power consumption. Currently, we are overloaded and not in a position to give new major connections. We will be struggling to provide power connection to the new KSRTC complex on Mavoor Road once it is operational,” said K Nandakumar, assistant executive engineer with the KSEB.  To meet the increasing requirement, four new 110kV sub stations have been planned under the project. “These will be gas insulated switchgear sub-stations. Places identified for the sub-stations are Kalipoika, Gandhi Road, Pantheerankavu and Feroke. “Cyberpark, new malls and several residential apartments will be coming up in the Pantheerankavu area. The sub-station at Feroke will meet the requirements of projects such as the National Institute for Research and Development in Defence Shipbuilding (Nirdesh). Land is yet to be acquired for sub-stations at Kalipoika and Pantheerankavu” Nandakumar said.  Old transmission lines will be renovated with high capacity steel-reinforced cables. “The old all-aluminium cables will be replaced with steel-reinforced ones. This will check the issue of accidents due to snapping of cables,” Nandakumar said.  All 645 km single-phase lines in the city will be replaced by three-phase connections. “Once the project is complete, there will not be any single phase connections in Kozhikode,” he said.  There are around 70,000 electro-mechanical meters in the city. This will be replaced by new digital meters which will record even the use of electricity by mobile phone chargers. This will enhance the revenue of KSEB. Around 250 new transformers will be installed under the project.  Laying of new 11 kv lines along 100 km and underground cables for 286 km has also been envisaged as part of the project. Underground cables in the city will be brought under the ring main system which will bring down power interruption time.  A supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) centre will be set up at Vellayil. “The control room will help KSEB monitor and locate problems in the distribution lines. We can restore power supply using remote control within five minutes. Earlier it took around three to four hours,” Nandakumar said.  The project will help bring down transmission loss from the current 23.1% to 15%. Larsen and Toubro has been given the contract for the Rs 200-crore project which is expected to be completed within 20 months.  Minister for power Aryadan Mohammad will launch the project at function to be held here on Sunday. Minister for social welfare M K Muneer, MP M K Raghavan, mayor A K Premajam and others will attend the event.

Interest expenses continue to increase and ar," Interest rates may be headed south but there is no respite for India Inc on the interest payments front. Interest expenses continue to increase and are ruling at higher levels compared to the previous year for most companies . Many large companies , which include several blue-chip firms, have seen interest costs surge for October-December 2012. Interest costs as a percentage of net sales and total sales have also increased for these companies, data with the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed.  Public sector behemoth BHEL has seen a more than three-fold jump in interest costs for the quarter. Interest expenses as a percentage of sales and total costs also increased by the same proportion for the company. Telecom major Bharti Airtel shelled out nearly Rs 100 crore more in interest or a 24% year-onyear (y-o-y ) increase for October-December . JSW Steel's interest payments topped Rs 455 crore during the quarter, which is among the highest in the blue-chip pack. Interest costs were Rs 127 crore higher for the company during the period, a 39% y-o-y increase.  ""Interest rates have not gone up (during the quarter). There must have been an incremental increase in borrowings ,"" said K Ramakrishnan , executive director, Spark Capital Advisors. ""The quantum of interest had gone up in many companies due to the prolongation in the working capital cycle,"" said Deven R Choksey, managing director, KR Choksey Shares and Securities .

The City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) is yet to shortlist the company which will be awarded the tender for carrying out its system work, including electrical and mechanical work.  Cidco was set to open tenders for electrical and mechanical work for the 11-km CBD Belapur-Pendhar metro work on October 7, but the town planning authority extended the deadline to October 30 after few firms showed interest.  After a delay of nearly two months, it is still in process of finalizing the contract for laying tracks, signaling and telecommunication work.  ""We received six bidders for the system work. Of these only three have qualified. Now the process of technical evaluation is underway, after which the agency will carry out financial evaluation,"" said Mohan Ninawe, chief public relations officer, Cidco.  ""Technical evaluation will be completed by December end. And then the process to evaluate financial bid will begin. Finally, after completing the administrative procedures,the contract will be awarded to the qualifying player.""

""Larsen & Toubro, Ansaldo and Alstom are the three players who are in the ring to bag the tender,"" the official added.  The satellite city's first metro railway project was inaugurated by chief minister Prithviraj Chavan in May 2011. The CM then had instructed the town planning authority to complete the project within three years, before 2014.  However, Navi Mumbai residents will have to wait for the first metro ride a little longer as the project will not be completed till 2015.  According to the agency, the metro work is done in four stages - viaduct, station building development, construction of depot and last stage is system work.  Unlike Mumbai, where the metro is being built on a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP), in Navi Mumbai, the Rs 2,000 crore metro rail project is being undertaken by Cidco. The first phase of metro is from Belapur to Pendhar and the agency plans to construct similar rail network of 106km across the satellite city in phases.  ""After the existing metro work, in second phase we plan to connect the proposed Navi Mumbai airport with the metro,"" another Cidco official said.

From bigger and well-established stars like Kumar Mangalam Birla to the rising ones like Sachin Bansal, all shone brighter than ever at the 2013 edition of The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence.  Yet, the leading luminaries had their feet firmly on the ground as they walked away with the awards. Some, even in their moment of fame and acknowledgement of their achievements, remembered the underprivileged.  ""There are three million children who will sleep on the streets today. The wealthier we are, the more we are in a position to make a change,"" said Azim Premji, who received ET's Lifetime Achievement award. The legendary Premji, one of India's wealthiest persons and the country's top philanthropist, spoke about the act of giving at the event, stressing how one cannot mandate philanthropy as it comes from within. ""My biggest regret is to have waited so long to be deeply involved,"" he said.  Seven awards were handed out to some talented achievers, who not only built businesses but are giving shape to a new destiny for the Indian industry.  Kumar Mangalam Birla, who received the Business Leader of the Year award for the second time, said, ""I am not like James Bond, who said, you live only twice. I believe, you live only once and to receive this award twice is a wonderful feeling."" Birla has been credited with transforming the traditional business enterprise into a global conglomerate.  Dilip Shanghvi-controlled Sun Pharma was named Company of the Year while Vinod Khosla was adjudged the Global Indian of the Year. A happy Ashish Hemrajani of BookMyShow took home the Startup of the Year award and a proud A M Naik of Larsen & Toubro walked away with the Corporate Citizen of the Year trophy.  ""As a concept, CSR is ingrained in our DNA and has been part of our value system long before it became largely realized to do so,"" said Naik, while adding: ""There is no short cut. The only way growth is sustainable is when growth is inclusive.""  The ceremony started with Times Group managing director Vineet Jain welcoming the audience that comprised the big guns from the corporate and banking world. In his welcome address, Jain pointed out that all winners honoured by ET ""embody the never-say-die spirit, which forms an important part of the Indian DNA"".  Members of the audience were enthralled by a panel discussion on 'Rebooting India' by a team of panelists comprising Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh, Unique Identification Authority of India chairman Nandan Nilekani, ICICI Bank MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar and Wipro's chief strategy officer Rishad Premji. The discussion clearly set the tone for the evening.  Industry chieftains highlighted that the government should simplify the process of getting licences to attract investment into the country. ""We have to simplify our procedures. In India, we do not know what is black and white, everything is grey,"" remarked Parekh. Kochhar said that one of the reasons for investment and growth slowing down was the ""fear of taking decisions"". The tech gurus, Nilekani and the young Premji, said technology will restructure and redesign industries in the future, similar to how Flipkart changed the retail industry.  It was no surprise then that ET's jury selected Flipkart's Sachin Bansal for the Entrepreneur of the Year award. The 32-year-old battled scepticism and other constraints to build a company in six years which is today valued at $1billion. ""When I started and told my parents about my idea of starting a business, they were apprehensive. They eventually supported me, owing to the fact that I wouldn't let go,"" said Bansal, after accepting the award from finance minister P Chidambaram.  Well, startups do have some advantages as well. As Hemrajani of BookMyShow put it in a lighter vein: ""The good part of gloom and doom is that alcohol sales, ticket sales and medical sales go up. And I think we are in the right industry.""  ""What I love about the startup award is that it almost seems like a lifetime achievement award; we are greying and balding after 15 years of doing this. We can have a 18-year-old's mindset, do creative and disruptive things at work, without the fear of failure and finally not worry about Brooks Brothers and Armani,"" Hemrajani said, adding: ""Bryan Adams knew this was coming and penned the songs exactly for us: '18 till I die' and 'Forever young'.""  What added to the glamour quotient was actor Deepika Padukone, who read out the citations and later mingled with the crowd. Standard Chartered Bank was the presenting sponsor of the awards.

The lawsuit has been brought by New York attorney Krishnan Chittur on behalf of Deepa Shanbhag and 1,500 past and present women employees.  In the lawsuit, which seeks USD 20 million in damages, Shanbhag had alleged that L&T Infotech discriminated against its female employees on the basis of sex with respect to job assignment, compensation and created a ""hostile and abusive climate"" for them.  It alleges that L&T Infotech ""discriminated against her and other employees on grounds of sex and pregnancy"".  It added that the company ""unlawfully or discriminatorily terminated employment of pregnant employees on ""false pretenses.""  Magistrate Judge Patty Shwartz of the District Court in New Jersey allowed the individual claim of intentional sex discrimination, individual and class claims of sex discrimination under New Jersey Law and a class claim of pregnancy discrimination against L&T.  The court also allowed Shanbhag's motion to add Larsen and Toubro Limited as a party to the lawsuit.  Shanbhag, a New Jersey resident, has demanded a jury trial in the case.  Chittur said L&T would now have to ""answer before a jury for its maltreatment of women, and pay these women compensation for what these women had to suffer.""  Shanbhag was hired by the New Jersey-headquartered company as an independent contractor in October 2010 for three months.  The lawsuit said L&T, pleased with Shanbhag's performance, had offered her a full-time position.  Shanbhag joined the company as a full-time employee in January 2011.  However, Shanbhag informed the company in March that she was pregnant.  A day later and only 38 days after Shanbhag joined as a full-time employee, L&T terminated her employment.  During her employment, Shanbhag alleged in the lawsuit, she was repeatedly subjected to an ""unrelenting barrage of sexual harassment"" and criticism of other female employees.  In one instance, Shanbhag's immediate supervisor had told her she was replacing ""a dreadful woman who did not know how to dress.""  The court however dismissed Shanbagh's class claims for pregnancy, sex and hostile work environment and claims for breach of contract.  The court has given L&T time till March 15 to respond. The lawsuit states Shanbhag suffered economic loss, was denied employment benefits and suffered ""mental anguish, humiliation and emotional distress"" due to the company's discriminatory practices.  It says the company should reinstate all those women employees who wish to rejoin and in future should restrain from engaging in any discriminatory practices and customs.

The move comes over three months after gram sabhas in Rayagada and Kalahandi rejected Vedanta's bid to mine Niyamgiri bauxite reserves for its refinery.  On Tuesday, Vedanta group chairman Anil Agarwal following a meeting chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the CM assured bauxite for the company's refinery project at Langigarh in Kalahandi district from L&T's reserves. In the early 1990s, L&T got prospecting licence for Sijimali and Kutrumali mines, with a combined deposit of about 300 million tonne, in Rayagada and Kalahandi districts respectively. But the state government had then denied mining lease (ML) to it on the ground that the company no end-use plant.  L&T's executive chairman A M Naik, who was present at the meeting with CM, said his company had signed an MoU with Vedanta for the Rs 12,000 crore joint venture project.  Official sources said the state government has to recommend to the Centre to give ML in favour of L&T so that bauxite could be sourced from the two mines for Vedanta's refinery. VAL has a smelter plant in Jharsuguda.  Vedanta sources said the company has assured the state government of value addition in the form of alumina and aluminium if bauxite is sourced from Sijimali and Kutrumali through L&T.

""We are building the metro for the city of Hyderabad. The project would not be jeopardized irrespective of whether the state is divided or remains united and the politics surrounding it,"" said V B Gadgil, chief executive and managing director of L&T, while addressing a joint press conference along with NVS Reddy, managing director of Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL).  Asked about the possible loss of revenue and investment due to bifurcation, Gadgil said there is no cause for concern and ruled out conducting a business survey. ""We are certain that Hyderabad would be much more vibrant in future. There is no need to worry about returns on investment,"" added NVS Reddy.  Referring to the reports on excess land given to the project, Gadgil said his company had not received an iota of land which exceeded the requirements. On the contrary, L&T was yet to get 22 acres out of the 212 acres that was allotted for the project, he said.  Clearing the air on the controversy surrounding the allotment of 15 acres of land at Raidurgam and 12 acres at Old Gandhi Hospital to the project as part of the concessionaire agreement, NVS Reddy said the land was given in place of the Osmania University land earmarked for parking and circulation since the university authorities did not agree to part with the land.  Responding to the demand of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) that the metro must go underground near the state assembly building and Sultan Bazaar, Gadgil said the alignment cannot be changed at this stage since the design was finalised much before the biddings were invited.  In an oblique reference to TRS president K Chandrashekar Rao's allegations of irregularities in the land allotment and recruitments of the Metro project, NVS Reddy said he would reach out to all the opposition parties to convince them that there has been no malpractices vis-à-vis the construction of the project.  The project works are progressing at a brisk pace, said Gadgil adding that the first phase of the 7.5 km-long stretch between Nagole and Mettiguda would be thrown open to the public in March 2015 as an 'Ugadi gift'. Works on this stretch would be completed by the end of 2014 following which test runs would be conducted, he added.

""DCNS will invest a little more than Rs 1,350 crore to acquire a significant minority stake in Pipavav Defence,"" one of the persons said. ""They had earlier signed a strategic alliance with Pipavav, but have now decided to be a strategic investor. The stake sale will be completed over the next few days."" A formal announcement is likely soon.  DCNS, owned by the French government, specialises in building surface combatants, submarines, systems and equipment. The company reported revenues of $3.3 billion last year.  ""DCNS recently received in-principle nod from the French government to invest in Pipavav. The deal will be closed by next week,"" another person involved in the deal said. Pipavav's top executives were not available for comment.  SHARES VALUED AT 30% PREMIUM  The deal would value the shares of Pipavav at a premium of 30% to their Friday closing price of Rs 92.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, where it ended down 3.28%. The French company's interest in Pipavav is a sign of the growing interest among foreign players to invest in India's defence sector. Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi has expressed interest in acquiring stake in Larsen and Toubro's shipbuilding subsidiary.  In May, Pipavav had sought shareholders' approval to raise up to $200 million (about Rs 1,100 crore) to finance its growth plans for the defence sector.  Earlier this month, the company had formed a joint venture with Mazagon Dock, the country's biggest naval shipyard. Interestingly, Mazagon Dock had said in February that it was manufacturing six SSK Scorpene submarines (P75) under transfer of technology from DCNS.  According to people in the know, DCNS plans to increase its stake in the Indian firm to 26% by next year and bring in three of its executives on the company board once necessary approvals are in place.  Last month, Pipavav had announced a deal with Saab, under which the Sweden-based defence and security company would invest Rs 201 crore for a 3.5% stake.  Public-private partnership in the defence sector was opened last year, and Mazagon Dock was the first off the block. Three others - Cochin Shipyard, Hindustan Shipyard and Garden Reach Shipbuilders - are expected to follow suit.  Pipavav's deal with Mazagon Dock, notified by the defence ministry recently, will help Pipavav execute at least some of Mazagon's order book, which runs into at least Rs 1 lakh crore. Following the notification, insurance company LIC recently increased its stake in Pipavav to 8.74%.  Indian shipyards contribute only 0.1% to the global shipbuilding industry. In contrast, shipyards in China, Japan and South Korea produce more than 75% of the vessels manufactured globally, forcing Indian shipyards to look for orders from the domestic defence sector.  India has about 150 warships in service with its navy and another 75 warships in Coast Guard.

Also, the registry process of the 1928 flats in the second phase of the project which was earlier scheduled in first week of this month would now begin in middle of October.  Speculations were rife that the construction cost of flats launched in 2010 may increase up to 5% owing to the delay in completion of project. This could have been an excess burden on allottees of Rohini, Betwa, Alaknanda, Rapti, Satlaj, Shipra and Kaveri projects of River View Apartments Phase-II and they would have ended up paying Rs 1-3 lakh more, depending on their flat type. Initial cost of these flats ranged between Rs 22 lakh and Rs 59 lakh, approximately.  The last-minute increase would have also inflated the registration amount. But putting an end to all these rumours, a senior official looking after the project said, ""The authority is currently reviewing River View Phase-II apartments to see if the increase in cost can be mitigated to some extent. We are trying to adjust the increase as much as possible to the comfort of our allottees. Chances are that the cost may not increase at all.""  LDA launched River View Scheme in 2008 in two phases. The first phase started in 2008 offering 1,245 flats. Its registration process began in 2011 and till date 80% buyers already got possession of their flats. For the first time, LDA roped infrastructure giant of international repute Larsen & Toubro to build this project. The project received an overwhelming response because of the popularity of the builders as also for the reasonable costs.  Encouraged by the response, LDA opened the second phase bookings of River View apartments in 2010 which offered 1,000 more flats. People consistently pressed for more flats under this project, hence, after few months, the authority was compelled to launch 928 more flats in the same phase. Due to change in the original plan and repeat in tender formalities, the project took a little longer than usual and got completed in June this year as against the promised deadline of December 2012.  This miffed many who had invested money in the project as they took expensive loans from banks to pay off their dues. Many wanted to shift into the flats on an early basis as they were paying heavy rents for their current accommodation. In June, the project was handed over to the costing department of LDA to assess the financial aspect. The officials found that the project cost had escalated by almost 5.2% which had to be passed on to the allottees. ""The application forms also included a clause stating that the flat cost may vary by 5% after the completion of project and any kind of increase would be borne by the allottee"", said an LDA official.  The costing department had forwarded its recommendations to the LDA VC a few days ago and he has now asked the department to do a cost analysis of each flat afresh. As a result, the registration process of these flats which were earlier scheduled in the first week of October has been postponed till mid October. Meanwhile, lease plans (map of surrounding areas and the location of flat in project) of these flats are being prepared by the town planning department who are daily sending the prepared maps to the property department for attaching them with individual files.

LT,2012-11-09T07:28:00+05:30,"Gaurav Modi,Bakul Chugan Tongia",Worst in 5 years: India Inc stares at dwindling returns,India Business News: Stark numbers suggest India Inc may soon need to choose between betting on newer and more attractive investment avenues.," Five hundred top Indian companies are now staring at dwindling returns - the worst in five years - on the $2.45 trillion of capital they have together invested in their myriad businesses.  Three out of every five companies in the BSE 500 index reported a fall in the return on capital employed (RoCE) in FY12. One out of every three is now earning its worst ROCE in five years, an analysis by the ET Intelligence Group shows.  Put in perspective, the $2.45 trillion capital invested by these 500 companies tot up to 125% of India's GDP. And the average return on these humongous investments has shrunk to 9.3% from the 11.7% earned four years ago.  The stark numbers suggest India Inc is at a cross roads and may soon need to choose between betting on newer and more attractive investment avenues and returning at least some cash to shareholders.  If it chooses neither, it has to live with the new normal of lower returns on capital deployed. ""If current situation is prolonged, diversification may help,"" says Sushil Maroo, Jindal Steel & Power's CFO.  ""However, there is no one-stop solution; it will vary from company to company."" But companies must be cautious in diversifying into more profitable businesses to revive capital efficiency, he adds.  RoCE indicates the returns a company is able to generate out of the total funds it has deployed in the business. It is a measure of a company's profitability and efficiency and should be greater than its cost of capital to make any addition to the shareholders value.   In an environment where cost of both equity and debt capital is rising, any further decline in RoCE would lead to erosion of shareholder value.  Why the fall..  ""ROCEs have fallen over the past few years due to shrinking asset turnovers and a dent in pricing power,"" said Gaurav Mehta, head of strategy, Ambit Capital. ""A record high interest burden has put further pressure on RoEs.""  While falling asset turnover implies inability to service fixed costs, lower pricing power deters companies from adequately passing input cost pressures to end users.  ""Working capital has been rising as a result of increase in input costs since 2008-09 which has bloated the capital employed figures for the companies. Since margins have not increased due to the failure of companies to pass on the entire cost increase to the customers, the RoCE ratios have been falling,"" says Dhananjay Sinha, co-head of institutional research, Emkay Global Companies caught in a pincer created by a greater need for capital and lower returns they are able to earn from it are trying to break free.  Maruti Suzuki, the country's largest passenger carmaker, saw its RoCE dip sharply from 22.5% in FY11 to 13.6%, the lowest in five years. Ajay Seth, CFO, attributes the fall to lower demand and labour strikes which have plagued operations on several occasions in the past 12 months.  ""Our RoCE was at the peak in 2007-08 (30.3%). Since then we have been investing heavily in expanding capacities. Slowdown in the market and production disruptions has led to underutilisation of our capacities. This along with inflation and currency fluctuations has impacted our RoCE,"" said Seth. Maruti has taken steps to improve capital efficiency.  ""Efficient utilisation of capacities and mitigating currency risks by increasing local sourcing of components will reflect in our RoCE over the long term,"" added Seth. Enigneering major Larsen & Tubro also reported its lowest RoCE in five years as investments made in new divisions failed to attract demand.  ""We have made huge investments in power equipment, nuclear power sector, and also in shipyard for venturing into the defence sector. But privatisation of defence is still pending and power generation sector is still very dull which has impacted our RoCE,"" said R Shankar Raman, CFO, Larsen & Toubro.  Apolicy paralysis in the government and weak economic growth prompted companies to hoard cash over the last two years. This also exacerbated the situation as cash generates lower returns than a business's operation thereby reducing RoCE.  Companies might contemplate to pay out excess cash as dividends or use it to buy back shares. But, this again jeopardises their situation as fund raising becomes an expensive proposition in the event of investment opportunity.  he capital goods and real estate sectors were among the most impacted sectors in BSE 500. There were 17 capital goods companies including L&T, BHEL and Crompton Greaves and nine realty companies including HDIL, Unitech and Godrej Properties.  ""These sectors underwent massive capacity expansion during the last decade in anticipation of better demand prospects. However, lower than expected off take failed to justify the higher fixed costs,"" said Sinha of Emkay Global.  The plight seems to be far from over as the risks continue. The pricing power of the companies is still weak and any growth in output will be at the cost of margins. ""In the near term, companies will have lesser incentive to employ additional capital and will be more focussed on restructuring capital,"" said Sinha.

Officials of L&T said people can have a feel of the Metro train as they would BE allowed to checkout the prototype which includes a driver cabin hitched to a passenger coach.  ""The Metro Rail service would be a new mile stone in the public transport history of the city OF Hyderabad which has just completed 400 years this month. And the arrival of the prototype coach is an important phase in the construction of the Metro Rail project. We have chosen October 2 for the inauguration of the public display of the coach since the day also marks Gandhi Jayanthi,"" said a spokesperson of L&T.  While the Korean-based Hyundai-Rotterdam is manufacturing the train coaches, sources said the prototype had already left for India and it is expected to be in Hyderabad anytime next week.  The L&T authorities said they had zeroed-in on a location on the Necklace Road for the public display and it would be a free-entry for the public. The 12 meter-long coach would accommodate over 400 passengers with a sitting arrangement being provide for over 200.  As the project work is progressing, the Hyundai-Rotterdam is said to have been putting the manufacturing of the train coaches on fact track, and the first set of the real train set that consists of an engine and coach is expected in four to six months now, according to the sources.  As per the self-imposed deadline, the L&T authorities said, the first 8-km stretch between Nagole and Mettuguda, on Corridor-III, would be thrown open for the public use in March 2015 coinciding Ugadi celebrations.  Before that, the project must obtain safety clearance from both the Commissioner for Railway Safety, a regulatory body governed by the ministry of civil aviation, and the Research Design and Standard Organisation (RDSO). And VB Gadgil, chief executive and managing director of L&T Hyderbad Metro Rail Limited, said the first stretch would be ready for the test by 2014 December.  A mandatory trial run for over 2000 km has to be conducted before applying for the safety clearance, and Gadgil said the trail run along the viaduct and on the test tracks laid down at Nagole depot would be completed by 2015 February.  He said the rails for the test tracks had already been laid down at Nagole Depot where around 92 per cent of the construction work and 50 per cent of the technical work had been completed, and the laying down of the track on the via duct has just begun. Following the track work, electrification and interiors of the six Metro stations along with the 8-km stretch would be done which includes installation of escalators, lifts, and automatic fare collection system.

While efforts were on to recover the bodies of other sailors, all of whom are feared dead, salvage firms from countries like Norway and Singapore started assessing the mangled submarine. On Saturday, representatives of the firms visited the naval dockyard at Lions Gate and interacted with senior naval officials. Engineering major Larsen and Toubro is also learnt to have voiced interest. ""The Indian Navy does not have the capability to salvage the submarine and very few firms have such expertise. Once these firms assess the situation, we will call in bids. It is not possible to give a deadline for salvage operations to get over,"" said a Navy spokesperson.  Late on Saturday, divers reportedly found the body of a sailor, the sixth to be retrieved so far. The body has been sent to JJ Hospital for DNA analysis and post-mortem.  On Friday, divers prised open the rear escape hatch which was submerged under water and jammed due to high temperatures. ""Opening of the jammed forward escape hatch is also being attempted for an entry to the front portion of the submarine,"" said the Navy in a statement. ""Due to zero visibility within the flooded compartments, divers are searching the submarine interiors by feeling each inch and also marking a probable route to be used for further rescue operations,"" the spokesperson said. Sources said the water around the submarine was still hot.  Salvage operations are quite time consuming and heavy equipment will be required to lift the 2,500-tonne submarine. Norwegian firms took over eight years to salvage the Russian submarine Kursk which sank to the bottom of the seabed in 2000 following an explosion which killed 118 sailors.  The Navy denied that it kept relatives of the sailors in the dark on the search activities. ""We are keeping the relatives informed regularly and have also formed special family support teams of naval officers, sailors and members of the Navy Wives Welfare Association,"" the spokesperson said.  While the five-member board of inquiry under senior submariner Commodore Deepak Bhist has started investigations, sketchy details of the accident have emerged from the three survivors of INS Sindhurakshak. The submarine was scheduled to leave for a patrol on August 14 and the 18 sailors, including the three survivors, were pre-occupied with last-minute checks. Sources said all the six compartments, besides the front and rear escape hatches, were open to facilitate loading of food and other materials inside the submarine.  The survivors are learnt to have told senior Navy officers that loading of ordnance was almost over. The three were standing on the submarine and jetty when they heard the first torpedo explode. ""They turned around to investigate the source of the blast when the second torpedo exploded. One of them got thrown into the water while the other two jumped into the sea,"" said a source.  The trio escaped with burns and was discharged after treatment. A Navy spokesperson said all the three survivors have since rejoined duty at the Naval dockyard.

Independent director of Larsen & Toubro Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Limited, a subsidiary and a special purpose vehicle of the L&T Infrastructure Development Projects, and retired IAS officer Sheila Bhide, recently complained to the government over the inordinate delay in the handing over of 269 acres of land as agreed upon in the agreement. ""Apart from land acquisition, we are facing pressure from several local politicians to allocate subcontracts to parties of their choice,"" said sources in the company.  According to the sources, the land acquisition process is the main reason for L&T having second thoughts about the project. As per the agreement, the Hyderabad Metro Rail Project (HMR), a government body, has to acquire the land for the project and hand it over to L&T . HMR in turn has entrusted the land acquisition job to GHMC. The 71.16 km-long rail project is to be constructed on three corridors, Miyapur-LB Nagar (28.87 km), Jubilee bus Station-Falaknuma (14.78 km) and Nagole-Shilparamam (27.51 km) at a cost of Rs 12,132 crore and L&T bagged it in global bids floated by the state government after the project was cancelled, after Maytas the original promoter went bust post the Ramalinga Raju scam.  But as of date, the land acquisition process has not made any progress in areas including the Purani Haveli Road-Shalibanda stretch in Old City, the Greenlands-Ameerpet-Madhuranagar-Krishna Nagar stretch, Country Club at Greenlands (where a station is supposed to be located), Prakash Nagar, Begumpet (parallel to the old airport flyover), from Punjagutta to Lakdi-ka-pul and Madhapur. “This is not surprisng because the project had been envisioned by Ramalinga Raju as a realtyled one. After it went phut, the government should have reviewed the project and changed the routes. But it did not do so. Everbody knew that there would be land acqusition problems,” an analyst said.  To speed up the land acquisition, the government set up a committee comprising the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) additional commissioner (development planning ) K Dhananjaya Reddy, deputy collector for land acquisition, the executive engineer of the respective corridor and the Hyderabad Metro Rail general manager for land management. But even that has not helped in speeding up the land acquisition process. ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/lt-getting-jittery-over-metro-rail/articleshow/10362367.cms

LT,2013-07-26T04:34:00+05:30,"Namrata Singh,Shubham Mukherjee",Family-run companies better at succession planning,"India Business News: It happened in quick succession. Late last month, PepsiCo India announced that Manu Anand, its India and South Asia president was quitting with immedi","MUMBAI: It happened in quick succession. Late last month, PepsiCo India announced that Manu Anand, its India and South Asia president was quitting with immediate effect. Just a day later, Walmart India announced that its CEO Raj Jain had put in his papers. Both these professionally managed companies, known for their best practices, seemed to have been caught unawares and could announce only an interim CEO, demonstrating in good effect the poor state of succession planning in certain quarters of India Inc.  In contrast, family-run companies have actually shown a better record when it comes to succession planning. At Godrej Consumer Products, a Godrej Group company, CEO transition was smooth when Vivek Gambhir replaced A Mahendran. Similarly, HCL Technologies brought on board Anant Gupta early this year to steer the Shiv Nadar group company with an eye on the future even though existing CEO Vineet Nayar is barely 50. Gupta has very large shoes to fill as Nayar, who continues as vice-chairman, had not only proved to be a successful CEO but also fashioned himself as a management thinker at the global level, opening doors for his company at global corporations. Then for all its hoopla, the selection of Cyrus Mistry as a successor to Ratan Tata through a long-drawn process was perhaps another example of a smooth transition in a family-run empire. Tata himself contributed in good measure by giving Mistry a free hand and by deciding to operate from a different office altogether. Besides, GM Rao of the diversified infrastructure conglomerate, GMR, got a family constitution drafted to deal with matters regarding ownership and power sharing.  Though, there could be a few exceptions (such as Infosys where its founder had to come out of retirement to helm the company), what’s coming out as a broad trend is succession planning in several professionally-run companies has been poor whereas counter-intuitively family-run businesses have actually shown a better track record on this account.  So, when it comes to poor succession planning, HR practitioners love to point fingers at infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro and cigarette-to-hotels major ITC, both headed by two of the most successful business leaders in the corporate world, responsible for the rapid growth of the two companies. At L&T, A M Naik, who is over 70, was given another five-year term through a board mandate. Similarly, 66-year-old Y C Deveshwar at ITC was also given an extension. But people close to him say that this had a lot to do with the fact that the Rs 30,000-crore group was in the midst of a transformation — from being merely a cigarette maker to a diversified conglomerate with some of its new forays into FMCG taking root to bloom. Both ITC and L&T did not comment on the matter. At the global level, experts reserve this mantle for another rock star CEO, John Chambers of Cisco.  “I am not sure whether things generally work better in family businesses, although I am certainly aware of cases such as the Rahul Bajaj and the R P Goenka Groups where succession was effected while the patriarch was very much active. The systematic data that I have seen suggests that at least in other parts of Asia, succession problems may be even worse in family businesses than in non-family businesses,” says Pankaj Ghemavat, management thinker and Anselmo Rubiralta Professor of Global Strategy at IESE Business School, Barcelona.  Boards to blame  A report by management consulting firm Bain suggests that globally, it is the boards which weigh in on decisions such as selecting the CEO, planning succession and even, building the top management team (see graphic). A top CEO, who didn’t want to be identified, suggests that the findings still hold good for India Inc and it’s often the board which is responsible for not taking a clear stand on succession and instead backing continuity. Besides, sometimes larger-than-life CEOs themselves drive boards.  Although there are a couple of general assumptions that people make about family-headed businesses, industry experts believe succession appears to be a smooth affair in a family-run business because the next generation is generally acceptable as a leader. The positive factor that works for a promoter successor is that they can get work done the way they want and that too without much resistance. So when Nisa Godrej, the daughter of group chairman Adi Godrej, wanted to bring about major transformations in the HR processes within the group, there were a few who were skeptical about the same. However, eventually, the changes were endorsed by all. This may have been difficult for an outsider to accomplish.  Sonal Agrawal, managing partner, Accord Group, an executive search firm, believes most MNCs and board-run companies usually have succession planning in place, but sudden situations can catch them unawares. On the other hand, in family-run companies, they usually have a family member earmarked or in training to step up and keep the boat steady in cases of sudden disruptions or death.  A good option  All leaders may not agree with this but there is a sense of insecurity that a CEO may harbour on the idea of grooming a strong successor. A senior official at a consumer products company says most leaders would feel threatened to create a strong second contender to the leadership position, who could succeed him anytime. Rather, companies, he felt, should look at creating a strong second bench of managers who could take on a leadership role as and when the need arises. ICICI under K V Kamath had that kind of a bench and was one instance of savvy planning in a professional set-up. Only when there is clarity on when a leader is leaving the organization can a successor be groomed to take on that role. Else, such a situation can create uncertainty for the existing leader.  Globally, celebrated CEOs such as Jack Welch, Lee Iacocca were self-assured and wanted to leave a legacy behind. They worked hard to build a next generation of leaders with the knowledge that their brand will stay only as long as the company they leave behind is successful. The legacy issue often enables such leaders, including GE’s Jeff Immelt, to plan better for succession.

This has been necessitated since is because the three main contractors have not provided such details. The labour department requires this information in case of accidents at work sites involving labourers.  The over Rs 5,000-crore project is being implemented to a large extent largely through sub-contractors. While the DMRC only deals directly with the three main contractors - Larsen and Toubro (L&T), Soma Constructions and Era Infa Engineering Ltd - it does ""not keep track of sub-contractors"" involved in the construction of Metro. According to the labour department, only one sub-contractor has so far registered with them and they have no clue about the others involved in the construction. They do not even have figures of the number of workers involved.  Though sub-contracts are an accepted practice in the construction industry, both the principal employer and contractors have to register with the department. The labour department has decided to issue notice to the main contractors asking them to register with it and provide details on sub-contractors. It also claimed that since the Metro is a public sector undertaking, the project owner, Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL), was the principal employer. The Metro agency has to ensure their contractors are registered with the department.  While activities like conducting surveys, soil testing, chopping of trees, road widening and the like are done by sub-contractors, works such piling are generally executed by main contractors.  According to DMRC, when works that cost above Rs 50 lakh are awarded to sub-contractors, they have to be informed. ""In the case of Kochi Metro, contractors such as L&T are involved in executing main works. Sub-contracts are the responsibility of main contractors and they have to ensure the quality of work undertaken by these agencies,"" said a DMRC spokesperson.  The Metro authority reiterated that irrespective of all contracts, they were responsible and accountable for safety measures adopted at construction sites.

Subways at Malad and Andheri and the Milan subway at Santa Cruz were also affected. Both the Eastern and Western Express Highways were clogged till 1pm. While the stretch between Malad and Andheri on the WEH was affected, the EEH was jammed from Cadbury junction in Thane to the Mulund flyover. Authorities sent text messages to motorists and also made announcements through radio channels about the situation.

The company had posted a net profit of Rs 863.65 crore during the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.  Net sales grew 5 per cent to Rs 12,555.06 crore during the quarter from Rs 11,956.35 crore in Q1 of 2012-13, it said in a filing to the BSE.  L&T shares, which opened higher in the morning, fell about 7 per cent on the BSE immediately after the results announcement.  The stock traded at Rs 903 apiece on the BSE at 1508 hours, down 7.36 per cent from the previous close. Market men said the results were disappointing, particularly the growth in revenue and order book.  The company's revenue was impacted by a 44 per cent fall in the power business segment at Rs 1,274.94 crore and an almost 18 per cent fall in the metallurgical and material handling business at 1,086.92 crore.  In a separate statement, the company said both businesses had a lower order book due to a slowdown in the sectors.  Other income, primarily interest earned on deposits, fell by over 22 per cent to Rs 472.60 crore compared with Rs 608.12 crore in Q1FY'13.  L&T's other businesses did well. Revenue from the infrastructure business reported a growth of almost 22 per cent at Rs 5,460.81 crore, while in the hydrocarbon business, it was up 24 per cent at Rs 2,776.33 crore.

It added that the recent government measures on FDI, reduction in oil and power subsidy and on facilitating investments are expected to bear fruit in the medium term.

The ministry of defence (MoD) sources on Tuesday clarified that the JV “will not be given any special privileges” and would not get any “backdoor entry”. This means that the JV would not be given any “orders on a nomination basis”. A senior MoD official said even when MDL “has to offload work it has to be done through competitive bidding”.  However, the JV can jointly bid for any of the contracts from the MoD, he said.  The MoD clarification means that the much-touted JV would be just another company, and would not enjoy any special status. Nor would it benefit from the about Rs 100,000 crore ship-building contracts that MDL is expecting from the Navy and the Coast Guard over the next two decades.  The JV had been mired in controversy because of various allegations regarding its formation not following norms governing formation of JVs between defence PSUs and private companies. The MoD carried out an inquiry based on media reports, complaints from other private shipyards and others.  The new guidelines for the JV are based on MoD inquiry’s findings, sources said.  Hence, the original intention behind the proposal to set up JVs between defence PSUs and private companies as a means to offload work pending with the DPSUs has been defeated. Sources said the same rules would govern all other JVs that MDL will now ink. Larsen & Toubro and ABG Shipyard are among those who have been discussing similar JVs with MDL.

LT,2013-07-09T06:52:00+05:30,Ajanta Chakraborty,Parama flyover to miss Dec deadline,The Mamata Banerjee government has fixed a post-Puja deadline for starting the construction work for the Park Circus-Parama Island flyover to commence," KOLKATA: The Mamata Banerjee government has fixed a post-Puja deadline for starting the construction work for the Park Circus-Parama Island flyover to commence in full swing. It has also found a way to wriggle out of the red-tape, that has stalled the construction of the city's longest flyover, by asking RITES to step in.  The crucial project under Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), which was scheduled to be completed by August 2012, has now missed its revised deadline of August, 2013. There is no way it can meet its second amended deadline of December 2013.  And now, RITES has been assigned to conduct a technical and cost escalation study of the Rs 300-crore flyover - addressing the hurdle areas which made construction major Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) submit an enhanced bill of Rs 226.52 crore to the government.  The public sector company, run by the railways, will also go through the design which was changed due to the brick sewerage beneath the flyover. RITES is expected to submit its report by July 31 and the state Cabinet may clear the recommendations by September so that work can commence by October-end.  While a board meeting of the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), the project implementing agency, has cleared the enhanced cost, the finance department has refused to pass it because the contractors had to abide by the original cost of Rs 300 crore and a new tendering process must be initiated to accommodate the steep hike of 70%. That, too, justifying the increase. The cash-strapped Bengal government approached the Centre, but was told that it wasn't liable to bear any additional cost incurred due to delay.  In order to justify the cost overrun, the state secretariat Writers' Buildings then set up a five-member committee led by the PWD secretary. Things were further complicated when this committee recently estimated the cost at Rs 201 crore and not Rs 226.52 crore as claimed by HCC.  To get out of the muddle, the government has now appointed Rites to conduct a separate study, arrive at a ""more acceptable"" cost escalation and have HCC abide by the reduced cost.  ""After conducting the study and arriving at a reduced escalation based on amended technicalities, the job of RITES will be to convince the contractors to agree to the price fixed by the agency. All along, HCC will be in the loop so that the two agencies could arrive at a consensus over the enhanced cost,"" state urban development minister Firhad Hakim told TOI. ""Provided everything works out according to the government's plans, full-fledged work for the flyover should begin after the Pujas,"" the minister added.  Documents with TOI revealed that KMDA has explained the reason for HCC missing the August 11, 2012 deadline, saying: ""The time overrun has been caused partly due to lack of progress on the part of HCC and partly due to non-availability of work front to HCC."" The documents also read: ""More than 50% of the work front could not be handed over to HCC because utility structures couldn't be shifted. A budgeted cost of Rs 317.92 crore was sanctioned for the 8.14-km flyover in January 2009 with a 30 months' deadline, but work began only in February 2010.""  KMDA, therefore, is willing to bear the cost overrun. It plans to provide the funds by selling some of its property. ""The government clearly wants HCC to finish the flyover at the enhanced cost of Rs 544 crore instead of Rs 318 crore. It's true that the contractor is not entirely to be blamed for the delay. But rules are rules and the government must abide by them,"" said a senior official at the Writers' Buildings.  ""Therefore, the government has instituted another survey by RITES, to allow HCC execute the project. It must ensure that the work commences immediately,"" added the official.  Meanwhile, another cost overrun looms. This one relates to the 600-metre stretch of the flyover (between Darga Road and Topsia intersection) that will cross the rail tracks, parallel to Bridge No 4. Larsen and Toubro has just started the piling work for the rail over-bridge after railways gave the permission last week. The work is eight months behind schedule since L&T got its work order in October, last year.

But Abhay Kadam (21), son of an auto rickshaw driver, felt there was more to life than taking up the offer and climbing up the corporate ladder.   Today, Kadam is among the chosen few selected for commission in the Indian Army, a career path seldom trodden by youngsters from the financial capital. Of the 1.49 lakh candidates who took the Combined Defence Services exam, 239 were picked after a round of an examination and medical test conducted by the UPSC. And Abhay is beside himself with excitement at the opportunity he has got to watch life on the line, to be present there to tell the real cost of a war and the price of peace. “How do I explain the thrill I feel to be able to serve the country, without sounding dramatic or fake ?” he said. It is probably only natural that Abhay made the choice. “My grandfather and great-grandfather were both jawaans in the Maratha infantry,” he said.  But taking the final decision was not easy for Abhay, who kept dreaming of a “bright future”. Every evening, as his father walked home, after dropping off his rented auto at the owner’s place with the day’s earnings, Abhay pondered on how to make it big in life, how to free his family from the cycle of the Rs-9,000-a-month income.  “Abhay initially wanted to join the merchant navy, which pays handsomely. But when he joined the NCC and interacted with officers, he was attracted to the uniform,” said his trainer, Rtd Lt Col Pradeep Brahmankar. Abhay is a Naval wing NCC cadet and has done his NCC ‘C’ certificate in ‘B’ grade. His only possession from those days is a bronze medal he won in the 1,200-m race in college. Abhay is now filled with an overwhelming sense of satisfaction as he looks at his selection letter and remembers his life so far—his schooldays, the time he spent at B N Bandodkar College in Thane, his small tenement with paints peeling off its walls. “A chapter is over. Another one will begin. I am ready for it.”  ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/auto-drivers-son-leaves-it-job-for-army/articleshow/20722700.cms

Even as the markets remain volatile resulting in a poor appetite for stocks, companies are showering investor","CHENNAI: It's raining bonus shares for investors. Even as the markets remain volatile resulting in a poor appetite for stocks, companies are showering investors with bonus shares. Nearly a dozen companies including blue-chip ones have announced bonus shares in the past one month.  While engineering behemoth Larsen & Toubro has recommended a 1:2 (one bonus share for two shares held) to commemorate its platinum jubilee, Sun Pharmaceuticals has proposed a 1:1 bonus on completion of 30 years and crossing the $2-billion revenue milestone. In all, five companies would be allotting bonus shares within the next 10 days. Companies usually build reserves by retaining part of their profits that is not paid as dividend. When free reserves increase, companies transfer a portion of it into the capital account, which is then used to issue bonus shares. Only fully paid-up shares are eligible for bonus.  Market observers believe that bonus shares are being given to improve liquidity and arrest the free fall in stock prices. The share price of the company gets adjusted according to the bonus ratio. For instance, if the share price of the company is Rs 200 before the bonus and it issues bonus shares in the 1:1 ratio, the post-bonus price would be Rs 100. The total market value of the company would, however, remain the same.  ""This is being done to improve liquidity (of the stock). Bonus shares also improve the perception about the (issuing) company,"" said Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Shares and Securities. Kishor P Ostwal, MD, CNI Research, an equities research provider, said, ""There is a perception that bonus issue will arrest the free fall in share prices.""  But the momentum offered by bonus issue announcements has been a short-lived one. Share prices of companies that gave bonus shares, which spurted to their 52-week highs after the announcement, have started to decline. While FMCG firm Emami's stock has lost 9.9% since hitting its 52-week high on May 27, the Torrent Pharmaceuticals stock has dropped 2.8% from its yearly high hit on June 3.  Some observers also attribute the rise in bonus share issuances to the uncertain economic environment. ""Companies with high cash on their balance sheets are not going for expansion. They are also not investing in new projects because of the uncertainty,"" said Vikram Dhawan, director, Equentis Capital.  Bonus shares are typically given by companies with strong fundamentals. Since a bonus issue increases the number of outstanding shares, companies have to increase profits considerably to maintain their earnings per share, observers said.

According to sources, when a delegation met HMRL managing director NVS Reddy, he assured that the demand would be fulfilled. Reddy told them that the project would generate about 50,000 direct and indirect jobs. and that they would not have any hesitation in reserving 80% of it for the people of Telangana  The delegation that met NVS Reddy included TRS Siddipet MLA T Harish Rao, politburo member Sravan Kumar Dasoju and MLCs Swamy Goud and Mahmood Ali besides TJAC leaders Srinivas Goud and Addanki Dayakar.  The team reminded the metro rail officials of the AP Public Employment (Organization of Local Cadre and Regulation Direct Recruitment Order- 1975) Act, also known as Presidential Order 1975, which reserves 80% of government jobs to locals. ""We explained the provision of the Act and also warned of an agitation in case our demand is not met. Responding positively to our demand, NVS Reddy said that of the total estimated 50,000 jobs, 40,000 would be reserved for locals.""  However, according to a senior official in the municipal administration department, the TRS delegation approached the wrong party in seeking an assurance on job reservation as the Hyderabad Metro Rail authorities have no say in the matter. ""The metro rail project is an infrastructure project being executed under public private partnership (PPP), and Larsen & Toubro is the concessionaire for the project. HMRL has no role in the recruitment because L&T has given the operation and maintenance (O&M) contract to Keolis, a France-based public transport operator, which would hire people in consultation with the concessionaire,"" said the official.  According to the official, HMRL has got it wrong with regard to the number of jobs that the project is expected to generate. ""In reality, the number of employees required , including construction and operation, is around 20,000. The inflated number being assured by the metro rail authorities can later lead to unrest among the local people apart from misleading the public,"" said the official.

The finance company, floated by engineering giant Larsen & Toubro (L&T), is seen by many to be a front-runner for a bank licence, given that the financial services business fits in with most of RBI's prescriptions and there is nothing that disqualifies the company from being a bank licence hopeful.  Addressing newspersons after the results, N Sivaraman, president & wholetime director, said that the company had ambitions for setting up a bank as it was a natural evolution of its financial service business. ""A bank licence is a very valuable opportunity to acquire clients and retain them rather than sell single products. It is a very strategic opportunity,"" he said.  The challenges for an existing finance company to convert into a bank is to meet prudential guidelines in terms of maintaining the required cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio. Also, new private sector banks will be subject to priority sector targets from day one.  LTFH has built up an agri and rural portfolio which will enable it meet its priority sector targets if it gets a banking licence. It would, however, have to open several new offices in rural and unbanked segments if it is allowed to transition its existing business into a bank.  LTFH posted a net profit of Rs 174.1 crore in the fourth quarter - a growth rate of 23.8% over the corresponding quarter. The firm's loan and advances increased by 30% to Rs 33,000 crore in the period under review, while core interest income rose 30.4% to Rs 651.1 crore. Profits were constrained by delinquency costs, high cost of funds and losses from investment management business.  LTFH ventured into the business of wealth management in FY12 through the induction of senior industry executives. Subsequently, L&T Capital Markets (LCM) has been incorporated as a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary of LTFH to support the wealth management business. LCM has a dedicated set of research professionals along with senior private bankers and offers a comprehensive portfolio of services which includes private wealth management, financial advisory (including offshore) and capital market related businesses.

An apex court bench of Justice R M Lodha, Justice J Chelameswar and Justice Madan B Lokur partly heard petitions filed by Larsen & Toubro, the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry and the Builders' Association of India against the levy by Karnataka and Maharashtra governments. The hearing will continue tomorrow.  The organizations, in their petitions, have questioned the state governments' constitutional power to levy VAT on under-construction flats where stamp duty has been paid. They have also questioned whether a developer-flat buyer agreement signed under respective state Acts such as the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA) constitutes a works contract.  In L&T's case, in 2008, it was asked to pay tax under the Karnataka Sales Tax (KST) Act, 1957. The company argued that it had signed a development agreement, to develop the plot belonging to the owner.  The KST department, though, relied on an earlier 2006 apex decision in the case of K Raheja developers on a similar works contract issue. The department said the company had signed a tripartite agreement with the plot owner and prospective flat buyers. As the agreement involved constructing flats for the buyers, the department said, it is a works contract and, therefore, VAT was leviable.  This view was opposed by L&T and subsequently by other developer bodies such as MCHI, which pointed to the difference between sale and works contracts. They said in a sale contract, a developer or a plot owner themselves develop a property and sell flats or commercial complexes. In such activities, no works contract was involved. They also argued in the agreement, there was a clause that if all payments are not made, then amounts paid can be forfeited and the agreement rescinded. No such right has been given to a person carrying out a works contract. ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sc-hears-pleas-against-state-power-to-levy-vat/articleshow/18941562.cms

The debarment will continue till September 6, making L&T ineligible for being awarded contracts for any World Bank- funded projects, from receiving any loan proceeds made by the bank or participating in any bank-financed project.  The sanction order, dated March 7, said that L&T's ineligibility would continue across the entire World Bank group and has been imposed on L&T ""for fraudulent practices"" as per the bank's Procurement Guidelines against Fraud and Corruption.  During the debarment period, L&T as well as any of the entities controlled directly or indirectly by it can't be nominated even subcontractor, consultant, manufacturer, supplier or even service provider to an otherwise eligible firm being awarded a World Bank-financed project.  The matter pertains to a bid submitted by L&T through Regional Business Head of its Medical Equipment and Systems unit to a World Bank-financed project in Tamil Nadu.  In January 2005, the World Bank Group had entered into a Development Credit Agreement with the Indian government to provide 110.83 million dollars of International Development Association credit for the Tamil Nadu Health Systems Project.  It was set up to improve the effectiveness of health systems in the state by increasing access to critical health services for poor, disadvantaged and tribal groups.  In July 2008, bidding documents were issued by Tamil Nadu Medical Service Corporation for a contract to supply 130 ultrasound scanners under the Project, following which L&T submitted a bid on September 3, 2008 through the said Regional Business Head.  Upon technical and financial evaluation, L&T's bid was found to be the lowest-priced, but a complaint was received later that some of the certificates submitted with the bid might have been forged.  The bid contained a total 115 performance certificates purportedly issued by medical facilities stating that the ultrasound scanners supplied by L&T were working well.  After the company was asked to explain, the Regional Business Head said that some medical facilities may have mistakenly denied issuing the certificates and requested that L&T ""not be viewed as (having) indulged in fraudulent practice"".  In December 2008, L&T was informed that the tender has been cancelled and the contract was awarded to another firm through a new bidding process.  After looking into the matter, the World Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) alleged that L&T ""engaged in fraudulent practices by submitting forged performance certificates with its bid"".

After several years in the public and private sector, Oursel became president and CEO of Areva NP in 2007 and was named president and CEO in 2011, as also chairman of the executive board of Areva. He also serves as the chairman of French nuclear society. The 8.8-billion-euro Areva, which supplies solutions for power generation and has manufacturing facilities in 43 nations, is now also expanding operations to renewable energies: wind, solar, bioenergies, hydrogen and storage. The group has a diversified portfolio of mines, which guarantees supply of uranium to customers besides producing gold through its subsidiary La Mancha. Given the volatile nature of nuclear power business, which divides stakeholders, governments and the public into distinct groups, he spoke to TOI about a range of issues, including those around making nuclear energy more acceptable, the outlook for N-power and the Indian business environment.  Excerpts...  What is the outlook of nuclear energy business post Fukushima?  It’s been nearly two years after Fukushima and we can say interest for nuclear option is confirmed. The forecast is that nuclear capacity will grow in the world until 2030. And why? Simply because nuclear power is available at a competitive cost. Nuclear power has predictable costs and is independent of the variation in fossil fuel prices. It is clear that nuclear power is a local energy and preserves energy independence, which is a target for many countries. Besides, it contributes to CO2 emission reductions, which I think in the long term remains the necessary target for all countries. So, globally the prospect of nuclear energy remains very good but under certain number of conditions.  What is the progress in India?  We knew that (French President Francois) Hollande’s trip was a very important milestone in the discussion. When you start working with a country you start creating relationships for decades. What we have done with NPCIL (Nuclear Power Corporation of India) is totally backed and supported by our governments. The statements both by the Indian prime minister and Mr Hollande confirm that there is a common will to conclude the negotiations quickly. This was also an opportunity for me to meet our colleagues from NPCIL and review where we are and it is clear that we have made significant progress.  What are you doing to deal with the protests and for public acceptance of the project in Jaitapur (Maharashtra)?  It is NPCIL’s responsibility to explain to the Jaitapur population about this project and to present it as the operator of the future plants. Our contribution in this case is to provide NPCIL with as many elements as needed of the technical characteristics of the plant and the safety features of the plant. This plant can resist airplane crashes. This plant has a certain number of equipment to guarantee safety in case there is no power.  When do you expect to sign the financial agreement for the project?  Financial discussions are not separate as they are part of the global discussion to come to a contract. They are progressing well. The objective of these discussions now is to come quickly to the signing of an early work agreement to start engineering studies. These engineering studies are necessary to prepare in an optimal way the project and also to check the capability of Indian suppliers. And in the second step, we will have the final signature of the full contract. I remain confident that this is an objective which can be reached within some months this year.  How do you view the Indian business environment?  Our experience of the Indian business environment is on the nuclear and renewables. Our experience for the moment is mainly to deal with preparatory activities. We have developed contacts with many Indian companies to evaluate their capabilities. That means if we select some partners for our Indian project, they will become part of our global supply chain. For the renewables project, we are building a solar plant in Rajasthan. We hope to start this plant this year. We are building this plant with Reliance. I wouldn’t say we have experienced any major business issues. We found solutions quite easily.  What are your views about Indian vendors, engineers?  We build nuclear plants but we also organize logistics for nuclear fuel. For the logistics, we use a certain number of special containers. These containers are manufactured here with Larsen & Toubro. So we have concrete practical experience of cooperation with Indian suppliers and we are quite satisfied with the result. They can fulfill the high standards of nuclear activities. We have had the same experience for engineers working for renewables and solar activities.

While it has totally done away with the 'two corridor' concept and instead recommended a dense network of Metro connectivity in the city, the entire route has been proposed to be built overhead to save cost. Government sources told TOI that the revised route can reach even to the interiors of the city.  Interestingly, the report has proposed the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) as a feeder to the Metro rail as and when it is built. These would have dedicated corridors for plying of buses on an elevated platform. An official told TOI, ""A BRTS can only function on a road which is more than 30 metres wide like we have in Ahmadabad. Unfortunately in Lucknow, most of the roads are narrower hence we have proposed elevated corridors for BRTS implementation.""  Cost of building an elevated platform for BRTS would require around Rs 50 crore per kiloemtre. Justifying their proposal, the officials said: ""Building a BRTS all over the city on an elevated track would be very expensive thus defeating the purpose, hence we have suggested it as feeder to the metro.""  As far as the financial model for the metro project is concerned, the report does not recommend any one specific way. There could be two ways for financing the project - one is through 'viability gap funding' which involves 20%cost bearing by the Central government and another 80% percent by the state itself. Another alternative is PPP (public private partnership) model, which is being successfully operated in Hyderabad (tie-up with Larsen and Toubro) and Mumbai (with Reliance).  The report enlists pros and cons of both these models and suggests that Lucknow can operate one any one of these. However, sources confirmed that two Central agencies -- Planning Commission and Union urban development ministry - were not unanimous on selecting the financial model for Lucknow. While Planning Commission is proposing PPP model, the ministry is rooting for viability gap funding for Lucknow Metro.  Now that the state urban planning department report has made a lot of changes to the original plan, the government is likely to take some time to have a relook at the project. Officials said that the revised route would now require the DPR (detailed project report) on metro to be prepared afresh, which means starting from the scratch again. Interestingly, LDA sources have been rooting for PPP model. An official said, ""In cities like Mumbai and Hyderabad, big companies have been sharing cost burden with the government. Normally, the project is given on BOT (build, operate and transfer) mode for 35 years. There are added benefits for companies involved in such projects where they are allowed to make profit out of the surrounding real estate projects.  A day before, LDA had hinted that all major activity centers which have good potential for passengers like schools, colleges, educational institutes, hospitals, multispecialty healthcare units, bus stations, railways stations, important offices would be covered with the proposed Metro network. On Tuesday, when the state budget was announced, the special committee appointed to review Metro project submitted final report to the CM. Officials claim that their report is much more extensive and relevant than the previous report as they have studied even the minutest of technicalities and its adaptability to the city.  The overall cost is bound to go up as the metro coverage has expanded, confirmed sources. However, now the entire track would be made overhead to reduce per km cost. Cost of constructing one km of overhead track is just Rs 180 crore while for underground it reaches up to Rs 550 crore. It consumes much more energy and is safety is also an issue.

Chief minister Oommen Chandy had announced that the 10km stretch of the national highway between Puthiyatheru and Thazhe Chowwa will be widened after the Chala mishap on August 27.  Government had also sanctioned Rs 10 crore for the widening of the road.  ""But even after more than five months, nothing has happened other than demolishing the dividers at Chala, because we lack the political will to break the red-tapism,"" said a senior PWD official who did not want to be named.  According to sources, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is not interested to widen this road as the bypass project is likely to start soon.  But it will take a few years before the NH bypass becomes a reality and even if it comes up the Puthiyathrru - Thazhe Chowwa stretch will remain as busy as ever because these are the main entry and exit points to the town.  However, the municipal authorities said some road development projects are underway.

IIM-A governing council chairman A M Naik said that proposed legislation to bring IIMs under an umbrella body, would slow down institute's effort to take it to the next level of globalisation.  The proposed legislation seeks to confer the IIMs the status of institutes of national importance empowering them to award degrees instead of diplomas and establishment of an IIM Council similar to the Council for the IITs and pave way for appointment of more government directors in IIMs boards.  The premier B-school has started the fight for its autonomy to preserve the status that it has created for itself, when there have been attempts by successive governments to bring it under governmental control.  ""We demand options for institutes...to all IIMs whether to come under the government umbrella and give a degree...or those who want to remain autonomous as they are and shall not give degrees and continue with what they are giving today (diploma),"" Naik, who is also the Managing Director of Larsen and Toubro, told PTI.

GMR Infrastructure has pulled out of NHAI's biggest road project being set up at a cost of 7,700 crore for the six-lane Udaipur-Kishangarh-Ahmedabad segment of the national highway, citing land acquisition, environmental clearance and toll notification as some of the issues.  A senior executive of L&T, who heads the engineering, procurement and construction business, told ET that the company has not received any official communication from GMR and the order continues to be on its books. Analysts and sector officials, however, fear that cancellation is imminent, given GMR's decision to not go ahead with the project. ""The issue is between our client GMR and NHAI and we hope they will be able to sort it out. As of now, we have the project in our order book and we will wait and watch,"" SN Subrahmanyan, whole-time director and senior executive vice president of the firm's infrastructure & construction division, told ET.  NHAI is believed to be planning to take action against GMR for non-compliance with procedure for exiting a project.  In 2011, GMR Infrastructure had bagged NHAI's biggest project, the Kishangarh-Udaipur-Ahmedabad highway, by quoting an aggressive premium of 636 crore. The winning bid had raised quite a few eyebrows then with analysts speculating the viability of the project, considering the premium.  Subsequently, GMR placed two orders with L&T in December 2011 and August 2012 totalling 2,809 crore for construction of the road project, which are now likely to be cancelled. A GMR spokesperson declined to comment on whether they have officially terminated the order to L&T.  ""The GMR road project will be knocked out of L&T's order book. This order accounts for around 2% of the order book, so there would be some negative impact, especially because some other orders are moving slow,"" said Ankush Mahajan, research analyst with Mumbai-based KR Choksey.

Steel and mines minister Rajanikant Singh said he had asked the collector of Dhenkanal to probe into the deaths and submit a report soon.  This coincided with the assembly's public accounts committee, headed by leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh, warning the Bhusan Steel Limited (BSL) at Kantabania in Dhenkanal district to take immediate safety measures for welfare of labourers working with it.  On Sunday, four persons died and three others were seriously injured in a LPG gas cylinder explosion at L&T colony located inside BSL's project area. For construction works, BSL has hired Larsen & Toubro (L&T), which in turn has engaged a firm named R S Engineering. The deceased labourers, who hailed from Jharkhand, as well as the injured workers were employed by R S Engineering. The condition of the injured, who have burn injuries, is stated to be critical.  The incident took place when the workers were cooking food at about 7 am in their room. The LPG gas cylinder exploded, killing three of them on the spot. Another succumbed to his injuries at SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack.  Singh at a review meeting held at Dhenkanal said the labourers died due to lack of safety measures and blamed the company of not taking proper care of the workers. He said Contract Labour Act provides for health care, canteen provisions, safe drinking water and other welfare provisions, but such facilities were absent for the laborers here.  There are more than 7000 workers living in the colonies built for the workers here, he pointed out, adding the firm had accommodated too many persons in a small room, leading to the tragedy. The committee will submit its report on the issue during the next assembly session, Singh added.

Ending the four-day rally, the Sensex closed 92.66 points down, or 0.47%, to 19,691.42 led by stocks of capital goods and realty, while a rise in auto and metal stocks capped the losses.  The Index had gained 358 points in the last four trading sessions.  The wide-based National Stock Exchange index Nifty lost 27.75 points, or 0.46%, to 5,988.40.  Brokers said the market remained under pressure as cautious investors indulged in profit-booking from recent star performers, while energy stocks rose on expectations of hike fuel prices.  They said a weakening trend in the Asian region and lower opening in Europe led investors to reduce their positions before any technical correction.

""It is only a matter of a few months and clearances of certain plans by some specific agencies. If everything goes as per our plan then PCPIR will take off by the year end,"" Kona Sadidhar, vice-chairman of the special development authority (SDA) of VK-PCPIR told TOI.  The vice-chairman confirmed that the initial meeting with stakeholders such as farmers, fishermen, artisans and industry has been completed and the draft master plan has been submitted to the government for suggestions and objections. The zonal development plan is also ready and has been given to SDA for approval.  The proposed region is being jointly designed by Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (Vuda) and the specially created SDA and will cover an extent of 603 square kilometres from Visakhapatnam to Kakinada.  According to Sasidhar, the task of preparing the environment impact assessment (EIA) and environment management plan (EMP) has been assigned to Hyderabad-based Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI). ""Once the EIA and EMP report is over, we will submit them to the ministry of environment and forests (MOEF) for clearance and call for a public hearing. The entire plan has been designed by Canada-based consultancy firm Lee Associates,"" he said.  A nine-member team of experts from the SDA had visited both Rotterdam in Netherlands and Sarnia in Canada a couple of months ago to study the design and impact of PCPIRs and it is expected that a similar plan would be replicated.  Speaking on the highlights of the plan, Sasidhar said that an expressway is being planned exclusively for the PCPIR from Visakhapatnamt to Kakinada, linking the three important ports-Visakhapatnam Port Trust, Gangavaram Port Limited and Kakinada Port. Since the region is going to be shore-based, the linking of ports for logistics purposes is important.  On the objections raised by Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and Eastern Naval Command on the expressway, he said, ""The objection from the navy has been sorted out as we have decided to skirt the navy's new alternate base (NAOB) at Rambilli. With the VSP we are negotiating and it will be sorted out shortly.""  Since the PCPIR is going to be shore-based, the plans include construction of a number of fishermen and coastal jetties along the route. ""The coastal jetties will serve as inland waterway for the tenants and we will build about 52 fish modern landing centres to serve the fisherfolk along the route. We realised that 30 per cent of the population comprises of fishermen and we need to do something for them. We have proposed an additional Rs 3,000 crore for their development to the Central government,"" he informed.  Coming to the most crucial factor of anchor tenants, he said that the initial talk of HPCL-ONGC and GMR being the main tenants is doubtful. ""But we are not ruling them out and neither have they expressed their total unwillingness. The talks are still on. It is a matter of policy decision and the respective boards are in touch with the ministries concerned. But at the same time we are negotiating with a refinery in Kuwait and USA for being anchor tenants. Once the anchor tenants are finalised, the ancillary units will follow,"" he said.  On other highlights of the plan, he said there was a proposal to set up research centres and knowledge hubs for industry-academia interface. ""We are in talks with various universities such as AU and JNTU-Kakinada for this. The plan also has elaborately dealt with the farming community and we intend to educate and motivate the farmers to grow crops that would suit the industry such as bio-diesel farming,"" he explained.  According to a survey done by Larsen and Toubro the projected investment could go up to Rs 3.6 lakh crore and employment generation could touch 12 lakh in the PCPIR. The investment on infrastructure is to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore, with Rs 11,000 crore coming from public-private partnerships, Rs 5,000 crore from the Central government, Rs 2,500 crore from the state government and the rest from other investors. ""With things moving in the right direction we intend to tap the Central government funds in the next six months,"" Sasidhar said.

Stocks of companies that were keen on banking licence, including Reliance Capital and Larsen & Toubro Finance Holdings, closed more than 4% higher. Others such as M&M Finance and Shriram Transport Finance were up in intra-day trade but closed almost flat. Although the government has been nudging RBI to issue a few bank licences to corporate houses, the central bank has been holding back on the grounds that the centre should first enact amendments to the Banking Regulation Act giving more powers to the central bank.  Among other things the amendments will give RBI the power to supersede bank boards. It will also allow the central bank to inspect books of conglomerates that have a bank in their group. Once the amendments are in force any potentially large investor in a bank will need to take RBI permission before buying shares.  While Banking Regulation Bill raises hopes for NBFCs, there are also new regulatory challenges. RBI has issued new prudential norms based on recommendations of a committee headed by Usha Thorat. The new norms require NBFCs to have a tier-one capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 12% by April 2014. At present, the tier-I requirement is 7.5% for NBFCs except those in infrastructure where it is 10% and for those lending against gold where it is already 12%.  Non-banking finance companies are also required to adhere to the same norms as banks for classifying an advance as a bad loan. At present , if a borrower does not repay a loan for 180 to 360 days the advance has to be classified as a bad loan compared to 90 days for banks. “It has been decided that the asset classification and provisioning norms should, in a phased manner, be made similar to that of banks for all registered NBFCs irrespective of size. The same will be implemented in phases, viz; a 120-day norm shall be applied from April 01, 2014 to March 31, 2015 and a 90-day norm thereafter. A one-time adjustment of the repayment schedule which shall not amount to restructuring will, however, be permitted,” RBI said.

While 10 globally renowned companies have already conducted campus interviews in the premier institute in the past two months, at least five others are scheduled to visit in the coming weeks.  Finisar, a fiber optic subsystems technology provider, has offered around Rs 12.5 lakh annual package to a couple of students. Flipkart (online shopping company) has offered Rs 11.5 lakh per annum, while public sector Bharat Petro Chemicals has hired a few students by offering at an annual remuneration of Rs 10 lakh. Besides, among others, Texas Technology, Trigent, Altair, Samsung and Avtech are hiring students in the pay range of R 8 lakh to Rs 10 lakh a year.  ""The placement scenario looks very good this time. Since at least two more months are left for campus recruitment, we hope all students will have handsome offers with them,"" said TVS Sekhar, professor in-charge of career development cell at the IIT here.  Sources said after a slow start in September, the hiring picked up towards the end of October and in November. Tricon Infotech, Larsen and Toubro, Orient Cements and HCL are in the queue to come to the campus soon. Over 30 students have already got lucrative job offers from among around 90 students who will pass out in 2013. Though the first batch of the IIT (who passed out in 2012) too had 100% placement, the pay being offered this time is far higher with an average jump of 40 to 50%. The first batch had to contend with an annual offer of Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.  Sekhar said the institute is keen on core sector companies compared to the software sector so that the core competence of students is best used. ""This will help in career growth of students in the long term and optimum use of the students' talents by employers,"" he said. Sekhar said finally many students may not join jobs and opt for higher studies instead.

LT,2012-11-29T00:37:00+05:30,Josy Joseph,MoD probing Mazagon Dock’s JVs for warships,India News: The defence ministry has initiated a vigilance inquiry into Mumbai-based Mazagon Dock Ltd’s (MDL) move to set up joint ventures with private sector pl," NEW DELHI: The defence ministry has initiated a vigilance inquiry into Mumbai-based Mazagon Dock Ltd’s (MDL) move to set up joint ventures with private sector players in the face of allegations that these might be in violation of government guidelines.  The MDL management is close to signing its first JV with Pipavav Shipyard (now Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Company Limited) for warship construction. MDL is proposing similar joint ventures with Larsen & Toubro and ABG Shipyard.  Defence ministry sources said the vigilance department had sought a detailed report on all three proposed JVs, especially whether due diligence was carried out according to MoD guidelines which state that all options must be explored before such a venture is considered. They must  “process JV cases only where they appear to be the best possible option as compared to other forms of partnerships”.  The vigilance inquiry has sought information about the methodology adopted to arrive at the work allocation to the JVs and about the external consultants engaged for the projects.  The defence ministry’s move is the latest twist in the controversial effort of MDL to set up JVs in partnership with private shipyards with over Rs 100,000 crore worth of warship construction in the pipeline over the next several years.  When the move to establish a JV with Pipavav became public in September 2011, it led to instant uproar and protests by other private shipyards, forcing the defence ministry to put the move on hold. In February 2012, the ministry issued detailed guidelines on setting up JVs between defence public sector units and private sector companies.  According to complaints filed with the defence ministry, the latest move by MDL management may be in violation of these guidelines. The ministry had suggested outsourcing, subcontracting, formation of consortia and project specific SPVs (special purpose vehicle) among the options.  The ministry’s caution against JVs was because “defence PSUs must bear in mind that unlike other formations, SPVs and JVs will have their own legal existence that is separate from the legal existence of the partners, will require to be at an arm’s length from the DPSU, and also require specific long-term commitments from the partners”.  Defence ministry sources told TOI that the Mumbai-based defence PSU has carried out no such assessment. Instead of a detailed study for the best option, MDL just reaffirmed its old decision even after the guidelines came into being.  Confusion over what exactly the JV would do led to a tense meeting a few days ago in Mumbai between the MDL board and Pipavav leadership, including its chairman Nikhil Gandhi and several retired Navy admirals working for the private firm.  Sources said the Pipavav team was unhappy about MDL’s refusal to accept an IDBI report recommending that the proposed JV be given construction of four ships. The defence ministry’s vigilance wing is now looking into this IDBI report, and allegations that IDBI may have been far too favourable towards the JV.

Chinese firms have formally approached Indian authorities this month, particularly after Beijing announced its new leadership, government officials said.  But Indian suppliers, including state-run Bhel, are resisting Beijing's moves, worried that they may face unfair competition from China, which restricts access to its own market and helps its suppliers.  Funding by Chinese banks helped Reliance Power place a $10-billion order, the world's largest, with Shanghai Electric two years ago.  The issue came to the fore at a meeting between Indian and Chinese executives and officials coordinated by the Planning Commission on Monday.  Planning Commission official said Chinese companies are worried about the global slowdown in the sector. ""China has added about 6,00,000 mw power generation capacity in the last 10 years. Chinese power equipment makers have built huge capacities and the slowdown in the US and European markets is hitting them,"" he said.  At the meeting, the Indian side argued that the Chinese have an advantage as they started manufacturing equipment at least two decades ahead of Indian companies.  ""We insisted on collaborations in technology, research and turnkey contracts and said they should ease duty on imported power equipment in their own country before seeking relaxations here,"" a senior Ansaldo Caldaie India official said.  ""Their currency is artificially pegged and the manufacturers are offered subsidies that make their goods cheaper,"" he said.  India's power sector, which added 20,000 mw of capacity last year, is a lucrative market for foreign firms.  Supplies from Chinese firms such as Dong Fang and Harbin Electric International Co would also reduce costs for power producers, which are facing high costs, fuel scarcity and distribution bottlenecks.  India imposed a 21% duty on imported power equipment after strong demand from local suppliers. Government officials said Chinese firms want to set up facilities in India, but they want the import regime eased.  They are also concerned about various obstacles, including restrictions on Chinese participation in tenders.  ThermaxIndia Managing Director MS Unnikrishnan said setting up shop in India was a logical next step for Chinese firms.  ""No one can ignore India now. India will be the most competitive market with advantage of access to local market and probable export base.""  Chinese firms want a more liberal visa regime. India allows only highly-skilled Chinese technicians at power plants that have to justify the requirement at site. Officials said the home and labour ministries are not liberal in allowing Chinese executives to work in India.  State-run companies like NTPC and electricity boards are seeking only locally made equipment for their power plants, putting another obstacle for Chinese companies. But Indian firms such as Bhel, Larsen & Toubro and Ansaldo Caldaie India said China needs to open up its own power equipment market.  Industry officials said Chinese power equipment makers, including Shanghai Electric Corp and TBEA Shenyang Transformer Group, are strongly pitching for relaxation of import duty.  ""They argued that this would benefit common people as they can offer cheaper equipment and finance.  The companies also offered setting up manufacturing base and operation and maintenance facilities for servicing Indian power plants, but wanted the government to ease the norms first,"" said an industry official who attended the meeting.

""I have a family to support. I am the sole breadwinner as my father is critically ill. I could not afford to lose an opportunity of coming to this job fair where many companies are coming under one roof for recruitment,'' said Ambrish filling the company registration form at the Government Industrial Training Institute (ITI), Aliganj.  There were thousands like Kumar who came from their native places to Lucknow to attend the one-day job fair organised jointly by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Uttar Pradesh government. Since this was the first initiative taken to provide employment to ITI pass and final year students, there were more than 7,000 job seekers who poured in from Lucknow and other districts of the state. To register themselves, students queued up on the campus since as early as 8 am on Tuesday.  More than seven companies, including big names like Tata Motors, Hero Moto Corp, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), PTC Industries, Goldie Masale, Yash Papers and Mahakaleshwar Smile Parks Enterprises (MSPE) Pvt Ltd took part in the fair to hire students, mostly for technical jobs.  The crowd at the fair showed the desperation among the youth to be employed. ""It's a good initiative and gives a chance to apply in many companies increasing the possibility of getting a job,'' said Akshay Kumar, an ITI pass out. Students present however lamented that the jobs being offered were not permanent. ""Companies are hiring for only three to six months and for the next six months we are jobless again. This way most companies ask students to complete three stints and if they have to make recruit permanently, they select only from those trained by them,'' explained Shivang Singh, another ITI student. Many students who were already employed but about to complete their time frame also participated in the fair.  According to the employers, the job fair for ITI students will help establish an effective link between the industry and skilled talent pool. Manager, MSPE Pvt Ltd, Preeti Sharma said, ""There is abundant manpower in UP. We only need to train people so that they work efficiently.'' The company had come to recruit nearly 500 students for five various units to be made operational in UP.  Contented to see high participation of youth, regional employment officer P K Pundir said, ""It is the first time a job fair of such magnitude is organised for ITI students. The advantage of this fair is that a student gets an opportunity to put forth his resume in various companies. Earlier, we have been calling individual companies to hire people.'' The organisers said the job fair was aimed at filling the supply-demand gap of manpower in manufacturing and other industrial sectors.  Throwing light on the potential of students in UP, principal secretary, vocational education, GoUP Rajeev Kapoor said, ""Every year, the state produces around 50,000 ITI students. There is a good chance of generating employment for them only if we hone their skills.''  On the occasion, UP government cabinet minister for Labour and Employment Waqar Ahmad Shah said, ""There are many events lined up for unemployed youth. The job fair is one of them.'' Minister of state for labour and employment Shahid Manzoor said the success of such events could be best judged by the output they generate.  While career fairs keep happening for engineering and B-School students, such an activity for ITIs is unique. What impressed students was the fact that the recruiters had no fixed targets of the number of candidates to pick up. The recruiters hired students at different levels like apprenticeship, job trainees and permanent employees. After registration, students were asked to enrol themselves in companies they were interested in according to their eligibility. While many companies held on the spot interviews and written tests, others took the resume from the students to shortlist and contact at the time of selection.

With key benchmark shares weakening ahead of Diwali, analysts expect few surprises for the market this week.  ""This will be a week with low volumes and no specific direction in the market,"" said AK Prabhakar, SVP - research at Anand Rathi Financial. ""Indian traders don't tend to sell before Diwali; they either buy or hold on to their positions.""  In the last week, a lot of weakness was seen in index heavyweight stocks such as Reliance Industries Larsen & Toubro, Coal India and Hindustan Unilever. The Sensex fell 0.3% to 18,683.68, while the Nifty closed at 5,686.25, 0.2% down in the past week.  The index of industrial production for September and retail inflation for October will be announced on Monday. While industrial production could rebound from the 1.8% y-o-y contraction reported in August, high double-digit inflation could keep sentiment subdued. Wholesale price inflation for October, which is being watched for its response to the September diesel price increase, will be announced on Wednesday.  Markets will be open for a little over an hour on Tuesday for Muhurat trading, and will remain shut on Wednesday. Some large companies presenting September quarter earnings on Monday include JP Associates, GMR Infrastructure and DLF.  Several global developments will also be keenly watched by traders. The Greek parliament, which passed the first of austerity measures to help the ailing debt-ridden economy, is scheduled to pass the other part of the legislation this week, a development that could help elevate Euro area sentiment.  ""However, the next tranche may not be paid in full right away, and complicated negotiations regarding debt sustainability concerns still lie ahead,"" said Barclays analysts in a note.  ""While there is little debate that Greece will ultimately need some debt relief from its official euro area creditors, the timing and modalities remain contentious among the euro area member state governments, ECB and IMF,"" Barclays said.  Technical analysts said that they expect poor trading volume this week to keep movements in benchmark indices muted.  ""The charts are suggesting a sideways movement in the Nifty for next week, with the index is expected to trade in the 5,650-5,760 range,"" said Shard Konkani, senior technical analyst at Angel Broking.  ""There will be low participation next week and there are also two holidays, so one shouldn't expect any great volatility in the markets. Among sectors, metals are expected to do well as the US Dollar index is expected to fall. Tindal Steel and Hidalgo would be specific stocks to watch out for,"" he said.

The finance ministry had worked overtime to prepare the fiscal consolidation road map ahead of Tuesday's RBI policy review in the hope that the central bank would ""take coordinated action"".  Several officials that TOI spoke to said the finance ministry had been working to ready the plan for at least a fortnight. But the pace picked on Friday, the day RBI governor D Subbarao and Chidambaram held the customary pre-policy meeting. Senior officials said they were suddenly asked to speed up the fiscal consolidation plan. Although, three to four options on the fiscal deficit targets had been discussed, the finance minister himself drafted a final note which he discussed with the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the weekend. Late on Sunday, reporters were informed about a news conference to be addressed by Chidambaram but no details were given.  ""We were all ready for a rate cut after all the plan was approved at the highest level,"" said a senior official, who did not wish to be identified. The government had calculated that it had sealed a rate cut by addressing the RBI's key concern over the fiscal consolidation roadmap. ""RBI should have lent a helping hand. It could have sent a signal by cutting rates by 25 basis points,"" said a source involved with the fiscal consolidation plan. But RBI still has doubts about the government's ability to stick to the roadmap and rein in the deficit - a skepticism that several officers in the finance ministry share. Sources said while discussions on the Kelkar panel report were underway there were at least three projections on the tax receipts. Surprisingly, all of them suggested a sharp shortfall with the revenue department's own estimates being the most pessimistic. But Chidambaram was optimistic and ruled out the possibility of any shortfall, sources said.  ""It was probably a message to the direct and indirect tax departments that meeting the target was non-negotiable,"" said an official. Similarly, it was the finance minister who suggested that the revenue from spectrum auction would be in line with the budget estimates of Rs 40,000 crore. He also exuded the same level confidence on meeting the disinvestment target of Rs 30,000 crore, although it came with a caveat that the goal be achieved only if the government sold its remaining stake in companies such as Balco and Hindustan Zinc. But, officials in the finance ministry were surprised that despite the pressure on finances the government has chosen to ignore the Kelkar committee's recommendation that the Specified Undertaking of UTI (SUUTI) exit companies such as ITC, Larsen & Toubro and Axis Bank, a move which could translate into immediate gains of over Rs 50,000 crore. While the government seems to have accepted the Kelkar panel's proposal to monetize surplus land, it is not yet clear how it would pan out as there are several issues related to sale of these assets. ""Only the Andhra government has been able to sell a chunk of land otherwise it has been a very difficult experience,"" said an official.  With just five months left in the current fiscal year, the government is fighting an uphill battle not just to tame the fiscal deficit but also to convince RBI that its fiscal plan is credible.

It has now become clear that Unity Infrastructure is the only firm in the race.  At a meeting on the issue on Thursday, only Unity showed up, while other bidders Larsen & Toubro and Shapoorji Pallonji appeared to have pulled out of the race. Sources said negotiations were now on with Unity.  The lowest bidder, Unity Infraprojects, has quoted Rs 163 crore, a staggering 48% above the project cost estimate.  Other bidders Shapoorji Pallonji (Rs 167 crore) and Larsen and Toubro (Rs 177 crore) quoted bids that were 52% and 61% high respectively.  It was found that the rates quoted for civil works were way above the estimates. Especially, the cement concrete works were found to be much higher than the estimates. Similarly, bids for the IBMS and fire-fighting equipment were much higher.  Following the high bids, a high-powered committee, headed by chief secretary Jayant Kumar Banthia, on Tuesday ordered a detailed scrutiny of all the bids received for the Mantralaya revamp project.

The 12,000-sq m plot currently houses a bungalow, two guest houses, a research and development facility and an electric sub-station.  An erstwhile Swiss pharmaceutical company, Nycomed, was acquired by Takeda, a Japan pharmaceutical research company in 2011. Sources close to Mahindra confirmed the deal saying a formal agreement would be signed after land and legal documents are finalized in the coming weeks. The corporate itself remained non-commital. In an email reponse, a Mahindra spokesperson said, ""We keep looking at various opportunities that come up in our target markets.""  Real estate experts say the deal works out at approximately Rs 6,000 a sq foot. The plot has a development potential of 5 lakh sq ft under the new building planning rules framed by the civic body. Mahindra is planning to set up a high-end residential complex on the plot.  Developers like Kanakia and Sheth are selling under-construction flats at Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000 a sq ft against the quoted rate of Rs 10,000 a sq ft. Mahindra won the bid by beating other five bidders, including Larsen and Toubro Realty, who quoted between Rs 170 crore and Rs 203 crore, sources said. ""Though property prices are on the wane, there is still an appetite for clear land parcels from cash-rich corporates/developers. Further, the plot's proximity to Powai, an upscale residential locality, and the fact, majority of the corporates have relocated their offices to suburbs like Andheri makes it an attractive deal,'' said a real estate expert.  Deals in 2012  Runwal Group purchased a 14-acre Neosym Industry Ltd, a metal manufacturing company located on LBS Marg in Bhandup and owned by Kolkata industrialist C K Birla's family for over Rs 400 crore.  Sunteck Realty bought a 15-acre industrial plot at Goregaon for Rs 300 crore.  Lodha Group purchased 17-acres of DLF's Mumbai Textile Mill for Rs 2,700 crore.  Ajay Piramal-led Piramal Realty to jointly develop the 1.5 acre Famous Studio property with its owner, the Roongta family for around Rs 350 crore.

LT,2012-10-26T07:25:00+05:30,Samidha Sharma,More professionals in million-$ pay club,India Business News: The membership of the million dollar salary club in India went up only marginally this year even as more professional CEOs marked their presence on th," MUMBAI: The membership of the million dollar salary club in India went up only marginally this year even as more professional CEOs marked their presence on the elite group. For the financial year 2011-12, a total of 101 Indian CEOs took home a cool million dollars (Rs 4.5 crore) against 99 last year, signaling a moderation in remuneration being doled out to senior executives across India Inc. There may be a moderation in the growth of absolute numbers in the million dollar club but what is interesting to note is the fact that 75% of these executives saw a hike in their compensation and the collective salaries of the top ten head honchos rose by an average of 7.2% from last year. This indicates that despite the fact that not many new names entered the club, existing members saw their salaries go up despite a sluggish economy which has dampened the overall sentiment across corporate India over the last year or so.  Significantly, the share of professional CEOs in the million-dollar club went up once again, reflecting the changing power structures across India Inc. With more companies hiring professionals for the top job, the promoter to professional ratio now stands at 3:2, reveals a TOI-commissioned study conducted by global executive search firm EMA Partners. The study in order to make a fair comparison with last year, takes into account Rs 4.5 crore as the benchmark to calculate a million dollars despite the depreciating rupee. The depreciating rupee dealt a tough blow to a lot of sectors and if the current exchange rate was used as a reference point then only about 75 CEOs would have made it to the million-dollar CEO club. The EMA Partners' study, which takes into account only publicly listed firms, revealed that manufacturing was still the leader of the pack, despite a slight fall in share, when it came to the sectoral representation in the million dollar club.  In a growing trend over the last few years, professional CEOs demonstrated their prominence as now they collectively hold 40% share in the million-dollar club, another percentage point jump from last year. Promoter CEOs still rule the roost with as much as 60% share going to them, the study revealed. ""Even if you look at large promoter-run groups, professionals have started featuring in the million dollar salary list which speaks volumes of the changes happening across corporate India,"" says K Sudarshan, managing partner, India, EMA Partners International.  The sector-wise distribution has changed partially with new entrants from energy, automotive, shipping and cement sectors. There has been a decline of 8 percentage points in the industrial/manufacturing sector, from 48% last year to 40% this year. Torrent Power and Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries led with four executives each making it to the list of Rs 4.5 crore and above compensation. Whereas organizations like Hero Motocorp, J K Lakshmi Cement, Dr Reddy's, Shree Cement and Divi's Lab have three representatives each in the list.  For diversified conglomerate Larsen & Toubro, the individual pay package of its executives could not be ascertained, as the company has only disclosed total commission of Rs 53.45 crore of all executive directors in its annual report. Interestingly, L&T had seven executive in the million-dollar club last year. ""If promoters charge a premium through a transparent governance structure it is justified as they bear the most risk. However, professionals do bring in a high degree of sustainability to any organization; therefore, companies that can have a blend of both will benefit the most. Indian companies will see that over the next few years as growth happens more and more promoters will have to shed their stakes and that's when more professionals will come to the fore,"" says K Ramkumar, head HR, and an executive director on the board of ICICI Bank, the country's largest private sector lender.  Interestingly, an advisory firm has approached institutional shareholders of Jindal Steel & Power (JSPL) to restrain Naveen Jindal from having the powers to decide his own salary. Jindal of JSPL has been the top-paid executive for the last two years with an annual income of Rs 74 crore. ""Executives drawing million-dollar salaries, in particular the professionals, quite likely represent the cream of the leadership talent in India Inc. Their talent may be even more valuable during bad times than good times. So, it's not surprising that their talents are being well valued, especially in bad times,"" puts in ISB's assistant professor of finance, Krishnamurthy Subramanian.  GSK's Praveen Kumar Gupta saw his annual compensation grow by 330% this year. On the other hand, FMCG major Dabur's executives, Sunil Duggal and PD Narang, took a 50% cut in their respective salaries as compared to last year. Reliance Group's chairman Anil Ambani took a major cut and abstained from salary and commissions this year - he took a sitting fee of about Rs 5.4 lakh. Rick Bott of Cairn Energy, V S Iyer of Strides Arcolab, Godrej group's Adi Godrej, Manoj Chhabra from Prism Cement and the Singhanias of JK Cements got more than 100% increase in their salaries while Vivek Jain of Gujarat Fluoro took the highest cut.  ""These are volatile times for any company and so you need to infuse a sense of stability in your operations. Companies in India are looking to get the right person for the top job and if that comes in the form of a professional CEO who has diverse experience they are not hesitating anymore,"" says Nishchae Suri, MD of global HR consulting firm Mercer India.  Since salaries is a contentious issue in Indian Inc, most CEOs declined to comment. On the issue of high salaries, Atul Punj, chairman, Punj Loyd Group, said: ""Our compensation committee has a clear-cut strategy of tightly linking total rewards for the CEOs with business achievement."" Most experts agree that's the way to structure compensations.   ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/more-professionals-in-million-pay-club/articleshow/16961256.cms

TOI has learned that the state government’s chief architect was barred from attending the high-level meetings to discuss the project. This has raised eyebrows because the government outsourced the work to a private architect, Raja Aederi, to fix the cost estimate and invite builders.  The Mantralaya renovation work is the latest in the slew of controversial mega contracts awarded by the state public works department (PWD).  Sources in the construction industry said it was “shocking’’ that the lowest bid was Rs 163 crore against the official estimate of Rs 110 crore. “For restoring and renovating an area of around 1.25 lakh sq ft, the lowest quotation works out to an astounding Rs 13,000 a sq ft. Any builder or architect will tell you that a decent quality of similar work could be done at half the price,’’ said sources.  Over a month after a blaze gutted three floors of the state secretariat on June 21, chief architect of the PWD Bipin Sankhe was informed that he would not be required to attend the discussions on renovation work with state chief secretary Jayant Kumar Banthia. On August 23, Sankhe was told by PWD secretary Shymal Mukherjee to stay away from the meeting.  Sankhe then shot off a letter to Mukherjee, protesting that while junior officers were allowed to attend the meetings, he was being kept out. The letter, a copy of which was made available to this newspaper, said, “The chief architect is never called for meeting conveyed by you. On August 23, the chief secretary asked me to wait in his office because he wanted to discuss the Mantralaya renovation proposal. However, you told the chief secretary that my presence would not be required in the meeting.’’  Sankhe’s letter further said, “I am senior to all PWD engineers. As the state chief architect, I am responsible for any issue pertaining to architecture work. Yet, you have asked me to stay away from these meetings. I do not understand this logic.’’ Sankhe added, “You are supposed to function according to administrative rules and regulations. I should have been invited for these meetings. In the future, my department should not be held responsible for any architectural shortcomings.’’  When contacted, Mukherjee said, “The government has already nominated an independent architect and he has been giving his ideas. However, there should be no problem accommodating him (Sankhe) in the discussions. We have no issues with him. The priority is to get the work done properly. Besides, he is not a member of the high-level committee headed by the chief secretary.’’  The lowest bidder, Unity Infraprojects, said it quoted 48% above the project cost estimate, because the entire work has to be completed in less than a year. However, industry sources debunked this claim and said the short time-table need not lead to such a cost escalation. Other bidders were Shapoorji Pallonji (Rs 167 crore) and Larsen and Toubro (Rs 177 crore). The committee headed by the chief secretary is reviewing the project in wake of the unusually high bids.  The Mantralaya project involves restoration and renovation of the 4th, 5th and 6th floors on the main building. It includes structural strengthening, civil works, interiors, electrical fittings, plumbing and air-cooling system.  JJ’s space augmentation plan shelved  In 1999, the Sir JJ College of Architecture had submitted a Mantralaya modernization and space planning proposal to the state government at a cost of less than Rs 50 crore. The proposal would have created an additional 1.20 lakh sq ft of space in the state headquarters by installing modular furniture and civil work construction. “In the original design, the Mantralaya courtyard was supposed to be a usable space with water fountains and gardens. However, this was discontinued over the years. It is now proposed to rejuvenate this area with a water fountain, glass capsule lifts and a statue of Shivaji Maharaj in a proper setting. This courtyard space shall be a centre of attraction and similar to an atrium of a five star hotel,’’ said the proposal. However, the plan was put in cold storage by the state government.  Times view: Handle important projects with transparency  The Mantralaya makeover will be under intense scrutiny, given the number of scams that have been uncovered in several major projects undertaken by the government. So, it is imperative that the project is handled with total transparency. But the way things have taken off suggests that lessons have not been learnt and the same mistakes, which have led to scams in the past, could be repeated. The Mantralaya is the seat of governance in Maharashtra and its makeover needs to be handled more professionally; even a whiff of a scandal in this project can lead to serious political repercussions.

ONGC chairman Sudhir Vasudeva dedicated the platform to the nation on Sunday. The platform, built by Larsen & Toubro, had to be ordered after the old facility was completely destroyed in a fire that also killed 22 people in July 2007.  “It is a red letter day for ONGC since the new platform will help ramp up production exponentially. But it also is a sombre moment for us. Every life is precious. But many lives were saved on that fateful day. Many of those who died were still in the control room, confident that they would be able to stop the fields and could not leave,” Vasudeva said.  The fire was caused when a Shipping Corporation supply vessel’s engine died in cyclonic weather and it hit the gas-pumping pipeline of the old platform. All but 22 personnel who were on the platform were rescued. The government put the blame on then chairman Subir Raha and called it a national threat for denying him extension till his retirement.  The new complex will result in production of 55 million tonnes of oil and 6.5 billion cubic meters of gas by the year 2030. It will also augment ONGC's objective of enhancing the hydrocarbon recovery factor from the current 24% to 40%, Vasudeva said.  Of the current 196,000 bpd output from Mumbai High, 79,500 bpd comes from the northern part of the field that spans an area 25-km wide and 75-km long in the Arabian Sea. The rest comes from the southern part called Mumbai High South.  Vasudeva said the new platform, weighing 13,500 tonnes, was the largest on the Mumbai High field.

While the government had estimated a cost of Rs 110 crore for the entire project, the revamp may run up a bill of Rs 200 crore or more if it goes ahead with the bids received.  On Friday, the PWD opened bids called for the biggest component of the work. Sources said the lowest bidder, Unity Infrastructure, quoted over Rs 163 crore for the work, 48% above the estimated cost for the entire project. The other two contractors in the fray—Shapoorji Pallonji Group (Rs 167 crore) and Larsen & Toubro (Rs 177 crore)—quoted bids that were 52% and 61% higher, respectively.  The bids would now be placed before a high-powered committee headed by chief secretary Jayant Kumar Banthia. The panel would look into the reasons for the higher bids, he said.  While rules allow the state to negotiate with the lowest bidder, sources said such negotiations usually resulted in a decrease of not more than 5% of the original quoted bid. The sources said this would mean that the component’s cost would be above Rs 150 crore.  The Mantralaya building suffered heavy damage in the June 21 fire. The component for which bids were opened involves civil work, creation of additional office space and redirection of internal floor movement, the central AC, setting up meeting rooms or common areas for visitors on each floor and incorporating modern-day fire safety equipment, among other works.  Separate tenders have been floated for escalators and upgrade of lifts, setting up of chillers for theAC unit on the terrace and purchase of loose furniture. While the bids for these were yet to be opened, a source said the actual cost of these works could exceed Rs 25 crore.

The demand was for the development of an integrated complex at the Seawoods-Dharave railway station at Navi Mumbai. L&T won the project with its bid of Rs 1,809 crore and signed an agreement with Cidco in 2008. The controversy arose over the nature of instrument executed by Cidco in favour of L&T.  While L&T said it had signed a “development agreement” with Cidco and paid a stamp duty of Rs 18 crore in 2008, the latter termed the agreement as a lease. In 2011, the stamp duty department made a demand for additional Rs 64 crore as stamp duty.  The department contended that since L&T has paid lease premium of Rs 724 crore to Cidco, 60% of the total amount of Rs 1,809 crore, and has got possession of land to create third party rights in the future, the company will have to pay higher stamp duty.  In his order on the petition filed by L&T challenging the higher levy, Justice S C Dharmadhikari said, “By paying the lease premium to the extent of 60% and handing over possession, no rights are created, much less of a lease. The two parties have executed a development agreement with the limited purpose of construction and development of land. They have executed this agreement with creation of lease in future and until that lease is created and further a document executed in that behalf, L&T have been given a conditional right to sell the commercial portion.” ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/court-raps-stamp-duty-department-over-extra-levy/articleshow/16663971.cms
LT,2012-10-03T09:39:00+05:30,Shaji Vikaraman,Buoyant market spurs govt to sell UTI stakes in private companies,"India Business News: The government has started talks to sell its shares in Axis Bank, ITCBSE -0.71 % and Larsen & Toubro, an opportunistic move aided by the more than 9 p"," MUMBAI: The government has started talks to sell its shares in Axis Bank, ITCBSE and Larsen & Toubro, an opportunistic move aided by the more than 9 per cent increase in stock indices during the past two months.  The buoyant stock market, aided by a burst of policy decisions including allowing foreign investment in multi-brand retail, has expanded the government's options to raise funds and narrow the fiscal deficit closer to its target of 5.1 per cent, three people with knowledge of the matter said.  Based on Monday's closing prices, the government's holding in the three companies is worth Rs 44,000 crore, or Rs 14,000 crore more than its disinvestment target for 2012-13 from share sales in public sector companies.  ""Talks have started on this, but no decision on the modalities of the sale or timing has been taken,"" said an official associated with the discussions.  Ratings agencies have cautioned India about the possibility of a sovereign downgrade if the fiscal situation is not brought under control, and Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said the deficit will not be overshot by a wide margin. Assuming all government shares in the three private companies are sold before April 2013 at current rates, it could help lop half-a-percentage point off the fiscal deficit.  Last month, the government approved disinvestment in Hindustan Copper, Oil India, MMTCBSE -0.47 % and Nalco. In the last fiscal year, the government barely raised one-third of its Rs 40,000-crore target.  The government's shares - the 23.6 per cent holding in Axis Bank, 11.54 per cent in ITC and 8.3 per cent in L&T - are controlled by a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which inherited them from an arm of India's first mutual fund, the erstwhile UTI.  Selling shares in just ITC, a part of the benchmark Nifty and Sensex indices, will yield nearly 25,000 crore at the current market price. The holding in L&T, another blue chip, is worth more than Rs 8,000 crore.  While this appears an attractive option, selling such huge stakes may not be easy unless done in tranches, although there is a lot of investor interest in these stocks.  Indian insurance firms led by the largest insurer, LIC, as well as foreign investors have indicated interest in buying into these companies.  If the government were to go ahead with the proposal, it would have to seek fresh approval from the Cabinet. That is because the decision taken by the government envisaged the new holding company taking loans from state-owned banks on the strength of the substantial holdings in these three blue chips, and also buying into stocks of government-owned companies during divestment.  The special purpose vehicle came to own the shares after the Cabinet approved the winding up of the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India, which was created in 2002 by bifurcating Unit Trust of India.

Both Chopra and Aghi will work together in a model that is not unlike the joint-CEO model that Wipro Technologies tried and abandoned. ""My performance is going to be judged not by how services alone does, but the combined financial results of the company,"" said Aghi. ""We are joined at the hip.""The joint-CEO model has had a mixed track record in the recent past with both IT services company Wipro and smartphone maker Research In Motion abandoning it. Enterprise software maker SAP, however, continues to have a joint-CEO model.Aghi said the fundamental difference between L&T Infotech's and other joint-CEO models was that theirs was more of a market facing role to drive customer relations and analyst relations.

L&T, India's largest engineering and construction company, has climbed nearly 18 per cent so far this month compared with a 6 per cent gain for the benchmark Sensex.  Four major brokerages - Credit Suisse, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs - have donwgraded the stock, citing a variety of factors, including high valuations, muted order inflow and Chinese competition. While Goldman Sachs removed L&T from its Asia-Pacific 'Buy' list last Friday by downgrading its ratings to 'Neutral', JP Morgan and Nomura lowered their ratings to 'Underweight' from 'Neutral' and from 'Buy' to 'Reduce', respectively. Absence of buying opportunities in the market combined with the belief that the economy may turn around following the burst of reforms from the government are helping the stock. Business challenges notwithstanding, some investors think that L&T is still the best pick in the stress-laden capital goods sector. L&T shares, which were trading at Rs 1,341 at the end of August, touched its year high of Rs 1,616 on Monday before ending down 0.44 per cent at Rs 1,577.  ""The negatives that were anticipated in L&T's main businesses have been factored in. The recent reforms announced by the government indicate that order execution may pick up and there may be some recovery in industrial capex, which will boost order inflow,"" said Gaurang Shah, assistant vice-president, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.  In an attempt to de-risk business from the slowdown in the local market, The $12.8-billion conglomerate has in the past two years expanded its presence in the Middle East for hydrocarbon, power transmission & distribution and infrastructure projects.  L&T's revenue Q1FY13 rose 26 per cent y-on-y to Rs 12,078 crore, driven by a pick-up in order execution and a robust order book. Recurring profit-after-tax stood at Rs 890 crore, up 19 per cent. Its order book was worth Rs 153,095 crore as of June-end. It has guided that its order inflow in FY13 will be 15-20 per cent higher than Rs 70,574 crore reported a year ago. But analysts believe the guidance may be optimistic, particularly after it missed annual guidance for FY12. At the beginning of FY12, L&T had forecast an order inflow guidance of 15-20 per cent, cut it to 5 per cent subsequently and finally ended the year with a 12 per cent decline.  Geojit's Shah cautions that gains will remain capped in short-to-medium term as valuation appears expensive, and long- term investors may look at entering the stock at Rs 1,300-1,350. ""L&T has been an investor-friendly company, which announced bonus and dividends. There is comfort about its diversified portfolio and geographical expansion,"" he said.  ""L&T is arguably India's best play on the infrastructure and corporate capex cycle. However, an unfavourable macro-environment and impediments on new orders driven by policy paralysis across sectors plague L&T's medium-term growth and margin outlook,"" he said.

The contractors usually finish the projects according to their own discretion, as they usually do not have any standard to conform to.  When A-Ward residents decided to monitor the asphalting of five roads in Colaba, a task undertaken by the BMC, they discovered that the civic body had not even specified the minimum and maximum standards for various parameters to which the road contractors must adhere. “We monitored the roads for a year and the work is shoddy. With the roads being repaired in such a way, they will not last for too long,” said Kunti Oza, civic activist and member of A Ward Residents’ Association. Oza, with residents Ashad Mehta, Imran Mesiwala and Amber Nazare monitored 3rd & 4th Pasta Lanes, Lala Nigam, Minoo Desai and Sohrab Bharucha roads.  To check if the contractors had conformed to the standards set for them, the residents obtained documents from the BMC. “It was a shock when we saw that the methodology documents, which have the details on how the road work should be conducted, submitted by the contractor to the BMC. There was no specification mentioned. The BMC left most of the work to the contractor’s discretion,” said Oza. This, when the Standing Technical Advisory Committee has prepared a detailed chapter on how to design a road and sent it to the BMC.  Agreeing with the residents, former civil engineer with Larsen and Toubro Gautam Shroff said after the repairs, the BMC did not bother to take any sample to test its strength. “A circular spot is left on the road if a sample is taken from there and the patch is redone,” he said, adding the Colaba roads had no such evidence. He pointed to the documents, which had no mention of the parameters to be followed and in it, words like “optimum” are used liberally. “There is no mention of minimum and maximum standard. For instance, the methodology says optimum bitumen contents shall be decided based on certain factors. But what is the minimum requirement of bitumen is not mentioned, compacted density as a percentage of loose thickness is not prescribed or the final thickness is not specified,” he said, adding all were left to the contractor’s discretion.  According to Oza, though BMC engineers visited the sites, the construction turned out to be poor. “It only shows that even civic engineers were clueless about what specifications to insist upon,” she said.  When TOI showed the document to STAC chairman N V Merani, he pointed out that the basic design of the road was also missing from. “The BMC has to specify each layer that forms the road and its thickness. Before that, it has to survey the road and identify the portions that are weak or depressed owing to poor drainage or poor quality of material. It is essential to tackle these before a reconstruction,” he said. Ideally, Merani said, the methodology document must be more elaborate than the tender document and it has to mention the minimum and maximum standards to be followed. The STAC has given the BMC the guidelines of preparing a methodology document, which includes the exact deployment of machinery and the output expected. “More often than not, no methodology document is prepared. Even if it is assumed that the contractor will follow the standards laid down by the Indian Road Congress, the BMC has to specify each of these and ensure regular laboratory tests are undertaken. The STAC has written a detailed chapter on how to design a road. Our recommendations are not being followed everywhere,” he said.  A senior civic engineer, however, claimed that the BMC had rectified the anomalies in all its 2012 tenders. “We have incorporated the STAC recommendations while preparing the papers,” he said.  Merani even exhorted residents to hire an expert so that the roads can be checked periodically and then show the reports to the civic body. “After all, it is the BMC that has supervised the work,” he said.  Times view: Take infrastructure issues more seriously  If this RTI answer is typical of what happens with road-laying and repairs, then it should come as no surprise that Mumbai’s roads are so bad. It appears that the BMC leaves everything to the contractor’s mercy. Residents deserve kudos for exposing the haphazard manner in which infrastructure issues are tackled in Mumbai.

Diversity of culture, nationality, skill sets and even thought is being looked at with a certain degree of seriousness while recruiting.  While some companies that used to focus on a particular category of educational institutions are now exploring newer avenues of recruitment, a few others are keen on making their culture globally diverse by hiring employees of different nationalities. There are still others who are recruiting entry-level managers by gauging their passion to pursue their dreams, a process aimed at promoting diversity of thought.  Recently, Godrej Group officials visited campuses with a new approach to hiring. They launched 'Godrej live out your dreams', or LOUD, to look for unique personal quests that students want to pursue. By giving them a chance to articulate their dream and also helping them live it out, Godrej hopes to rope in talent that thinks differently. The initiative is not related in any way to business plans, which most other companies look for during campus recruitment. In addition to the prize money, winners will get pre-placement summer offers at Godrej.  ""When you go to a campus and ask for extra-curricular activities, you get very typical responses like reading, singing, etc. The challenge was to pick a person who is really passionate about doing that extra bit which is out of the ordinary. This can be brought about through such initiatives alone,"" said Sumit Mitra, executive VP (corporate HR), Godrej Industries.  Even at the leadership level, the organization wants to bring about diversity of experience. The leadership profile at Godrej is said to be changing from what it was five years back when it was largely dominated by the engineer/IIT/IIM type of workforce.  At Deutsche Bank's captive centre servicing its business units, US and Chinese nationals have been hired for the first time. The agenda is to build a multi-cultural organization. The bank believes that cultural diversity can bring in a different stream of thinking, which will be useful in the future.  L'Oreal India is another company that has attracted people from other nationalities. ""We have seen a few cases where people from other nationalities, who may have come to India, have applied for a job at L'Oreal India. We have hired some of these (candidates of) other nationalities depending on what skill they bring to the table, especially in areas like retail merchandising where such skills are not easy to find in India. Because the retail landscape in India is not yet developed, we need to bring in such skills from outside,"" said Mohit James, director HR, L'Oreal India. People from four to five different nationalities currently work at L'Oreal India.  Larsen & Toubro's new MD & CEO K Venkataramanan also wants to induct people from other nationalities to build a strong multi-cultural leadership pipeline. ""While we already have hired a few senior officials of other nationalities, that (the process) would gain pace and we plan to get these people into the executive level and maybe to the board level some day,"" he told TOI recently.  Companies like Siemens, on the other hand, make it a point to recruit from NITs (National Institutes of Technology) of all states. This automatically maintains diversity in culture.  L'Oreal India is also looking at diversity of skill sets. From hiring IIM graduates to hair dressers, it's important for L'Oreal India to maintain diversity of skill sets - crucial to meet the company's varied business needs. ""Beauty needs in India differ from region to region.

LT,2012-08-21T04:53:00+05:30,Reeba Zachariah,Promoters put a price tag on family name,"India Business News: Shareholder activist Anil Singhvi is surprised that Nusli Wadia asked Britannia Industries, one of India's most admired food companies, to pay royalty"," MUMBAI: Shareholder activist Anil Singhvi is surprised that Nusli Wadia asked Britannia Industries, one of India's most admired food companies, to pay royalty for using the Wadia name. ""Britannia is a far more popular brand and it may indeed be a reminder to consumers that the Wadias own Britannia,"" said Singhvi, who co-founded Institutional Investors Advisory Services India.  The Wadias have only done what the Tatas and the Godrejs have implemented, what Larsen & Toubro plans to do or a move the Aditya Birla Group mulled in the past. India's most storied conglomerates want their publicly listed companies to pay for using their family names. Smaller business groups have also joined in with Chennai-based Shriram and Kerala-based Muthoot Finance among others seeking a similar fee.  What drives promoters to put a price tag on usage of their name? Brand experts argue it's an institutionalized way for promoters to cash-in on their name, and build a truly holding company model with stable revenue. But misplaced demands, where family name matters less in a changing business environment, could irk public shareholders, especially in a market cynical about corporate governance.  The Wadias disclosed the plan to charge group companies - Bombay Burmah Trading, Bombay Dyeing, Britannia Industries and GoAir - 0.35% of their profits for employing the family brand and benefiting from the shared services of the group. While the financial world knows that these companies are part of the Nusli Wadia empire, the public at large doesn't have such connect.  A top group official admitted that the Wadia brand has little relevance in the group's consumer-facing business like Britannia Industries but said the conglomerate now intends to leverage on the corporate brand. ""The Wadia name has come to represent quality, trust and good corporate governance standards. And companies will benefit and enjoy from the brand's goodwill like in the real estate business. Bombay Realty commands a premium in the market because of the strong brand equity of the Wadia name.""  Singhvi wondered whether Britannia's independent directors will have any justification for asking the company to pay such a royalty. Shriram Subramanian, MD of InGovern Research Services, said, ""The Wadias haven't put up the decision for voting by shareholders. When the promoter is hoping to benefit from the company at the cost of other shareholders, it should at the least be put up for vote as a special resolution requiring 75% approval.""  The Tatas - who unlike the Wadias have a stronger group identity - were the first to ask group companies to pay fees for using the pedigree name in the late '90s. The group's holding company, Tata Sons, manages and monitors the Tata brand with an estimated worth of $16 billion. Tata Brand Equity Promotion Scheme requires companies that directly use the Tata name to pay 0.25% of turnover or 5% of profit before tax, whichever is lower, whereas companies that don't use the Tata name directly, for instance, Voltas and Indian Hotels Company, have to pay 0.15% of their turnover.  The real estate business where brand name matters significantly saw Godrej Properties signing a brand usage agreement with the parent for the Godrej trademark a few years ago. Godrej Properties is the only company within the Godrej group that pays a royalty of 0.5% of its turnover. Interestingly, Muthoot Finance has an agreement with the promoters to pay a royalty of 1% of gross income, subject to promoters continuing to hold 50% of the company. ""Promoters believe their names have an intrinsic value. But there are some brands which can harvest it, and some which can't. We are likely to see situations where public shareholders can question such demands if not done transparently,"" said brand expert Harish Bijoor.

But officials are hoping to up the frequency to one train every two minutes 30 seconds once footfalls reach six lakh passengers a day.  “Initially, we will operate four-car trains every four minutes 30 seconds during peak hours along the Washermanpet-Chennai airport and Chennai Central-St Thomas Mount stretches,” said a senior metro official. Peak hour frequency will be raised once patronage picks up, hopefully in the next ten years.  By then, Chennai would catch up with Delhi Metro Rail in terms of frequency of services. CMRL will also try to match Delhi on carriage capacity.  Delhi metro carries an average 1,500 passengers in a four-car standard gauge train while Chennai is hoping to accommodate 1,276 commuters on a similar train. Bangalore Metro Rail currently transports nearly 1,000 passengers in a three-car train.  The first set of these locally made coaches for Chennai Metro will be ready by January 2014 at French multinational Alstom’s plant at Sri City in Andhra Pradesh, 55 kms from Chennai. The plant will be commissioned by September this year, said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, president of Alstom Transport. “We decided to build a plant because we wanted to be close to our client. Also, it would serve our other clients in Asia,” said Lafarge.  Alstom is slated to supply 168 stainless steel coaches to Chennai Metro, with which it had signed a Rs 1471.3 crore contract. The first set of coaches, that were made at the company’s plant in Brazil will reach Chennai by March 2013, said a CMRL official.  The stainless steel coaches for Chennai will be air-conditioned and have automatic sliding doors.  “The coaches are similar to Delhi Metro with a unique feature of platform screen door for underground stations which is not there in other metros,” said Jojo Alexander, managing director of Alstom Transport, India. It will also have special class coaches with cushioned seats and reserved class for women passengers. Space for wheelchairs, emergency passenger exits, passenger-driver communication system, closed circuit television, route maps in English and Tamil and reduced noise levels are some of the other features.  The consortium of Alstom and Larsen & Toubro has also started on the track work for CMRL. The first stage of track installation work will be completed in 2013 and will become operational in early 2014. “Alstom’s Coimbatore manufacturing Unit will be providing the traction elements for Chennai,” said Alexander.  The company will invest 30 million euros to develop the Sri City plant, which will eventually become the hub for their business in India and Asia. The Sri City plant, spread over 150 acres, is part of the transport giant’s expansion plan in the growing rail market in India and Asia.  “When we were awarded the CMRL contract, we knew our factory wouldn’t be ready with the first set of trains. That is why we are getting them from our Brazil plant that uses the same technology,” said Thibault Desteract, vice-president, commercial, Alstom Transport.

While expressing their deep concern, captains of Indian industry said disputes between trade and management must be settled through peaceful dialogue. Most CEOs, however, fear such incidents might dent the country's image of offering a business friendly environment.  A M Naik, chairman, Larsen & Toubro, said the incident would definitely dampen investors' confidence in that part of the state. ""Whatever be the relationship between the workers and the management, it should not have resulted in what happened with the general manager. Such an act is least desirable and I condemn it.""  Terming it as ""extreme, ruthless and very unfortunate"", Azim Premji, chairman, Wipro, said the incident is representative of the social unrest that is building up within the country and among trade unions. ""You have to understand that when growth slows down, job creation also slows down thereby creating unemployment. And unemployed people can generate social unrest. While the government should deal ruthlessly with the perpetrators of the violence, it is also important for the government, companies, industry organizations and others to come together and come to an understanding on how to deal with the environment,"" said Premji.  With many avenues available to resolve such sticky issues between management and trade, including labour courts, CEOs are unable to decipher the extent to which the Maruti management-worker dispute could go to. Ramesh Chauhan, chairman, Bisleri International, said there was no question of the management being unjust. In his view, what transpired at Manesar was far too stretched considering there are labour courts in the country where such disputes can be resolved.  Adi Godrej, chairman, Godrej Group, and president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said an incident of this nature was most unexpected especially since a dialogue was on between the management and the workers on unresolved issues. ""CII strongly believes that any disputes between the management and the workers must be settled through a discussion and a dialogue in a peaceful environment within the rubric of law,"" said Godrej.  While CII fears that the event would dent the country's image which might impact investors' impressions of India in terms of safety of investments, another industry body, FICCI said the violence is a matter of deep concern for a country that seeks to protect itself as offering an environment that is business friendly. ""The incident has sent shock waves in the corporate boardrooms of companies, both at home and abroad. The message from India needs to ring out loud and clear that the lives and property of its citizens is safe and any breach in the law and order and industrial relations situation will be dealt with firmly,"" said R V Kanoria, president, FICCI.  Raghupati Singhania, vice chairman & MD JK Tyre & Industries, echoed the sentiments. ""It's clearly an act of violence and vandalism. It is highly detrimental to the industrial climate and should be dealt with firmness and the guilty should be brought to book.""  However, not everyone is squaring the blame on the government. Some CEOs believe the onus of creating good relations with the trade lies with the management. The belief is that workers should also feel secure in terms of job security. ""The sentiment of the working laborers should also be given respect. One must create an environment so that the workers feel like family members. I have over 20,000 workers and they all are part of the family. There has to be a line of communication between the workers, union and the senior management so the scope of any rumors or misunderstanding does not arise between them,"" said V N Dhoot, chairman and managing director, Videocon Industries.

The port, ready since May, has been granted permission to be a trans-shipment facility, which means it can only unload goods in containers for trans-shipment and load goods trans-shipped in containers for export. The port would have to send containers to other ports for custom clearance, which would increase the cost and time of shipment. The greenfield port needs to set up a custom clearing office, which senior customs officials said is difficult currently given a severe shortage of manpower.

At 6 ft 5 inches, KV as he is called, towers over most other employees of the defence-to-IT conglomerate Lars","It's difficult to miss K Venkataramanan. At 6 ft 5 inches, KV as he is called, towers over most other employees of the defence-to-IT conglomerate Larsen & Toubro. It's another thing that he still continues to be called the opposite-Shorty or Tiny-the first a nomenclature from his college days and the other is how H Holck Larsen, the company co-founder, would call him.  His appointment as chief executive and managing director at the Rs 53,738-crore company this April capped years of debate over the critical issue of succession at L&T, where the company's larger than life 70-year-old boss A M Naik reigned for over a decade. KV's appointment also led to the bifurcation of the chairman and managing director's post with Naik retaining the chairman's position for another five years.   For the man who swears by the holy trinity of Siddhivinayak (he always carries one in his pocket), Tirupati and Shirdi, it was really by chance that KV landed up in L&T since it was Union Carbide that he really wanted to work with. He cracked L&T first through a campus interview and stayed on for a starting salary of Rs 550 against Rs 850 per month offered later by Union Carbide, where he had also applied.  ""That's a long story,"" he said. On hindsight, it's turned out to be a good decision. It's small wonder then that idols of Ganesh and Sai Baba adorn a corner of his office at the L&T works compound in suburban Mumbai's Powai.  A graduate in chemical engineering from IIT Delhi, which awarded him a distinguished alumnus award recently, KV has spent four decades in the company. He describes himself as someone who is multi-dimensional, approachable, a relationships person (he is still in touch with families of people who taught him) and prefers to delegate work.  An ardent sportsman during his younger years, he continues to play tennis and badminton. He recalls with pride his achievements on the field during his IIT days where he would be the champion in all the racket games-table tennis, badminton and lawn tennis. The achievements in the professional space have been equally visible. KV-known for his warm hugs-is credited with helping in the transformation of L&T from a fabrication-driven EPC contractor to a technology-led player and also steered its international operations.  He describes the pre-liberalization period between 1987 and 1990 as his golden period professionally when he successfully headed projects work at Hazira. Above all, KV prides himself as a project management specialist. That's a skill that would be tested during the difficult period that lies ahead. He predicts the next 12 to 18 months would be challenging. ""There is a strong need for second generation reforms around infrastructure, especially power. The government is well meaning but it needs to create a climate for more foreign direct investment,"" he says, adding that the India story remains strong.   That's perhaps because he himself is prepared. L&T has recently set up a war room to monitor the Rs 10,000-crore investments that it has made in the past two to three years. To tide over the uncertain period, it is keeping a close watch on cash management, cost cutting and productivity improvement. ""This is a period of making a big difference and I have to nurse our investments in new areas such as ship building, power equipments and the nuclear forge shop"". All these three investments were executed in the last two to three years and takes up now 50 % of his management time. L&T has also had to push back the company's five-year plan ""Lakhshya 2015"", which was to have ended in 2015, by another year.  It's not difficult to explain why. The order book is down from Rs 80,362 crore in 2010-11 to Rs 70,574 crore in 2011-12. The guidance for the year for both revenue and orders is a conservative 15-20 % against last year's 21 %.   KV, who regards Naik as his role model, doesn't believe that the three-year term that he has as CEO is small% to make a difference. So apart from monitoring the investments, his other priorities %include giving a greater thrust to internationalization of the company and build a strong multi-cultural leadership pipeline. ""While we already have hired a few senior officials of other nationalities, that would gain pace and we plan to get these people into the executive level and maybe to the board level also some day.""

In accordance with the announcement from TANGEDCO, Trichy, those who enrolled for getting new EB connections can buy the meters for single and three-phase connections from the four authorised dealers of two meter manufacturing companies Larsen & Toubro and Linkwell.

So it is clear that the problem will come to an end immediately.""  According to TNEB, consumers may buy meters from the authorised dealers from other districts like Chennai and Coimbatore.  However, consumers are not ready to spend on transportation in addition to the extra cost to be incurred on buying the meters outside Trichy.  M Sekaran, president of the federation of consumer and service organisations, raises an objection to the process that TANGEDCO should not restrict consumers from buying meters from particular dealers as it is against consumer rights guaranteed by the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.

A memorandum of understanding will be signed between IIT-M and the association on June 7 in this regard. Each participating company will bring a ‘mentor’ and a subject matter or domain expert. There will be joint development of curriculum, research projects, individual technology demonstrations, and training workshops under the MOU. The idea is to infuse contemporary technology and content into the educational system.  Industrial automation is the use of control systems such as computers to control industrial machinery and processes, replacing human operators. In the scope of industrialization, it is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the physical requirements of work, automation greatly reduces the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well.

Investors dumped stocks belonging to those sectors which are policy-driven rather than stocks belongs to any particular group,"" said Pankaj Pandey, head of research at ICICI Securities.  Power Grid, Mahindra Satyam, Idea Cellular, NHPC and JSW Steel were among the top companies in which retail holdings have seen a drop.  ""Investors cut their exposure from sectors particularly belongs to power, telecom and infrastructure as power companies are struggling for the past few months on coal issues and supply front while infrastructure companies are under pressure on the cut in government spending,"" said Dipen Shah, head of research at Kotak Securities.  Meanwhile, companies such as BHEL, Lanco Infratech and State Bank of India have added over a lakh retail shareholders each during 2011-12. Other top companies in which the number of retail share holders have gone up were Power Finance Corporation, GVK Power, KS Oil, Larsen & Toubro, Tata Motors and Tata Steel.

Broader sentiment will be driven mainly by April inflation numbers to be declared on Monday, which will give cues on future rate action by the Reserve Bank of India. Investors will also observe how Greek politics unfold in the week and if a new coalition government will adopt harsh austerity measures that are critical for the debt-laden nation to receive bailout funds from the eurozone.  Benchmark indices fell 3% last week as the government's insistence on a tax demand on British telecom major Vodafone stirred fears among investors over a similar tax treatment of foreign institutional investors (FIIs).  A contraction in the index of industrial production for April added to the gloom. BSE's Sensex fell 538 points in the week to close at 16,292.98 points, while Nifty slid 157 points to end the week at 4,928 points. Shares of banks, IT firms and metal sector companies led the fall.  The wholesale price index-based inflation for April, which will be announced on Monday, is expected to show a marginal decline.  Analysts' consensus expectations peg the year-on-year inflation rate for April at 6.6%, down from 6.9% reported in March, said a note by Barclays Capital.  ""Food inflation and weak rupee will keep pressure on headline inflation, but 'core' inflation will likely stay anchored around 5%,"" the note said. However, analysts said policy measures may not follow soon due to weakening in the macro economy.  ""Looking at the stress indicated by a number of economic variables, the fiscal and monetary authorities should announce some measures to improve the investment environment, such as aggressive monetary loosening,"" said Jignesh Shah, executive director at investment advisor Sarasin-Alpen India.""However, in the immediate term, such measures look unlikely,"" he said.  Quarterly results by industry leaders such as L&T on Monday, Bajaj Auto on Thursday and State Bank of India on Friday will be keenly watched. Investors are especially awaiting SBI's results to assess the impact of asset quality on earnings of state-run banks. Traders turned pessimistic after SBI's smaller peers reported a rise in non-performing loans, with the BSE Bank index declining 4% last week.  ""What we would like to see in SBI's results is where it is in the non-performing assets (NPA) cycle and the size of its restructured assets book. These indicators will be important in determining the course of public sector banking shares in the near term,"" said Aneesh Srivastava, CIO at IDBI Federal Life Insurance.  Analysts said, based on technical indicators, a rise of about 100-150 points in the Nifty from the current levels is not ruled out.  ""The current trading zone of 4900-4950 can act as a good support, and we are looking for a temporary pullback to 5150 levels,"" said Shubham Agarwal, senior technical analyst at Motilal Oswal Securities.  ""We will advise building short positions only if the Nifty breaches below 4900 points,"" he said.

Its operator has his eyes fixed on a machinery manager. For the next few hours, the manager guides the operator as he pulls huge steel girders out of the shaft to accommodate two tunnel-boring machines at the metro rail work site at Nehru Park on Poonamallee High Road.  The girders, weighing a few tonnes, are being removed from the shaft into which giant tunnel-boring machines, weighing approximately 400 tonnes, will be lowered two months from now.  Work to launch tunnelboring for the Chennai Central-Koyambedu stretch of the Chennai Central-St Thomas Mount corridor has picked up pace. ""We are removing the girders and columns that supported the walls of the shaft because the concrete is set and the walls are strong enough. A one-metre thick basement slab, which can bear the weight of the tunnel-boring machine, is being concreted. We have also marked the location from where the machines should start boring,"" said a metro rail official.  The type of construction chosen is determined by the type of soil and water level. The rocky soil underneath Poonamallee High Road has forced engineers of Larsen and Toubro (L&T), which has the contract to build underground stations and tunnels at Nehru park, KMC and Pachaiyappa's College, to adopt a ""bottom up"" method to build the shaft.  ""Building underground stations at Udyog Bhavan and Green Park in Delhi was a cakewalk as the soil was easy to cut open and dig. Here, it is rocky at a depth of 13-17 metres in some places and sandy in other places and the water table is also high,"" said an engineer.  As the works involve huge machinery, sophisticated machines are used to check vibrations on nearby buildings where tilt metres, crack metres and building settlement markers are placed. ""Our officials check these instruments regularly to find if there are any changes. An online monitoring system is also implemented by which impact on buildings is monitored at a control centre at the main site office of L&T,"" said an engineer.

But thanks to the flyover project that will be constructed between Keshtopur and Joramandir, more than 50 trees have been felled over the past couple of weeks to make way for the project.  Flyover project eats into the greenery on the VIP Road. More than 50 fully grown trees have been felled between Keshtopur and VIP Road Big Bazar in the past couple of weeks. The trees have been chopped to facilitate the construction of the two-kilometer flyover project between Keshtopur and Jora mandir.  The flyover project was mooted nearly five years ago after the most preferred route to the airport - the eight-kilometre VIP Road - was plagued with traffic congestion. The stretch between Kestopur and Joramandir was the worst affected. With traffic moving at a snail's pace, the flyover was supposed to alleviate the problems of commuters, especially those on their way to the airport. Five years later, the scene remains the same since work for the project is finally set to begin.  Work on the flyover project is set to begin finally after about five years since the project was mooted. The most preferred route to the airport, the eight kilometre VIP Road is plagued with traffic congestion. The stretch between Kestopur and Joramadir is the most problematic. During the peak hours traffic moves at snarl's pace making it difficult for commuter's, specially ones on way to the airport. The flyover was proposed to solve this problem.  However, the felling of trees to make way for the flyover, came as a rude shock to residents as well as commuters. They were taken aback to see each and every tree on the sideways being chopped off. The two-kilometre stretch now wears a barren look. Residents as well as commuters through the stretch were taken aback when they noticed every single tree on both sideways being hacked. Now the two kilometre stretch wears a barren look with all the trees gone.  ""Was it necessary to fell so many trees? Already a large number of trees has been poisoned to death in this corridor to the airport by those in the billboard and hoarding business. It is sad to see greenery being robbed this way,"" said Raja Bhowmick of Narayantala.  PWD engineers said that the pillars of the flyover will come up at the middle of the road. Was Therefore was the felling of trees along the sideways a rational move then? PWD officials defend it.  ""Besides the flyover, the two-kilometre stretch will also be widened by 20meters on each flank to make way for a cycle track and a service road. The trees were acting as an obstruction therefore they had to be cleared at the start of the project. Each tree was felled after complying with all formalities of the forest department,"" said an engineer with the PWD's Barasat Highway Division I.  The flyover will be constructed by Larsen & Toubro at a cost of Rs 216 crore of which 35% will be borne by the central government under JNNURM. The 14 metre broad flyover will have four lanes.  The forest department confirmed that the trees were felled after going through all formalities like signing a bond for the compensatory plantation. The forest department has, however, not identified the appropriate location for such plantation.  ""After getting an application from PWD, forest department officials inspected the stretch on VIP Road and found that felling the trees were really essential to make way for the flyover. PWD has submitted a non-refundable security deposit to plant five saplings against each tree felled. We will take up the plantation work within the next two years after identifying the right place,"" said Kaushik Sarkar, divisional forest officer, North 24-Parganas.

The Bali Mandir stands in the middle of the road now. The national highway authority of India (NHAI) has issued a number of notices to the trustees of the temple, but the issue is yet to be resolved. As a result, speeding vehicles on the highway coming towards the city from the Ozar side have to reduce their speed and hit their brakes after sighting the temple. All the vehicles on the highway have to change the lane for a few meters to bypass the temple.  Ever since work on the highway began, the location of the temple has been the focus of attention. The NHAI says it has issued a number of notices to the temple trust, but they are demanding money for relocating it. ""As it is the temple stands on government land. Now, the trustees are demanding money for relocating the temple elsewhere. According to reports, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), which has taken up the work of road widening of the stretch between Gonde and Pimpalgaon, has offered the trust a sum of Rs 15 lakh for setting up the temple at some other place. However, the trustees are demanding Rs 70 lakh for the same,"" said project director of the NHAI, Sriram Mishra.  During the night hours, there is a possibility of fatal accidents due to the presence of the temple in the middle of the road, NHAI officials said.  Meanwwhile, MP Pratapdada Sonawane, who is involved in the shifting of the temple elsewhere after the due rituals, said, ""The Bali Mandir is one of the oldest temples in Nashik and Nashikites have a lot of devotional attachment towards the temple. Even during the festival of Dussehra, a lot of people from Nashik visit this temple to pay obeisance. The temple is also said to have contributed towards the development of the city. So, it becomes our duty to ensure that the temple is carefully relocated to a new place. A few months back, the NMC commissioner had decided to give land for the temple. However, since the new commissioner has taken over now, we will once again have to initiate the talks.

Meanwhile, while the road widening work is fast underway and is expected to be completed by the end of this year, NHAI officials said if there is no breakthrough in the talks, they will ask the district administration to intervene and get the temple shifted.

The Narendra Modi government is set to change all that by nominating party man Kamlesh Joshipura, 51, on one of the two seats reserved for the state government on IIM-A’s board of governors.  Joshipura can claim to have insight into education policy as vice-chancellor of the Indian Institute of Teacher Education, but this again is a government appointment. The other appointment by the state government to IIM-A board is education secretary Hasmukh Adhia, a tradition that has not been broken. Out of the 15-member board, both state and Central governments can nominate two persons each.  Joshipura’s nomination gives Modi a foothold in one of the country’s best business schools. “It is an honour. I have also received a letter from IIM-A director Samir Barua inviting me to participate in the board’s meeting in June,” Joshipura told TOI.  The board is chaired by A M Naik, chairman and managing director of Larsen & Toubro, who is known to be close to Modi.  So far the state government nominated senior bureaucrats to the board. This year the institute’s memorandum of association was amended to reduce the number of board members from 25 to 15.  Joshipura has served two terms as the vice-chancellor of Saurashtra University. Before he took up this assignment, he was the president of BJP’s Rajkot city unit. BJP sources say it was in 2001 when Narendra Modi contested a by-election from Rajkot that the two had bonded and their bonhomie continues till date.  Asked why Joshipura was nominated, chief secretary A K Joti said, “It is not an individual decision but that of the Gujarat government. The name came from the state education department and it was finalized by the government.”  A commerce graduate, Joshipura also holds an LLM degree and a PhD on human rights. He used to work in the faculty of law in SU before being appointed as the VC of the university in 2005. In 2007, Joshipura was instrumental in gathering a huge number of college students for the CM’s youth initiative – Yuva Sangram in Rajkot. “I have not been in active politics. I am committed to fulfilling the responsibility given to me,” said Joshipura.

With the government amending the rules last week, highway developers taking up projects under the public-private partnership route can now get loans for the entire contract period of 20-25 years. So far, banks and financial institutions provided loans for up to 15 years. After that, they had to go for higher-cost loans since the debt had to be refinanced. So, developers borrowed at 12-13 % for the initial years and then ended up shelling out anywhere between 17.5% and 20.5% on the refinanced part of the debt. Besides, there are only a handful of agencies such as IDFC and IIFCL which offer refinance.  Developers faced this problem due to a government notification which required them to amortize the value of the project over 15 years. So, at the end of this period, the value, at least in the books, was treated as zero, making it difficult for banks to lend beyond this period. In a notification issued on April 17, the ministry of corporate affairs said the amortization amount or the rate should be such as that the cost of the toll road is amortized over the entire concession period, which could be up to 30 years. ""It's going to provide a lot of relief. Once developers tie up funding, they don't have to worry about refinancing and take up new projects,"" said M Murali , secretary general of National Highway Builders Federation.  PPP road projects are executed on build-operate-transfer (BOT-toll ) model where the developer recovers its investment and makes profit by collecting toll during the contract period. In another model known as BOT-Annuity , the developer manages fund and pays interest to lenders over the entire concession period. NHAI then repays the entire amount, with interest , to the developer in installments.

The average FII holding in these companies is about 20," NEW DELHI: Enamoured by the large blue-chip stocks of Indian market, the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have raised their exposure to five out of every six Sensex companies with purchase of shares worth an estimated USD five billion so far in 2012.  Even as the concerns are being raised about some changes in India's policy concerning overseas investors, the market data suggests a rather bullish stance adopted by the FIIs in their stock market dealings this year.  Most of the foreign entities sell or purchase Indian stocks through FII route and the data shows that only five out of 30 Sensex companies have witnessed a decline in their FII holding since January 2012 -- that too of a modest level.  On the other hand, the FII holding has increased in 24 Sensex companies during this period, while comparable data is not available for one entity, HDFC Bank.  Together, the FIIs are estimated to have purchased shares worth about Rs 27,000 crore (over USD five billion) in these 24 Sensex companies, while they sold shares worth about Rs 1,300 crore in the five other Sensex stocks so far this year.  Interestingly, FIIs have infused a net amount of about Rs 44,000 crore so far in the entire Indian stock market and more than half of this inflow has gone to the Sensex companies.  The Sensex comprises of 30 top stocks and is considered a barometer index of the Indian market. The average FII holding in these companies is about 20 per cent. The total FII holding in Sensex companies is estimated at over USD 100 billion.  As per the latest shareholding pattern data of Sensex companies, the FIIs raised their stake in HDFC, ITC, Reliance Industries, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Larsen & Toubro, SBI, TCS and Tata Motors, among others, during January-March 2012 quarter.  Besides, they also raised their holdings in Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, Wipro, BHEL, Cipla, M&M, NTPC, Sun Pharma, Bajaj Auto, Jindal Steel, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Power, Hindalco and Sterlite Industries during this period. So far in April also, the FIIs are not said to have indulged into any major sell-off in most of these stocks.  On the other hand, the five Sensex companies where FII holding fell during the January-March 2012 quarter included Bharti Airtel, Coal India, Hero Motocorp, GAIL India and DLF.  The higher exposure to the Sensex stocks in first quarter of 2012 coincided with a smart rally in the market, as Sensex gained about 2,000 points or over 12 per cent in this period.  The previous year was not so good for Indian markets, as Sensex plunged by about one-fourth and FIIs recorded a net outflow of about Rs 2,700 crore from Indian equities in 2011.  During January-March 2012 quarter, the largest increase in FII holding was recorded by housing loan major HDFC.  The FII stake in HDFC rose from 59.01 per cent to 65.81 per cent in the first three months of this year, while Tata Motors, ITC, ICICI Bank, Infosys, L&T, Tata Steel, Maruti, Cipla and BHEL also saw significant surge in FII holdings.

Sources in L&T said the company was insisting on addressing critical issues like getting the HC stay vacated on the works in the stretch between Ameerpet and Jubilee Hills, which is a part of Corridor-III between Nagole and Shilparamam, before claiming that all was well as far as the progress of the project was concerned.  HMRL took the media on a tour to Miyapur where it acquired 104 acres of land for the project, recently, after the high court gave its nod to fresh notification for the land acquisition. Legislators Jayaprakash Narayan and Bhikshapathi Yadav, representing Kukatpally and Serilingampally, through which the metro rail passes, accompanied the team.  A highly-placed source in the L&T said the company was not interested in being present at the event as it would convey a wrong message that the project work had begun when, actually, it was not the case. ""Preparatory works are not the actual works and people must not be confused about it. Our participation would have created that confusion and, therefore, we stayed away,"" said the source.  The sources in the L&T said the company was particularly concerned about the court stay on the works on the stretch between Ameerpet and Jubilee Hills as the court had made some serious observations about the modalities of dealing with the project when it gave the stay order last month. The court has said: ""There is a serious lacuna in the very launching of the project, under the AP Tramways Act, although it is almost a full-fledged railway.""  While HMRL is taking time to file an appeal in the court asking for vacation of the stay in the backdrop of the court's scathing remarks, L&T is understood to have expressed its concerned over the delay. ""HMRL's priority should have been to take efforts to vacate the stay instead of conducting the site visits that would not take us anywhere at this stage,"" said the sources in L&T.  Replying to media query relating to the issue at the site visit, NVS Reddy, managing director of HMRL, said the efforts were on to tackle all the legal issues pending. ""I would not like to talk about the stay order at this juncture as it would be sub judice. But, I am sure that we can convince the court that we are on right track and there is no doubt in our mind that the project will face any hurdles on its way.""  Sources in the HMRL said they were studying the court's order and would take some more time before filing the appeal as it had to be done critically well considering the court's remarks.  Apart from the stay order there are many issues to be resolved before handing over the entire Right of Way (ROW) to the L&T. While HMRL is yet to acquire 15.5 acres of land, earmarked for the project in Osmanaia University, the project evoked violent protests in Sultan Bazar area that comes in the.

LT,2012-03-24T06:11:00+05:30,Piyush Pandey,Our trucks are built to save costs for operators,"India Business News: Swedish heavy trucks major Scania sold about 600 trucks to the Indian Army sometime in the seventies. But even after three decades, the $13-billion co"," Swedish heavy trucks major Scania sold about 600 trucks to the Indian Army sometime in the seventies. But even after three decades, the $13-billion company is yet to replicate the same success in the Indian market.  Leif Ostling, global president and CEO, Scania, hopes to change that disparity and is now betting quite unabashedly on the Indian market. Indian engineering group Larsen & Toubro, with which it tied up in 2007, wanted the Swedish company to set up base in India in the nineties just after liberalization. But Scania was not ready then, nor was the Indian market, recalls Ostling, who joined Scania after graduating from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden when he was 27.  Scania, which morphed globally from a truck manufacturer for civilian purposes to a military supplier during the World War and back into a heavy truck maker soon after, is yet to cross the number of trucks it sold in India in the seventies. “You are never too late but need a long-term prospective to be here,” says Ostling, 67, when asked if the company was late in starting off. “Today, you have to be here if you want to be a global player.”  The company is on the catching-up game and is betting heavily on the “huge potential” of heavy trucks used in the mining sector. Scania, which sells 300 units in India, is planning to ramp up sales to 5,000 units in next five years and then to over 10,000 units within a decade. “India is an important market economy today,” says the Scania chief who is looking at aggressive expansion in emerging markets like India and China with the Eurozone crisis impacting the company’s financials. Currently, European markets contribute over half of its revenues.  Spelling his India strategy over cappuccino in a suburban Mumbai hotel, Ostling, who successfully staved off a hostile bid from German truck maker MAN in 2006, said that Scania also plans to enter the luxury bus segment in India — which is almost synonymous with another Swedish manufacturer, Volvo. Ostling, here recently to get a first-hand account of the company’s new manufacturing base in Bangalore, wants to demonstrate the same aggression to garner shares. Interestingly, Volkswagen now holds majority stakes in both Scania and MAN AG.  Asked if the partnership with L&T will be affected by Scania’s plans to build trucks on its own, Ostling says, “Not at all.” Of the 200 engineers working in our development centre, 135 are from L&T so they serve the intellectual side of our business.  Though costing substantially more than other trucks in the market, Ostling feels the demand for Scania trucks in India will be driven by technology and cost savings going forward. “Our trucks are built specifically for the Indian market and are designed to save costs for operators. A trained driver for this truck may result in 20% fuel savings, which is huge considering each unit requires one lakh litres of diesel per annum. Besides, our trucks leave 50 tonnes less Co2 in air,” he asserts.  Ostling, also an economist, was quick to figure out that 2012 is going to be tough year. He says Scania is better equipped for tougher times on all fronts compared to the financial crisis of 2008. And despite a weaker year-end, Scania reported record-high vehicle deliveries and service sales, as well as the highest earnings per share in its history. The two rounds of cutbacks in production at its units in Europe and Latin America helped. “We are not going to be left sitting with an organization that is too large, but will instead take additional measures if needed during 2012.”  On doing business in India, Ostling says the country is a complex continent with so many different people speaking different languages. “It has, however, set a good example of growth in the last 10 years. Though foreign investors prefer to wait and watch at this point of time, the situation here is better compared to the rest of the world.

The Mahindras said the merger was being done to consolidate the information technology, software and related businesses of the group into a single entity providing services in this sector. The merger is slated to form India’s fifth-largest IT player in the country in terms of market capitalization of around Rs 17,000 crore, or over $3 billion, with a headcount ranging from 70,000 to 75,000 people.  The merger of Satyam, which was established exactly a quarter of a century ago, with TechM also brings to an end the former’s saga though B Ramalinga Raju’s story continues as his trial is still on for having cooked the company’s account books for years. It also marks the fulfillment of Anand Mahindra’s dream to create a major presence in the IT arena because TechM was predominantly telecom-focused earlier.  The MSat-TechM merger may well signal the end of the road for the brand Satyam that took a major beating when the worst corporate fraud in India’s history rocked the company. The Mahindras had acquired Satyam on April 13, 2009, pipping other suitors like Larsen & Toubro.  “There is a strong possibility that the name Satyam will be dropped altogether in the merged entity, given the huge baggage of negativity surrounding the company’s history,” a source close to the development told TOI.  However, when contacted, TechM vice-chairman and managing director and MSat chairman Vineet Nayyar said that a final call on the branding of the merged entity would only be taken after the merger takes place and that an independent agency would be appointed to carry out an objective arm’s length study to decide on the branding.

Yes, if state urban development minister Firhad Hakim has his way."," KOLKATA: Is Bengal going to get the longest flyover on earth? Yes, if state urban development minister Firhad Hakim has his way.  Addressing a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) event on Tuesday, the minister announced that the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is planning to build a 100-km-long flyover from Garia to Bongaon.  Fifty-four-km-long Bang Na Expressway in Thailand is now the longest single flyover in the world.  If everything goes according to plan, it should not take more than three years to complete the project, Hakim later told TOI.  The minister said a survey is already on to look into the project's viability. ""Once this preliminary survey is done, a detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared,"" he added.  ""We have appointed Larsen & Toubro to conduct the survey. In the next three to four months, we will get a clearer picture,"" said the minister.  If the project actually materializes, it will significantly reduce traffic snarls along this stretch.  In India, it will be comparable only to the ring roads in Delhi which have a combined length of 87 km.  A huge number of trucks ply on a daily basis from Bongaon into various parts of Kolkata and the southern fringes. This flyover can put Bengal's infrastructure on the national map alongside Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Surat that have the country's best flyovers.  Once the survey findings are out, expressions of interest (EOP) would be invited for the project. ""A DPR will be prepared based on survey results. The project will be based on a toll tax basis and not on public private partnership (PPP) basis,"" Hakim said. Once the project is done, a huge part of the cost could be raised over a period of time through toll tax. However, the details of the funding have not yet been worked out.  The KMDA has chalked out plans for several new flyovers and beautification projects. Recently, KMDA vice-chairman and Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee had gone to Delhi to discuss the projects with the Union urban development ministry to get more funds for projects listed under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).  According to Hakim, ""this 100-km flyover project can be a reality in the next three years and can prove to be very important for trade-related movements.""  Hailed as one of the best in India, a 12 km flyover in Hyderabad was built in 2009 over a period of about three years at a cost of Rs 600 crore. It used the latest technology of pre-fabricated segments and overhead grid launcher, causing minimal disruption to the traffic along the route. So one may well imagine the kind of investment a 100-km flyover may require.  However, Hakim did not disclose the kind of investment the project would see and emphasized on the fact that a clearer picture would emerge only in the next few months  . ""It may cost Rs 1,000 crore or a lakh crore, and we have to figure that out from the survey findings,"" he said.  A senior urban development department official said: ""There have been talks for quite some time for a long flyover in that area. However, the details have not yet been worked out.""

The book, the working title of which is 'V to W', i.e. from Village to World, would chronicle Naik's journey from a village in Gujarat to the boardroom of one of India's most respected conglomerates. The son of a school teacher, Naik, who is nearing 70, joined the construction major as a trainee engineer in 1965. All that he aspired then was to become a manager. But as fate would have it, Naik raced to the top through hard work, ambition, courage and determination.  Another rejig seen at Reliance Retail  Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Retail is witnessing yet another top-level churn, the third since it was launched five years ago. Andrew Campbell, chief brand officer of Reliance Retail, has stepped down to move to RIL. Campbell was hired from the Thailand arm of the British retailer Tesco in early 2010. Gwyn Sundhagul, ex-CEO of Reliance Retail, another official from the Thai team who moved to RIL's consumer businesses comprising insurance and telecom last year, has already left the company.

Current chairman and managing director Anil Manibhai Naik will, however, continue as executive chairman of the $11.5-billion enterprise for another five years.  L&T will split the position of chairman and managing director after nearly a decade. It is one of the rare board managed companies with no identifiable shareholder in an otherwise promoter-driven Indian set-up .  Incidentally, Venkataramanan , 67, will retire in little over three years even before Naik’s new term as chairman gets over, which some analysts slamming the much hyped succession move as shortsighted . Reacting to Naik staying on as executive chairman, K Sudarshan, managing partner at EMA Partners, tweeted: “Shambolic and farcical succession plan at L&T . Seriously, independent boards are failing to crack the whip when needed. Not a good sign.” But L&T shares gained 5% to close at Rs 1,302 in a firm Mumbai market on Friday, valuing the firm about Rs 80,000 crore.  Venkataramanan will be responsible for daily management of L&T’s businesses, while Naik retains focus on portfolio restructuring, institutionalizing its different business units and developing the leadership team.  Venkataramanan, who is currently a whole-time director and president of the hydrocarbon business, will step into his new role next month, becoming the sixth CEO of the 75-year-old company. L&T’s retirement policy requires MDs to relinquish their position at 70 years.  Naik, who turns 70 this June, said that the search committee comprising of non-executive directors looked at internal and external candidates with Venkataramanan emerging as the best choice. “We hired international consultants to get us a person who would have good knowledge of our diversified business but they couldn’t ,” said Naik, adding that “he knows most of L&T’s businesses and is the best man to steer the company in these challenging times.”  An IIT Delhi alumnus, Venkataramanan , called KV by his friends and colleagues, has been with the company for 43 years, having joined as a trainee engineer. An ardent sportsman, he played a key role in setting up new businesses like defence and power for L&T .  The change in leadership comes at a time when the company wants better focus on its core businesses including heavy engineering, shipbuilding , software services and electrical equipment while exiting marginal businesses. Naik said that the company will start fresh search for Venkataramanan’s successor by January 2015 and will have a new leadership team in place by 2016.  Venkatranaman and Naik are L&T lifers—people who have spurned attractive MNC jobs and invested their careers to keep the company independent . “Great companies are built by people who stay. You can’t build a legacy spending few years in and out,” Venkatramanan said.  Naik and his top team succeeded in keeping corporate raiders at bay even when L&T was eyed by some of the most influential business houses like Reliance Industries. Naik joined the company in 1965 as junior engineer who went on to be its chairman & managing director in December 2003.

L&T’s interest comes months after Hexaware promoter and private equity investors — General Atlantic Partners and ChrysCap — mandated Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse for a strategic sale. The $600 million L&T Infotech’s interest is at a very preliminary stage and may not lead to a definite bid for Hexaware, said banking sources directly familiar with the matter.  Japan’s NEC Corporation, Hitachi and US giant Dell were approached initially to explore their interest. NEC and Mphasis, part of Hewlett Packard, went ahead to discuss a deal before the latter opted out last month. NEC and a couple of private equity funds remain as contenders in the fray but the sharp spike in share price in the last two months has upset plans of some potential bidders.  Hexaware stock has soared nearly 40% from, climbing up from Rs79 in early January to Rs123 on February 29. TOI reported on January 5 that Hexaware had kicked off a stake sale process with two investment bankers approaching a select list of potential suitors. The stock closed at Rs109, down 1.36% on BSE on Monday. Hexaware declined to comment.  L&T officials said the group is looking to scale up its infotech unit through buyouts.

Mumbaikars were relieved in the morning when they found bus, auto, taxi and train services operating smoothly. ""It is a busy weekday and I am glad I was able to reach my workplace without hindrance,"" said Pratik Gandhi, a Central Railway commuter.  The bandh did not have any impact on public transport accessed by 13 million Mumbaikars daily. BEST initially had hiccups and withdrew its AC King Long buses, but they were pressed into service by noon. At least 98% autos were on the road with a few drivers taking out a morcha. Taxis were present in full strength and fleetcabs operated uninterrupted. The retail markets, vegetable and Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) wholesale markets were also open.  BANKS/INSURANCE  The strike's impact was restricted largely to banks and insurance companies. The strike in the public sector impacted cheque clearance. The strike in public sector banks also impacted treasury activity in forex and bonds. ""Trading was affected as counterparties were not there. Also, work was not coming in from other centers. However, equity markets functioned,"" said A Y Shedshale, head of treasury, Bank of Maharashtra, a public sector bank.  According to the Reserve Bank of India, 2.25 lakh cheques came in for clearance, as against 7-7.5 lakh on normal days. The cheque value was down at Rs 1,500 crore, as against daily transactions of Rs 3,000-4,000 crore with 94 out of 95 banks participating. State Bank of Indian officers did not participate in the strike.  The Maharashtra State Bank Employees Federation said over 10 lakh working in 70,000 offices struck work. Besides public sector banks, old private banks, cooperative banks and regional rural banks were affected. Some branches of foreign banks, such as HSBC, Citi and StanChart, also did not function.  In the insurance sector, Life Insurance Corporation offices were affected as Class III employees who were part of unions participated in the strike. Private sector insurance companies functioned besides SBI Life and SBI General Insurance. Two large engineering companies, Larsen & Toubro and Siemens declared a holiday on account of the strike.  PORTS  Work in port areas, especially JNPT at Nhava Sheva, was badly hit. More than 3,000 truckers parked vehicles near the port, with business losses running into crores of rupees.  RESTAURANTS AND BARS  It was a mixed response from the city's over 7,000 restaurants and bars. While some establishments were closed, most witnessed poor business. Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Associations of India (FHRAI) president Kamlesh Barrot said though members and associations within the federation did not participate in the strike, business in hotels was affected as many banks were closed.  TELECOM & POWER  Telecom sector sources said though call services, which are automatically operated, were smooth throughout the day, services normally offered to repair damages and faults were badly affected. In the power sector too, the business of suppliers was normal. However, MSEDCL sources said 5-10% services offered on the ground were affected in Mulund, Bhandup, Kanjur Marg, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Alibaug, Vasai-Virar, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, Ambernath, and Kulgaon-Badlapur.  THE MORCHA  As industries were hit, trade union leaders marched to Azad Maidan at noon to raise their voice on various issues. A R Golandaz of the All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) threatened another strike if their demands are not met in the coming weeks. He addressed a rally attended by 5,000 workers belonging to trade unions affiliated to various political parties. The issues were the government's inaction in controlling prices of foodstuffs/commodities, demand for implementation of labour laws with offenders being penalized, a minimum wage of Rs 10,000 per month for all workers, and social security measures for the unorganized sector, which accounts for 40 crore citizens nationwide.  Red and saffron flags waved in unison at the rally, as workers of the Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), socialist and Congress-affiliated unions mingling with workers of Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena-controlled unions.

In the order, the high court stated that ""there is nothing to implicate the accused with criminal conspiracy"".HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: After arresting Andhra Pradesh principal secretary (home) B P Acharya two days ago, the CBI booked two more IAS officers including a retired one in its chargesheet filed on Wednesday against seven persons and five real estate companies including Dubai-based Emaar Properties in connection with alleged irregularities in the sale of villas, plots and flats in an integrated township project in Hyderabad.  The other IAS officers include Acharya’s batch-mate and executive officer of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam L V Subrahmanyam and retired Andhra Pradesh industry secretary K V Rao –who took voluntary retirement a few years ago.  Rao is the son-in-law of former Union minister P V Rangaiah Naidu. Subramanyam also held key positions during the Chandrababu Naidu and YSR Reddy regimes.  Acharya, who had earlier served as vice-chairman and managing director of state-run Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC), was arrested by CBI on Monday.  The agency, in its chargesheet filed in a Hyderabad court, alleged that all the accused ""hatched conspiracy during the period 2002 to 2010 to defraud the APIIC and thereby Andhra Pradesh government, in the matter of sale of villas, plots, apartments and other ventures pertaining to the integrated project"".  Besides Emaar Properties, the other four companies charge-sheeted by CBI are: Emaar Hills, Township Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad (EHTPL); Emaar MGF Land Ltd, Delhi & Hyderbad; Stylish Homes Real Estates Pvt Ltd, Delhi & Hyderbad and BHLPL (Boulder Hills Leisure Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad).  ""In pursuance of the conspiracy, the public servants had abused their respective official positions and facilitated the private real estate companies to sell the villas, plots at exorbitant rates to the buyers, remitting only the documented sale consideration to a Hyderabad-based real estate company, and allegedly swindling away the unaccounted extra sale consideration received in cash,"" the CBI said.  According to the chargesheet, the accused public servants were also instrumental in fixing the lease rentals detrimental to the interest of APIIC. The villas and plots were sold contrary to the objectives of the integrated project originally mooted by the Andhra Pradesh government.  It said, ""Three private persons have acted as conduits to collect excess sale considerations from the villas, plot buyers and the unaccounted money was not reflected in the books of accounts of the Dubai & Hyderabad-based real estate firms. Hence, the same could not be shared with APIIC which had 26% stake in the project.""  The private persons chargesheeted by CBI include Koneru Rajendra Prasad, Srikant Joshi, Madhu Koneru and T Ranga Rao.  The CBI had filed an FIR against Acharya and others in the case in August last year. The Andhra Pradesh High Court had earlier ordered a preliminary probe by CBI into the allegations made by the then state textiles minister P Shankar Rao about irregularities in the APIIC-Emaar Properties project deal.  The chargesheet was filed before the special judge for CBI cases, Hyderabad under sections 120-B, 420, 109, 409, 477-A of IPC and Sec.13(2) r/w 13(1)(c) & (d) and Sec.15 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.  The chargesheet, however, did not charge Sunil Reddy, a key aide of Jaganmohan Reddy and MGF functionary G Vijay Raghav. Both are behind bars but CBI said investigations against them were still on and that an additional chargesheet on their role would be filed later.  The chargesheet said all people named had entered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat the state of Andhra Pradesh in the sale of villas, hotel project, golf course, convention centre etc in a prime land of 535 acres in Manikonda area of Greater Hyderabad as well as connived to reduce the stake of APIIC in the Emaar Hills Township Project joint venture.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/more-babus-dubai-rulers-aide-chargesheeted-in-emaar-case/articleshow/11720034.cms

Now, we plan to set up this factory to exclusively manufacture for ISRO. Their rocket motors are different from Akash, as the diameter is 2.8m and 3.2m and are massive. We will produce at least 10-12 sets a year which equals to nearly 50 sections of the motors,” he said.According to Patil, the industry and the ecosystem here were good enough to produce precision equipment. “Earlier, we were only able to produce at our facility at Powai in Mumbai that was set up in 1940.

L&T’s gross revenue grew to Rs 14,155 crore in the reporting quarter, a 23% increase from Rs 11,492 crore in the yearago period. “Despite several challenges, we have tried to do our best and come out reasonably well, though a lot needs to be done. Efficient execution of our orders aided the sales to grow by 23%,” L&T's wholetime director & chief financial officer R Shankar Raman told reporters here.  Order inflow rose by 28% Yo-Y to Rs 17,129 crore during the quarter, taking the size of the company's order book to Rs 1,45,768 crore as of December 31. “The quarter witnessed project deferments, aggressive competition, slow reform process and sharp rupee depreciation . Nearly Rs 15,000-20 ,000 crore worth orders we were pursuing were deferred. However , the recent increase in IPP numbers and easing of inflationary pressures, reflects some positive developments,” he said.  In last quarter, L&T had revised guidance for order inflow to 5% from 15% which it had given at the beginning of fiscal. When asked whether it would be revising its guidance given improvement in the order inflow in Q3, Raman said, “We are going to resist the temptation to fine tune guidance on a quarter to quarter basis.  Guidances are indicative of trajectory where our businesses are heading .” “When we revised the guidance to 5 from 15% the indication we were giving was that we are headed towards a flat year,” he added.

After a meeting with the CM, L&T's senior vice-president, corporate affairs, Shailendra Roy said, ""We can't buy land to construct our power plants. The government must give us the land or acquire it for us. The Punjab government provided us with the land when we set up power plants there.""  He was referring to the Rajpura power plant in Punjab. Representatives of L&T, which has made a major inroad into the power sector, came out optimistic after meeting Mamata, her power minister Manish Gupta and finance minister Amit Mitra at Writers' Buildings. Back to work after bereavement, the chief minister got down to business trying her best to woo the investment worth Rs 11,000 crore.  While the new government tried to get a major investment in power sector, given the dismal power scenario, the power minister shared some good news saying that NTPC was ready to buy around 400 acres for the Katwa power plant. The plant has been stalled as NTPC - which has already acquired 520 acres for the ongoing Katwa plants (unit 1 and 2), each with 800 MW capacity - was told that the new government would not acquire land for the project.  However, understanding that L&T power would foray into Bengal only if there was ready land at hand, the chief minister consulted land department officials and offered around 500 acres at Kharagpur. But then, Roy categorically told reporters, ""We would require at least 1,200 acres since the plants with minimum emission and with their super-critical nature can't come up in shrunken area. There must be enough space for the other elements needed for the plants. Space can't be compromised with."" He added, ""Power is a pre-requisite for any state to grow. We shall supply clean power which fulfills low emission norms. After setting up two power plants, we might add two more 700 MW plants.""  But Roy, finally said, ""It's a chicken-and-egg situation. We shall clinch the deal provided everything meets our requirement."" The power minister said the project would create 1,400 jobs, for the skilled and unskilled.  The government had earlier offered L & T 1,000 acres at Goaltore. But these plots were nowhere near a proper water source, power minister Manish Gupta said. Finally, the land offered was at Kharagpur. Even as they refused to spell out where land had been identified, Roy said, ""We will study the layout of the land and other infrastructure like water, rail connectivity and the nature of the land - whether it has been filled up etc - and then take our decision."" The company will inspect the area and submit its report to the power minister in a fortnight.  Roy said his company was in a hurry and would like to freeze the deal soon after identifying the land, but power projects essentially needed gestation periods. ""We will need at least four to four-and-a-half years for the plants to be completed,"" said Roy.

We believe, the dam will take between five and seven years to complete, which means, latest by 2020 the project will be implemented,” a senior water resources department official said.  Previously, the project was scheduled to begin only after the Sardar Sarovar project ends, which is unlikely to end happen before 2015. The project, which is projected to cost Rs 30,000 crore, will be undertaken in public-private partnership (PPP) mode by building a 30-kmlong dam between Kalatalav in Bhavnagar district in Saurashtra and Adalar in Bharuch district in South Gujarat. This is15 km north of the place where the dam was earlier envisaged.”  The decision comes close on heals of “Techno-Economic Feasibility Report (Phase-I) of the Gulf of Khambhat Project”, prepared by the Narmada, Water Resources, Water Supply and Kalpasar department. It envisages that the dam will store flood waters from about a dozen rivers around the Gulf of Khambhat as also by transporting Narmada waters via a proposed canal from a barrage to be built at Bharbhut on the mouth of Narmada river.  Before the project work begins, the state government has decided to construct the crucial barrage at Bharbhut in June-July 2012. “It will store Narmada waters and supply them to the Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region( PCPIR) at Dahej and to the nearby townships Ankleshwar and Bharuch as also villages,” a senior official said, adding, “Once the Kalpasar dam is complete, the Narmada waters will be transported to the Gulf of Khambhat.”  One of the biggest fairs of South Gujarat, which takes place once every 12 years, will take place at Bharbhut in June-July 2012. The BJP government does not want to miss this ahead of assembly elections, scheduled for December 2012.  Already, government sources say, major industrial houses, such as Essar, Hindustan Construction Company, Larsen & Toubro and Adani Group, have been roped in to build the barrage, catalytic transporting waters to the proposed Kalpasar reservoir.  When contacted, state Kalpasar secretary M S Patel said, “While a final order to kickstart the project in 2013 has not been issued, the way the studies are progressing, there is reason to believe the dam will start being built in the financial year 2013-14.”  Asked about economic feasibility of the PPP mode, he said, this is “perfectly possible” as a 10-lane toll road will be built on top of the dam to connect South Gujarat and Saurashtra, reducing the distance between the two regions to one-tenth. Further, about 2.30 lakh hectares (ha) will be reclaimed along the Gulf of Khambhat, which will be a major boost to the Dholera Special Investment Region (SIR) and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC).

A joint venture of Tata Steel and Larsen and Toubro, the Rs-3500-crore port project was built on PPP (public-private-partnership) mode and became commercially operational in May after phase one work was completed – the building of two cargo berths of 350 metres long each. The port is equipped for an achievable discharge rate of 600,000 metric tons per day and loading rate of 100,000 MT per day of dry bulk cargo.  Dhamra Port Company Limited (DPCL) sources said around 50 ships, including capesize vessels of more than a dead weight of one lakh metric tonne, have berthed so far. The port has built an 18 km channel to connect with deep sea and a 62-km fully electrified rail link to connect with the Howrah-Chennai main line for transportation of cargo, company sources said.  Naveen said, “We have added another feather to the glory of our state by establishing the biggest port in eastern India. We have successfully built an infrastructure industry to make multiple use of the abundant natural resources of the state.” He added, “The Paradip port was established (in 1962) by former chief minister Biju Pattnaik. We are paying tributes to him today by fulfilling his dream of an industrial Odisha by establishing the Dhamra Port.”  CEO of DPCL Santosh Mahapatra said, “We have laid stress on providing as much employment to local people as possible during the phase one of the port project. The port would have 14 berths after phase three work gets over.”  A host of dignitaries, including commerce and transport minister Sanjeeb Sahoo, tourism and culture minister Prafulla Samal, Bhadrak MP Arjun Charan Sethy, chief secretary Bijay Pattnaik and Union shipping secretary K Mohandas, were present on the occasion.

With the move to disinvest the joint ventures of APIIC like Raheja MindSpace, the various Emaar ventures, Hitec City, Cyber Pearl, Larsen and Toubro Info City, Hitex Exhibition, etc, the state government issued government order Ms No 119 on December 5 through which it appointed a four-member committee headed by the chief secretary that will “review the options available relating to sale of assets” belonging to the APIIC.  Outraged at the state’s plans to go ahead with the disinvest move, APIIC is to discuss the issue at its meeting on December 20. “I have not been informed or seen the GO.The issue has not been brought before APIIC. Therefore, we will not allow the disinvestment of APIIC’s assets at any cost,” its chairman S Siva Subramanyam told TOI on Wednesday. According to sources, APIIC vice chairman and MD B R Meena, who is member-convener of the committee constituted by the state, has also vowed to ensure that the assets of the corporation are not disinvested.  In all, there are about 20 joint ventures that APIIC entered into with private parties of which less than a dozen are said to be profit-making. “While the value of the assets of the profit-making joint ventures are still to be evaluated, together, it could be anywhere between Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 crore,” said sources.  APIIC sources also questioned the manner in which the state went about issuing the GO. With a view to mobilizing funds for the various welfare schemes announced by chief minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy, the finance department issued a note which recommended the disinvestment of the assets of APIIC in order to strengthen non-tax revenue receipts. The GO was issued based on the finance department’s note.  According to the sources, T S Appa Rao, principal secretary, industries, was opposed to the move on the grounds that such a move at this juncture when the real estate market is down will not fetch much revenue for the state. “However, when Appa Rao was away in the US, the state got the GO issued through Prem Chand, principal secretary, industries and commerce and in-charge of mining,” they said.

This is compelling General Insurance Corporation to push for purchase of cover from international markets which will require opening up reactors to inspection.  The Nuclear Power Corporation is set to take a call on insuring its plants.  On Tuesday, the General Insurance Corporation of India which has been tasked with the responsibility of arranging the mandatory Rs 1,500 crore liability insurance cover for nuclear plant operators made a presentation to officials of Department of Atomic Energy, Nuclear Power Corporation, and Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. Also present were potential entrants into the nuclear power sector such as Larsen & Toubro, National Thermal Power Corporation and IndianOil Corporation.  GIC also brought in international nuclear underwriters and experts from China and Russia to highlight how these relatively closed countries were allowing their reactors to be inspected by global nuclear pool agencies. Representatives of specialist nuclear underwriters explained how pool inspections also benefit the plant operator. In the insurance world pool is the term used to denote the underwriting capacity created by a voluntary association of insurers to provide cover for an eventuality that cannot be insured by individual companies. Traditionally India has been averse to inspection of the ‘hot’ or critical area of nuclear plants where reactions take place.  “India is at an incipient stage of private participation in power. We had a meeting with local insurance companies to create a nuclear insurance pool. But we have managed to get commitments from only 7-8 insurers for capacity of $78million as against the target of $320million” said Yogesh Lohiya, chairman, GIC. He said that the corporation therefore decided to bring in experts international pools to explain how inspections are not a cause for concern.

Expressing his gratitude to the selection committee and board of directors, Mistry said: ""I feel deeply honoured by this appointment. I am aware that an enormous responsibility, with a great legacy, has been entrusted to me.""  He said he ""looked forward to (Ratan) Tata's guidance in the year ahead in meeting the expectations of the Tata Group.  ""I take this responsibility very seriously and in keeping with the values and ethics of the Tata Group,"" Mistry said.  He also committed himself to legally dissociate himself from the management of his family businesses to avoid any issue of conflict of interest with his new assignment.  Mistry, 43, is the younger son of construction tycoon Pallonji Mistry and belongs to a family which is one of the largest shareholders in the $71 billion Tata Group.  His surname may not be Tata, but Cyrus Mistry is as close as an outsider could come.  Announced on Wednesday as the heir apparent to Ratan Tata, the group's long-standing chairman, Mistry will become head of one of India's most storied business groups.  A five-man selection team - which included the 43-year-old Mistry himself - spent 15 months searching for a successor to 73-year-old Tata, in a closely guarded process that had India Inc guessing.  In the end, the panel didn't have to look far. Mistry's grandfather first bought shares in Tata Sons in the 1930s, a stake that currently stands at 18.5 percent in the hands of Mistry's father, Pallonji Mistry, the largest single shareholder in a firm mostly controlled by trusts.  The chairman-in-waiting, who will head a group with revenues in excess of $83 billion, is brother-in-law to Noel Tata, Ratan Tata's half-brother. Noel Tata was considered by many observers to have been the front-runner in the race for the chairmanship.  Mistry's father, a reclusive billionaire with an estimated wealth of $7.6 billion according to Forbes, paved the way for his younger son's ascendancy to the top of a group founded by Ratan Tata's great-grandfather.  In Tata circles, Pallonji is dubbed the ""Phantom of Bombay House"" for the quiet but assured way he commands power around the south Mumbai headquarters of the Tata empire.  When Pallonji retired from the board of Tata Sons in 2006, having been granted a year's extension past the 75-year age cap, his then 38-year-old son stepped into his shoes.  According to Ratan Tata, he didn't let the family name down. ""I have been impressed with the quality and calibre of his participation, his astute observations and his humility,"" Tata was quoted as saying in a statement on Wednesday.  ""He is intelligent and qualified to take on the responsibility being offered.""  Mistry will be the sixth chairman of the group and the second not named Tata.  Two fund managers with holdings in Tata Group companies who wished not to be identified told Reuters that Mistry is relatively unknown in Indian business circles.  ""I'm surprised, yes, but at the end of the day he is not controversial, given his position as the largest shareholder,"" A.M.

Larsen & T,"BANGALORE: The Bangalore airport’s expansion of its passenger terminal building will begin next month and is expected to be complete by December 2012. Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has won the bid for the Rs 1,000-crore project. The expansion has become necessary as the current terminal is operating at full capacity. ""With the commencement of the terminal expansion, we hope to alleviate any hurdles being faced by passengers today. At completion, we envision an enhanced airport that befits the city of Bangalore, enhances its business opportunities, complements its culture and welcomes its visitors,"" said G V Sanjay Reddy, managing director of the airport. A spokesperson for the airport said a team has been formed to ensure minimum disruptions on both the passenger side and the air side during construction. The expanded terminal will have a capacity of 17 million passengers. A release from the airport said it would have the flexibility to expand to 20 million. The current capacity is in some dispute. While the airport’s private operators said at the time of its launch in 2008 that it was 12 million, a later assessment by the governmental airport agency, Airports Authority of India, put it at less than 10 million. The airport spokesperson declined to comment on the matter, and instead said the current terminal capacity is measured in terms of peak hour traffic and put the peak hour figure at 3,000. The airport handled 11.7 million passengers in 2010-11. Currently it handles 33,000 passengers a day, which takes the annual flow to over 12 million. The passenger traffic is growing at 18% annually, higher than the national average of 16%. The expanded terminal will sport an entirely enhanced design elevation, a response to criticism that the airport looks like a plain box, and does not have the external stylistic elements that the Hyderabad airport for instance has. The new roof design will also expand the weather-protected area up to the pick-up-and drop point. The Bangalore airport was one of the first private airports in India. Private promoters hold 74% stake (Siemens – 40%, GVK – 29% and Unique Zurich – 5%), and the government holds the remaining 26%. The airport said it is also undertaking a comprehensive review of the master plan. This may decide on matters like a second terminal and runway and the airport city.

Yet, every time a high-profile leader heads towards his or her retirement, there is anxiety of a certain kind.The issue of succession assumes significance as several high profile leadership changes are expected to take place in the next one year, including the Tata group, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and a few PSU banks.Concerns such as, should the successor be a mirror-image of the existing leader, or would they be able to steer the organization in the manner in which it has been so far, confront organizations. Management gurus believe that leaders should be chosen for the environment ahead, and not the environment in which the outgoing leader ran the company. They feel that companies should not restrict their hunt to a person who would be a mirror-image of the incumbent.""The assumption is: 'I am successful. So the next leader should be cut from the cloth'. Quite the contrary, the next leader should look different-not the same-as the current leader,"" said Vijay Govindarajan, professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. It turns out that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all formula for succession planning. That's why the Tatas have set up a separate committee of internal and external people to hunt for a successor to Ratan Tata. Similarly, through a committee process, Infosys zeroed in on an outsider, KV Kamath, to succeed its founder chairman, NR Narayana Murthy.While lauding the appointment of Kamath at the helm of Infosys, Govindarajan said most leaders can make mistakes while choosing a successor. This is particularly the case when a leader is successful, so he tends to choose a successor who looks like him/her. ""GE is a case in point. The CEO succession at GE is a textbook for others. Reginald Jones was the CEO in the 1970s, Jack Welch in the 1980s and 1990s, and now Jeff Immelt. These three gentlemen are as different from each other as you can imagine. It must have taken courage for Reginald Jones to pick Jack Welch and the same goes for Jack Welch in naming Jeff Immelt as the CEO,"" said Govindarajan.It is increasingly becoming imperative for companies to pick a successor who is different from the current leader. This is to ensure continuity in an ever changing environment. In the case of Infosys, the IT services industry had become extremely competitive. The key to its leadership position was innovation and out-of-the-box thinking which Kamath could deliver.In the case of Murthy, who has been showered with accolades like ""a visionary leader"" and ""iconic leader who put India on the international IT map"", finding a mirror-image was next to impossible. While Murthy was considered to be irreplaceable, the same was said about N Vaghul of ICICI Bank and JRD Tata. In both cases, KV Kamath and Ratan Tata have gone on to distinguish themselves. ""It is not a matter of a mirror image but of potential and performance,"" said Bala V Balachandran, J L Kellogg distinguished professor of accounting and information management (emeritus in service).The committee that is on the look out for a successor to Ratan Tata is facing a similar situation. A panel member recently said the committee was struggling to shortlist potential candidates and may have to change and rearrange the model in terms of what the committee was looking for. ""Our committee has come to the conclusion that we cannot find a replacement for Mr Tata,"" R K Krishna Kumar, director, Tata Sons, said in a recent interview. Tata will retire by December 2012, when he turns 75.A disciplined approach to successionWhile it relies solely on the management of an organization on how it wants to go about planning a succession, the trend of organizations setting up committees to look for a successor is fast catching up. L&T, on the other hand, is seeking the assistance of McKinsey & Co and Bain for a leadership building exercise. This is part of a larger mandate given to the consultants to help L&T's growth plans. L&T's chairman & CEO, AM Naik (69) is slated to retire by September next year.Clearly, this is not a decision that can be made overnight. Said Balachandran, ""The management must direct the formation of a committee to identify the suitable successor either from inside of outside the company. The constitution of the committee is of paramount importance as suspect reputation and lack of capability of the persons in the committee could completely defeat its purpose.""Experts said the committee must be given sufficient autonomy to carry out its work. What's equally important is that a certain unity exists in the thought process among the members with respect to identifying and rating a successor. Murthy's succession can serve as a benchmark. ""If every company is able to replicate the robust process of the Infy succession plan, they will surely face no problems in taking forward the leadership of the company,"" said Balachandran.There's also a view that the incumbent must alienate himself from the process. ""If the founder is involved even indirectly, there is an automatic element of bias that creeps into the process which prevents the committee from doing its job,'' said Balachandran. This is precisely why leaders like Tata are staying away from the process. Whether the process will be followed by founders of other companies as well, remains to be seen.

In an extraordinary event that saw more than a dozen US lawmakers embrace Indian businesses in a room deep in the recesses of the US Senate, India Inc presented a checklist of what it was doing for America in troubled times: employing 60,000 people across 40 states, more than four-fifths hired locally; acquisitions worth nearly $6 billion since 2005; hiring thousands of fresh US college graduates; all with the cumulative effect of saving thousands of American jobs. “Indian businesses remain committed to the US economy in terms of generating direct and indirect jobs to help in the ongoing recovery,” said Kiran Pasricha, whose 16-year run as the face of Indian industry’s lobbying effort in Washington D, ending in June on her return to India, was topped off with a 100-page study titled “Indian Roots, American Soil,” that examines the remarkable story of the rise of Indian companies in the US economy. The study chronicles the value Indian companies such as Infosys, Wipro, Larsen and Toubro, Ranbaxy, State Bank of India, Essar, Bharat Forge, HCL, Mindtree, Polaris, and the ever-present House of Tatas and House of Mahindra have brought to the US at a time of much American angst about free trade and flight of jobs. Reps of several of these companies stepped up to the plate to tell lawmakers of the jobs they were creating in their Congressional districts and states in an effort backed by the Indian ambassador, Meera Shankar, whose understanding of US-India business dynamics goes back to her stint in Washington as the chief commercial official in the mid-90s. The Indian claims were immediately endorsed by individual lawmakers, some of whom (like New Jersey’s Frank Pallone and Washington states Jim McDermott) are familiar India hands. But even legislators relatively new to India Inc’s baby steps (but growing footprint) in America subscribed to the idea of recovery through Indian investment . Jean Schmidt, an Ohio Congresswoman, was among those who spoke of how a Tata investment in her constituency generated 450 jobs, saved a building from being gutted, and improved the tax base in her district. It was the kind of positive sentiment that resulted in Congressman Ed Royce (California) kicking off his remarks with a hearty “Jai Hind” at the meeting organized by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) over the unusual fragrance in the Senate building of k a b a b s and s a m o s a s. America is hurting economically, and US politicians are only too happy to embrace help from any quarters, especially a country with democratic credentials and rule of law. From Essar, whose $2.5 billion investment in America, including a $1.3 billion iron ore pellet plant in Minnesota, employs 7,000 Americans, to software firms such as L&T Infotech and Polaris (500 and 800 jobs respectively in Edison, New Jersey), Indian companies pitched their wares to US lawmakers all too receptive to Indian investment.

The 103-m-long bridge will also serve as a second entry point for the city and help reduce distance by 1.5km.Chief minister Manohar Parrikar inaugurated the bridge over the Rua de Ourem creek on Wednesday in the presence of representatives of the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) and Larsen and Toubro, the contractor for the bridge construction.“The bridge is still half-built but its second lane will be completed soon. There are some difficulties, but work has started,” Parrikar said.The bridge will benefit students and teachers of People’s High School, Mary Immaculate Girls High School and Lok Chetna Primary School, as well as residents of the government quarters located in Bhatlem. Phase II of the bridge will be taken up after the existing water pipeline adjoining the bridge is dismantled. The GSIDC will also build a traffic circle at the bridge approach roads to prevent accidents and snarls.The pre-stressed bridge will be built at a cost of Rs 24.2 crore and includes a 1.5m footpath and a utility service duct. Phase I of the project has been built at an approximate cost of Rs 8.5 crore.“Since the time I became an MLA, I always wanted to have a connect from Bhatlem to Patto and even beyond,” Parrikar said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/neuginagar-patto-bridge-opened/articleshow/62059943.cms

This is another step by the company to use advanced technology in billing services.A senior MSEDCL official said that 25,000 meters would be installed in the first phase in select cities. They would be offered to consumers having second homes or tenants. Those having a second home where the owner does not visit it for two to three months is one of the focus areas. ""In the first phase we are not offering it to other domestic consumers or commercial consumers. They will be covered under the second phase. However, tourist homes in hill stations will be covered,"" the official said.MSEDCL has selected Pune, Nagpur, Pen, Kalyan and Kolhapur cities and tourist destinations Mahabaleshwar, Matheran and Chikhaldara. The MSEDCL staffers will approach the designated consumers and offer them the prepaid meters. The scheme is voluntary. If the consumer agrees the company will install the meter, which costs Rs 2,600, for free. The old meter will continue to exist for one year so if any consumer felt having regular meter was better, they could surrender the prepaid one.For promoting these meters, MSEDCL is offering a 5% rebate on power bills for the users. The minimum bill has to be Rs 100 per month. When only 10% of balance is left the meter will start beeping. The consumer can recharge the meter online through MSEDCL website. A further sop is that the users of these meters will not be disconnected if their balance is exhausted on all national holidays, Sundays, and second and fourth Saturdays.""If a consumer has a second home that he visits rarely, he can purchase a coupon of Rs 1,500 and not bother about electricity bill for next four to five months.""Meanwhile, MSEDCL has appealed to consumers of Nagpur to cooperate with staffers of Larsen & Toubro Ltd, who are conducting a door to door survey for compiling information regarding name of the consumer, address, meter number, etc. The project has been sponsored by central government under R-APDRP scheme.

The bigger share will go to the original land owner, the Yamuna Expressway Development Authority (YEIDA), which will pilot the acquisition process, has said.YEIDA chairperson Prabhat Kumar said on Monday the decision has been taken to keep prioritise the interests of farmers in the area. The authority is preparing a proposal, which it will send to the government fir approval, which moots giving only 40% of the total compensation to private entities who bought the land from local farmers within a three-year period prior to the notification of acquisition, whenever that may be. The rest (60%) will go to those who had owned that particular plot for generations. The proposal, Kumar said, will be forwarded to the state government by November 15. “We will recommend to the government to initiate Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act 2013,” Kumar told TOI. “Once notified, all land purchased from farmers by private individuals three years prior will be eligible for receiving only 40% of compensation. Our land acquisition policy for the international airport will be pro-farmer. No sale of land meant for the airport will be allowed after its notification,” he explained. YEIDA will also appoint a new consultant to prepare a techno-economic feasibility report for the project, which has been hanging fire for nearly two decades but got the Centre’s clearance earlier this year. Larsen & Toubro and Ramboll had prepared detailed project and feasibility reports for the airport in 2007. “The expression of interest for inviting the agency will be uploaded on YEIDA’s website by October 28,” Kumar said.Before that, a meeting is scheduled in Lucknow on October 25 on the airport project. Industrial development commissioner Anup Chandra Pandey will convene that meeting.YEIDA has also written to the state government to release Rs 300 crore for the land acquisition process.

Over 80% of the company’s revenues today comes from the engineering and construction segment. Last fiscal the company had net sales of Rs 37,035 crore. M V Kotwal, president of heavy engineering at L&T, said that the huge demand for domestic defence needs as well as the entry of more private players and foreign majors is driving the growth of the sector in India. In May 2001 the government had opened up the defence sector 100% to the Indian private sector, with FDI permissible up to 26%. Till then, the sector was largely the preserve of the public sector. Kotwal added that apart from business opportunities, the presence of huge engineering talent in the country is leading to more collaboration with foreign partners. Cassidian Electronics, which is the new name of EADS Defence & Security, and L&T, have formed a joint venture for defence electronics. The joint venture, based in Talegaon and Bangalore where L&T has its defence facilities will cover manufacturing, design, engineering, distribution and marketing in the fields of electronic warfare, radars, avionics and mobile systems for military applications. Around $20 million will be invested initially for the joint venture. “Along with the Indian integration capabilities twinned with our high tech products we will look to initially cater to Indian needs. Going ahead we will also use this joint venture to supply products to the global markets,” said Bernd Wenzler, CEO of Cassidian. Jayant D Patil, EVP of Heavy Engineering at L&T, added that L&T’s defence business, which currently employs around 3,000 people, will quadruple over the next few years. Patil added that the company’s product range includes naval combat systems, land based systems, missile systems etc.  ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lt-ties-up-with-cassidian/articleshow/7472794.cms

Each of the nine independent companies, which has been put in place with the help of international consulting outfits Bain and McKinsey, will have an eight-member board, including three representatives from the business and three external directors. ""L&T is a diversified company, comprising 60-62 units, and therefore at the board level everyone doesn't have the domain expertise. The new structure takes decision making closer to the business,"" said L&T's president and board member JP Nayak. These nine independent companies are in the business of power equipment, hydrocarbon, machinery & industrial products, building & factories, heavy engineering, metals & minerals, electrical & automation products, electrical and transmission, mechanical and materials, and infrastructure. Though the new structure will help L&T to manage growth better, Nayak said the L&T board will have a final say. For instance, the finance function of all the nine independent companies will be centralized. L&T reported revenue of Rs 46,900 crore in FY10. Unlike the Tata Group, where Tata Sons is the holding company for all Tata entities, in case of L&T there will be no such set-up. Nayak said it is a hybrid holding company structure, under which there are nine independent companies and five subsidiaries. The five subsidiaries include L&T Finance Holding Company, L&T Infotech, L&T Infrastructure Development Projects, L&T Hyderabad Metro and L&T Power Development. These subsidiaries have made the transition from being independent companies and are some like L&T Finance, plan to launch a $335 million initial public offering. Nayak said that L&T Finance has received approval for the same but is waiting for the right timing to launch the IPO. L&T, however, has no immediate plans to make these nine independent companies into legal entities, because of taxation issues, Nayak said.

After reviewing all the agreements, the Congress government would endeavour to rationalize power tariffs soon, said Jakhar.Jakhar further blamed the previous state government for the recent power tariff hike in the state. He said the SAD-BJP government had signed a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the central government and Punjab state power corporation limited (PSPCL) to hike tariff every year in the state.“Real culprit is Sukhbir Badal, who signed the MoU under the Ujwal discom assurance yojana (UDAY) on March 4, 2016, in the presence of his alliance partner and Union power minister Piyush Goyal, and agreed to hike power tariffs in Punjab on a yearly basis in order to implement the UDAY,” alleged Jakhar. He said as per the UDAY MoU, the previous government agreed to a 5% hike in power tariff for 2016-17 and 9% for 2017-18.Further, the state Congress president said the SAD-BJP government had signed PPAs with Sterlite company for a 1,980 MW Talwandi Sabo thermal plant, with Larsen and Toubro for 1,400 MW Rajpura thermal plant and with GVK for 500 MW Goindwal Sahib thermal plant. He alleged that by doing so the previous government had agreed to pay them exceptionally high fixed charges per unit as compared to other thermal plants across the country with similar capacity and technology.He said Punjab was paying fixed charges at Rs 1.35 per unit to Talwandi Sabo plant, Rs 1.50 per unit to Rajpura plant and Rs 1.93 per unit to Goindwal Sahib plant. However, fixed charges for Mundra thermal plant in Gujarat were 90 paisa per unit and for Sasan thermal plant in Madhya Pradesh was 17 paisa per unit only.Then minister for renewable energy and PEDA Bikram Singh Majithia and power minister Sukhbir Singh Badal had also signed PPAs with solar and bio-mass power plants at exorbitant prices, Jakhar alleged.He said as per the Punjab state electricity regulatory commission tariff order, Punjab is to pay Rs 1,010 crore for 1,712 million units (MUs) solar power at Rs 5.90 per unit during 2017-18. At the same time, the state has to pay Rs 776 crore for 1,459 MUs power from bio-mass plants which come out to Rs 5.32 per unit.Accusing the SAD of indulging in political gimmickry over the recent power tariff hike, Jakhar asked the SAD leaders to stage protests in Delhi rather than resorting to dharnas in Punjab as the Prime Minister and other senior BJP leaders, along with the Badals, were responsible for burdening the people of the state.Power tariff in the state during the previous regime of the Congress government from 2002 to 2007 was raised by 22.51% (average 4.5% per year) said Jakhar, adding that the SAD-BJP had effected a hike of 77.33% (average 7.73% per year) during their decade long tenure.Jakhar further alleged that the Badals had deliberately not operationalized the Pachhwara coal mine in Jharkhand allotted since April 2015 in order to oblige the Adanis as his companies were used to import coal at exorbitant prices, causing losses to the tune of hundreds of crores to the exchequer. He said it led to purchase of coal and power from private thermal plants and other private players at higher prices.He further alleged that the Badals had appointed K D Chaudhri as the PSPCL chairman for seven years and that he had acted as the henchman, causing immense financial loss to the state exchequer.Replying to a question regarding inaction against former cabinet minister Majithia, Jakhar said the chief minister had made it clear that the government cannot act without evidence merely on the basis of allegations regarding his involvement in drug cases and that there had to be concrete evidence which could stand court’s scrutiny.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjab-orders-audit-of-all-power-purchase-agreements-signed-during-sad-bjp-regime/articleshow/61312912.cms

Official sources said French firm Naval Group, Russia's Rosoboronexport Rubin Design Bureau, Germany's ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and Sweden's Saab group have responded to the government's request for proposal (RFI) for the project.  Spain's Navantia and Japan's Mitsubishi-Kawasaki Heavy Industries, who were known to be among the leading contenders for the project, did not respond to the RFI, the sources said. There was indication that Japan was keen on a government-to-government deal for the project. The deadline for responding to the RFI for the programme christened as Project 75 (I) was October 16. It is set to be the first defence acquisition project to be launched under the ambitious 'Strategic Partnership' model which aims to rope in private firms to build military platforms like submarines and fighter jets in India in partnership with foreign entities. The government is expected to soon launch the process to select the Indian shipyard for joint manufacture of the submarines with the chosen foreign entity. The project is being considered critical to counter the rapid expansion of China's submarine fleet. The Navy has been pressing the government for clearing the project. Engineering conglomerate Larsen and Toubro and Reliance Defence are the only private firms eligible to participate in the P-75 I programme, said another source. Defence PSU Mazagon Dock Ltd is also in contention for the project, touted as one of the biggest in recent years. Six Scorpene-class submarines are currently being built under 'Project 75' of the Indian Navy. The submarines, designed by French firm Naval Group (earlier known as DCNS) are being built by Mazagon Dock Limited in Mumbai. The project P-75 (I) will be a follow-on for Project 75. A total of six submarines are to be built under the Project-75 (I) programme. Under the SP model, select private firms will be engaged to build military platforms like submarines and fighter jets in India in partnership with foreign entities. A 49 per cent FDI cap has been kept for setting up ventures under the strategic partnership model for production of defence platforms and the companies will be in control of Indian entities. As per the framework, to manufacture major defence platforms, the select Indian companies will require tie-ups with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for transfer of technology (ToT).

A special method__Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS)__is being used for getting satellite images. These images would help and track the physical position and features of the routes.Official sources said the images would be taken at eight identified locations on the three metro routes__LB Nagar-Miyapur, JBS-Falaknuma and Nagole-Shilparamam. Special pillars would be constructed for taking images, which would be connected to L&T office at Hi-Tec city. Satellite images would be clicked till completion of the project.Also, other preliminary works like soil testing are underway. The process of geo-technical survey is to know soil condition and its strength to construct pillars for the metro rail tracks. For every 100 metres, one pillar would be constructed along the routes. Soil testing pits are being dug on the Uppal-Nagole stretch by L&T, which would be taken up on other routes too.""Once the works are over, the project developer will prepare general alignment drawings (GAD) for taking up the project. The GAD and detailed drawings have to be approved by the independent engineer engaged by the Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited,"" Hyderabad Metro Rail managing director N V S Reddy told TOI.""Once the alignment is fixed, L&T will put up signages on all the three routes,"" he added.Meanwhile, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has completed a survey for land acquisition along the three corridors. During the survey, officials have collected information on availability of road width, number of properties likely to get affected and extent of land required for the acquisition. The survey report would be prepared in the form of road development plan. Structural value of the buildings was also assessed during the survey.As many as 3,050 properties would get affected in the three corridors covering about 72 kms. Officials say for Metro Rail project minimum road width required would be 100 feet, while it would be 150 ft for major roads like SP Road.

The proposal to buy these stakes, which are in possession of the government, was made recently to finance ministry officials, who are looking for ways to bridge the yawning fiscal gap, two persons familiar with the proposal said.  The buyout, if it happens, could be staggered over months or even over two years, they said. They declined to add whether it was a voluntary decision by LIC.  The state-run insurer's proposal could help the government side-step hostile public investors, who turned their backs on a share sale by Oil and Natural Gas Corp, forcing LIC to bail out the Rs 12,400-crore issue.

Foreign investors, who bought stocks worth a record $8.8 billion in the March quarter, have net sold $71 million in May amid deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals and policy inaction.  LIC, which has already breached the 10% equity limit in both ITC and L&T, believes the purchase will help give better returns to policyholders, people aware of the proposal said. The government, though, is yet to make up its mind. An LIC spokesman declined comment.  Government Looking To Monetise Assets, But Market Unfriendly  The government, which is stuck between slowing revenue growth and rising expenditure, is looking to monetise some of its assets, but market conditions are unfriendly. Fiscal deficit is forecast at 5.1% of the gross domestic product, and the government will borrow a record Rs 5.7 lakh crore this fiscal.  LIC, fully owned by the government, could be directed to buy these shares, a re-run of last year's purchase of bank stocks by the insurer. LIC invested nearly Rs 20,000 crore in state-run companies to bridge the gap, drawing criticism that it was taking disproportionate risk and functioning like a ward of the government.  The government ended up with stakes in Axis, L&T and ITC when it bailed out state-owned Unit Trust of India, the nation's first mutual fund, in 2003.  The so-called Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India, or SUUTI, was mandated to pay off liabilities of the erstwhile UTI.  The shares in the abovementioned companies are leftovers after SUUTI sold assets such as NSE and National Securities Depository Ltd.  If LIC's plan goes through, its stake in Axis Bank will rise to 33% from 9.7%; in L&T, to 26% from 18%; and in ITC, to 23% from 12%.  In L&T and ITC, the insurer is already in breach of prudential investment norms and in Axis it would do so after buying out SUUTI's stake.  But the insurer is drawing courage from the regulator's silence when it breached the limits last fiscal in some state-run companies as it was treated as LIC's mandate to fulfil some state obligations.

As for individual corporate, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries and Larsen & Toubro paid Rs 1,306 crore and Rs 280 crore respectively, higher than Q2 of 2009-10.RIL had paid Rs 1,157 crore in the year-ago period, indicating that it is steaming ahead. L&T’s had paid Rs 210 crore in Q2 of 2009-10. Similarly, Kumar Mangalam Birla-owned Hindalco’s tax outgo doubled to Rs 140 crore. However, it was a mixed bag from the Tata Group as Tata Power paid Rs 60 crore and Tata Motors paid Rs 95-crore less to the exchequer vis-a-vis last year. Country’s financial capital Mumbai, which contributes a major chunk of direct tax collection, clocked over 13% growth, which a top Income-Tax official said was below expectations. ""Our expectations were more...some companies in sectors like cement are not showing good numbers,"" chief commissioner of Income-Tax Mumbai, P P Srivastava, said, after the advance tax collections for September quarter ended on Wednesday. The Mumbai region of Income-Tax department has been assigned a direct tax collection target of Rs 1,50,480-crore for the current financial year, which is 35% of the all India collection target of Rs 4,30,000-crore. Asked if the target (Mumbai circle) would be met, Srivastava said that ""we are hopeful. However, we will have to take extra measures to achieve it."" IT-major Tata Consultancy Services paid Rs 260 crore in advance tax as compared to the previous year’s Rs 220 crore, while the payment by Tata Chemicals remained unchanged at Rs 60 crore. Driven by high growth, advance tax payments in the auto sector were good. Bajaj Auto paid Rs 243 crore in Q2 of 2010-11, as against last year period’s Rs 170 crore, while Mahindra & Mahindra paid Rs 158 crore, up from Rs 112 crore, the source said.

Home-loans lender HDFC shelled out Rs 400-crore this quarter, as against Rs 320 crore in the year ago period. Life Insurance Corporation’s payout increased by Rs 128 crore to Rs 1,067-crore, while in the case of General Insurance Corporation, it almost doubled to Rs 92-crore.

Banerjee was killed in his flat in Navi Mumbai's Airoli.Police sources revealed that the investigations led the trail to Karad, around 160 km from Pune by road, from where one of the three killers was picked up. Banerjee's laptop was also recovered from there, which became incriminating evidence.""The young engineer did not have much cash in his flat on the day of the attack.

The Hyderabad Metro Rail project was first awarded in 2008 to Maytas Infra, which was then promoted by disgraced Satyam founder B Ramalinga Raju's elder son Teja Raju.But after the Satyam scam broke out in January 2009 following Raju's sensational confessions that he cooked accounts, Maytas Infra's operations came to a grinding halt, sending the landmark project up for grabs again.But then it was this strange quirk of fate that has given L&T's chairman and managing director Naik, who bagged the Padma Bhushan last year, yet another vehicle to make major inroads into the city of pearls and prove the group's mettle in urban rail infrastructure development.While L&T is involved with the upcoming monorail project in Mumbai, and has executed metro rail projects in Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai through the contracting route, the Hyderabad Metro Rail project is the group's first build-operate-transfer (BOT) urban rail project.As YM Deosthalee, group chief financial officer, L&T group, points out: ""Hyderabad and the Hyderabad Metro Rail project are very important for us as it is our first BOT urban rail project which has to be executed over 5 years and entails setting up 71 kms rail network with 66 stations. L&T has always been committed to building India's infrastructure in cities, especially landmark infrastructure projects.""Of course, L&T, which was founded in Mumbai in 1938 by two Danish engineers -- Henning Holck-Larsen and Soren Kristian Toubro -- and is now a multinational conglomerate straddling engineering, construction, IT, power, financial services, electrical and electronics, machinery and industrial products, among others, is no newcomer to Andhra Pradesh and Hyderabad.Apart from setting up several infrastructure projects in areas like ports, roads and power in the state, L&T was also one of the first players to log into the city's IT potential when it joined hands with the AP government to build Hyderabad's first software technology park -- L&T Infocity -- in Hitec City area.Spread over 151 acres, L&T Infocity boasts of landmark buildings like Cyber Towers, Cyber Gateway and Cyber Pearl and houses IT giants like Microsoft, Oracle, Dell, Motorola, Deloitte, HSBC and GE. This even as the group is in the process of developing HITEC City-II at Gachibowli and Intellicity at Nanakramguda in Hyderabad.It is hardly surprising then that the company that gave Cyberabad its landmark Cyber Tower, should now also be the one to lay the tracks for the city's much-awaited, swanky metro rail project.

LT,2010-07-15T01:12:00+05:30,TNN,Metro has mega hurdles to overcome,The Hyderabad Metro Rail project has not moved beyond the drawing board from the time it was announced three years ago and has many hurdles to overcom,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Metro Rail project has not moved beyond the drawing board from the time it was announced three years ago. So on Wednesday, when Larsen & Toubro Ltd bagged the metro rail contract, those in the know of things were not really ecstatic as they were busy listing the hurdles before the city's metro rail dream becomes a reality.And while things could be looking up for L&T for now, it will hit its first roadblock in the form of land acquisition. Hyderabad Metro Rail officials claim that 60 per cent of the land needed for the project has been acquired and will be given to L&T once it starts executing the project. They say that the remaining 40 per cent will be acquired soon enough.However, `soon' is a subjective term, say analysts. Take for instance, the three-kilometre stretch from Musheerabad to Narayanguda where 300 properties have to be razed as they fall in the metro project plan. In addition, considerable portions of defence land in the Jubilee Bus Stand - Falaknuma corridor are yet to be acquired. To make matters more complicated, even the National Highway Authority has raised objections against the Miyapur-LB Nagar metro rail corridor stating that a good part of this stretch passes through the middle of the national highway. The body has suggested that the alignment of the track be changed.Hyderabad Metro Rail authorities have also failed to get land from several goverment departments. ""They have been delaying it (parting with land) saying that the project is yet to be finalised and only after that is done would the authorities get physical possession of the land. They had doubts till date whether the project was happening or not,'' said an official.Another hurdle is the alignment drawings of the project, which L&T will either verify or get them done afresh. Either way, the time spent on either option would be considerable. Sources say that while half of the alignment drawings could be with Maytas, and L&T could purchase it from the firm, it seems like an unlikely proposition, say observers. ""The alignment drawings were made over two years ago and there could have been physical changes in the land such as a recent construction activity there,'' said an observer.Adding to the technical hurdles in the project's execution are the environment concerns being raised by citizen activists, who have even moved the court stating that the project would be disastrous for the environment. Activists have been demanding that the project gets an environmental clearance before it is executed. The matter is pending in the court. Another bone of contention against the project is the city's skyline dotted with heritage structures being permanently destroyed.Nevertheless, as and when the project takes shape, the metro rail project would have world-class stations at a distance of one kilometre each, frequency of three to five minutes and carry about 15.77 lakh passengers per day.

This was indicated by Vedanta group's chairman Anil Agarwal following a meeting with chief minister Naveen Patnaik here on Thursday evening. In 2004, Sterlite Industries had signed a MoU with the Orissa government proposing to five million tonne per annum steel mill in Keonjhar district. But so far the project has failed to take off. Sources said the Vedanta group, which is a leading player in the non-ferrous category, was interested in the steel project as its subsidiary Sesa Goa had iron-ore mines. Agarwal informed that a tripartite agreement for the steel plant will be signed soon involving Vedanta, L&T and Orissa government. Though he did not divulge much, sources said the company has started discussions with the state government to ascertain whether the MoU with Sterlite Industries would stand or fresh pact has to be inked. Agarwal said the first unit of a 2,400 MW thermal power plant at Jharsuguda would be commissioned by summer. ""We discussed about Jharsuguda (project); 5,00,000 tonnes of aluminium is under production, while construction for 1.5 million tonne is on,"" he added.He informed that Vedanta's million tonne per annum alumina refinery at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi district has started production by sourcing bauxite from other states, causing a huge opportunity loss for both states as well as the company. Officials said Agarwal requested Naveen to give administrative support to help the company mine bauxite from Niyamgiri hills. A company release said plans are afoot for establishing of 100-bed burn-cum-trauma care centre at Bhubaneswar, a metal park at Jharsuguda for downstream industries and a hostel for Government Engineering College at Bhawanipatna.

Surprisingly , the cost increased despite the number of floors of the tallest tower was reduced from the planned 24 floors to 19.A year ago, the chief minister had laid foundation stone at a grand event on a seven-acre land at Banjara Hills and now, the work tender for construction would be allotted by a high-level committee, headed by chief secretary Rajiv Sharma, on Friday . Infrastructure giant Shapoorji Pallonji is all set to bag the contract for construction of the over Rs 350 crore twin towers project.The company is building the chief minister's camp of fice and AP's temporary Secretariat. Hyderabad police commissioner M Mahendar Reddy told TOI that after the high-level committee clears the tender, an agreement would be signed with Shapoorji Pallonji before the work starts.Originally, the Hyderabad police had planned 24 floors in one tower and 15 floors in another and, accordingly a tender notification was issued earlier this year. However, the Hyderabad police suffered a setback as the Union civil aviation ministry refused to give permission to a 24-floor structure in the vicinity of an airport (Begumpet airport). As a result, the taller building would be just 19 floors and other building 15 floors with a connecting ramp between the two towers.When bids were invited, three infra companies showed interest and of them Larsen and Toubro and Shapoorji Pallonji qualified for financial bids. Incidentally , L&T, for unknown reasons, backed out leaving Shapoorji Pallonji in the race.Initially , as per a home de partment GO issued on November 20, 2015, the government had sanctioned Rs 302 crore for the project and now the estimates were revised due to time lag, escalation of logistic prices and other reasons. “Now, the project cost has been revised to Rs 350 crore.

While they believe that the demand will only grow in the future, this is unlikely to be the case,“ said Aju Thomas, regional head of real estate consultants Ciril.The sheer number of swanky, sprawling mall complexes that will come up in the up wardly pockets of the IT hub in the coming years is mind boggling. Around six malls are expected to throw their doors open in 2017 alone. These include the Maruthi Infinity Mall, spread over 1,95,000 square feet in Chandanagar; and the Sharath City Capital Mall, spread over nearly two million square feet bang in the middle of bustling Kondapur.Apart from these, mall constructions have also started in full swing in the Madhapur and Hi-Tec City areas, confirm sources.“There are malls coming up opposite Care Hospital and Raheja Mindspace in Hi-Tec City and a mall being constructed by Hyderabad Metro Rail project developer Larsen and Toubro (L&T) on the Hi-Tec City road,“ said Thomas.According to a report, titled 'Hyderabad Retail: Unlocking The Potential', published by real estate consultancy Knight Frank, modern retail penetration in Hyderabad will increase from the current 9 per cent to a whopping 50 per cent by 2040.“Several mall development projects, in the western corridor, that earlier hit roadblocks will also open up in the coming years. This will only increase the vacancy rate in existing malls in the city, many of which are already seeing low footfall,“ said an industry expert, on condition of anonymity.The gloomy scenario is further reinforced by research carried out by global real estate services company Cushman & Wakefield. According their quarterly report, the `overall mall vacancy' in Hyderabad saw a slow, but steady increase from 4 per cent in the first quarter of 2016 to 4.3 per cent in the second.“The vacancy rate for the city is likely to spike in the short run due to the high volume of upcoming mall supply,“ read the report titled `Retail Snapshot Q2 2016Hyderabad'.It added that several malls have “optimized store sizes to increase the efficiency of store performances“ and to obtain better rentals.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/it-hub-to-get-more-malls-but-demand-blues-in-store/articleshow/54648563.cms

Construction for underground stations at Government Estate, LIC and Thousand Lights on the four-kilometre stretch between May Day Park and AG-DMS in Teynampet started a few days ago. Chennai Metro Rail had signed contract with Larsen and Toubro to build these stations. Afcons Infrastructure, which is building the tunnels on the stretch, is likely complete work by mid-2017. The company is involved in building four underground stations between Saidapet and AG-DMS.""Work has begun for all the three stations. We can build underground stations after completing tunneling. We are hoping to finish building the tunnels by June or July next year,"" an official said.The three stations are part of the 18-km stretch on Anna Salai where tunneling was stalled for more than a year when the previous Russian contractor abandoned work citing financial crunch. Stations in underground lines are cut through the tunnels and work to construct them usually begins after tunnel boring. Work to complete remaining portion of the tunneling on the stretch began a week ago after metro rail signed a fresh contract with Afcons Infrastructure, an Indian construction group. The tunnel boring process is nearing completion with work in the final stretch between Thousand Lights and AG-DMS metro stations progressing in full swing.Larsen and Toubro had earlier bagged 889-crore order to complete the stalled construction of the line between Saidapet and AG-DMS. Their work involved engineering, procurement and construction of four stations in AG-DMS, Nandanam, Saidapet with other civil works. In 2011, Gammon bagged 1,947 crore contract along with Russian contractor Mosmetrostroy to design and construct seven underground stations for CMRL. The firm carried out tunneling operations over an 18-km length underground. More than 90% of the work was completed on the Saidapet-Gemini stretch and about 70% of work was done in the LIC-Thousand Lights phase when the Russian contractor abandoned work.

The move is expected to revive capital investments in Asia's third largest economy. But to usher in a healthy investment climate, corporate leaders are asking for more. ""A quarter of a percentage point is negligible. The kind of inflation we have today, at least 1 percentage point rate cut is needed to revive growth in the industry and demand in the economy,"" said A M Naik, chairman of engineering and construction giant Larsen & Toubro.  But the symbolic rate cut, however insignificant, has certainly lifted spirits. ""It is too small to make any difference, but is a big boost for sentiment,"" said Jamshyd Godrej, CMD, Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Company, which has diverse businesses ranging from refrigerators to forklift trucks and warehousing equipment.    The rate cut would have a trickle-down effect to increase consumption, but falls short of delivering the desired results even as the central government pushes the 'Make in India' campaign while, at the same time, grapples with fiscal deficit challenges.  Several companies have lined up huge capital expenditure, betting big on the hope that the new government would rekindle growth by easing restrictions. The $103-billion Tata Group has said it will invest $35 billion across its diverse businesses over three years. Likewise, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries intends to spend more or less the same amount in the near future. Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla also recently announced an investment of Rs 20,000 crore in Gujarat alone.  To ensure planned investments attain fruition, industry leaders are hoping Raghuram Rajan repeats the act and brings about another rate cut soon. ""I am hopeful that there will be one more rate cut before the financial year ends,"" said Harsh Goenka, chairman, RPG Enterprises. Goenka's worries are compounded by the fact that the cost of capital has become a concern for companies.  But as Venugopal Dhoot, chairman, Videocon Industries put it, what's important is the direction in which one is headed. ""Even though quarter of a percentage point is negligible, this shows that inflation would come under control and all other economic parameters are showing sustained improvement,"" said Dhoot, while adding, ""That's why everybody is happy about the positive surprise by RBI.""

Railways has set the target for kicking off production in the factory someti","PATNA: Work on the wheel factory at Belapur, Chhapra, is going on in full swing. Railways has set the target for kicking off production in the factory sometime in October this year. The trial production will start in June/ July. It will be the first major railway factory to be made functional in Bihar at an estimated cost of Rs 1417.23 crore.The wheel factory, which will be the second such railway factory in the country after the one in Bangalore, will have the capacity to produce about one lakh wheels of goods wagons, passenger coaches and locomotives per year fulfilling the needs of the entire eastern and northern regions of the country. The manufacture of wheels will be based on US Griffin technology, according to East Central Railway (ECR) CPRO Dilip Kumar.At present, wheels are being manufactured at the railway’s Bangalore factory and the heavy industries ministry’s factory at Durgapur in West Bengal. Railways has been importing wheels for locomotives from other countries at a cost of about Rs 3 to Rs 4 lakh each, sources said adding the proposed wheel factory would save huge foreign exchange being spent on importing wheels.The factory has a sanctioned strength of about 900 staff, including officials. It is likely to generate about Rs 180 crore business every year in the state giving a boost to socio-economic condition in the area, sources said.According to ECR CPRO, railways has almost completed installation of plants and machinery at Belapur under the supervision of technical experts of railways. Larsen and Toubro Limited has been awarded the work of installation of plants and completion of other civil work on a priority basis, he said and added the wheel factory will prove to be an asset for Indian Railways.He said while supervisory staff have already joined the Belapur-based factory, more employees required for the factory are likely to join in a month. Railways intends to complete building of staff quarters soon for providing accommodation to its employees and officers on the sprawling wheel factory campus, he said.The Railways has acquired over 138 acres of land for the ambitious project. This includes 52 acres for the factory, 35 acres for rail siding (additional lines for storing manufactured wheels) and 51.76 acres for constructing railway colony for its officers and employees, the CPRO said.Besides, railways would build a hospital, Kendriya Vidyalaya, community hall, shopping centre and staff canteen on the factory campus for the convenience of employees and their family members.According to sources, the railways would require at least one lakh wheels every year from the current fiscal itself. The opening of new freight corridors (eastern and western) would also require more wheels. Since railways has decided to run more goods trains across the country to carry freight, more wheels would be required for the goods trains in future, sources said.

LT,2010-08-09T00:26:00+05:30,Reeba Zachariah,Parsis' emotional connect with Tatas,"India Business News: In Indian family businesses, there is no dearth of successors. The Tatas, however, are an exception.","MUMBAI: In Indian family businesses, there is no dearth of successors. The Tatas, however, are an exception. As there's no heir apparent to Ratan Tata after he retires in December 2012, a search committee has been formed to find one. The hunt has fuelled speculation with the names of several global CEOs doing the rounds.The long list of possible successors include Noel Tata, Ratan Tata's half-brother, current PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi, former Vodafone head Arun Sarin and Renault Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn. Involved in everything from salt to steel and tea to telecom, the group has a prime place in the annals of both India's business history as well as that of the Parsi community. And what do Parsis think of the prospect of a non-Parsi at the helm of the $71-billion conglomerate?While some older Parsis TOI spoke to want one of their own to lead the Tata empire so that it continues to have a strong link with the community, others don't mind an outsider as long as the person preserves the group's heritage and legacy. At the annual general meetings of several Tata companies, Parsi shareholders have requested that the septuagenarian Ratan Tata should continue as the group's chairman. Jehangir Patel, editor of Parsiana, a community magazine, and a liberal voice of the community, believes that Parsis might feel a sense of emotional loss given the fact that the Tatas are an integral part of Parsi history in India. The loss will be compounded by the fact that the Parsi population is dwindling. The 2001 census showed that there were only 69,601 Parsis in the country. But what matters is not one's community ties but ""that person should be competent and have a strong social conscience"", he said. ""Anybody can have values. It doesn't matter if the person is a non-Parsi."" Yet, there are those who want someone from the family to lead the group. ""From the community point of view, the Tata name should continue, and if there is someone competent within the Tata family, there would be continuity,"" Khojeste Mistree, managing trustee of the Mumbai-based Zoroastrian Studies told foreign news agencies. ""They've (the Tatas) brought a great amount of pride and glory to the community,"" he said. On the sidelines of the annual general meeting of Indian Hotels last week, a Parsi gentleman who owns stocks of various Tata Group companies said that he would like to see a member of the Tata family carrying the baton forward, hinting at Noel Tata.But Patel pointed out several global corporations like Du Pont that were started by families but are now run by people not related to the founders. In India, Larsen & Toubro was set up in 1938 by two Danish engineers—Henning Holck-Larsen and Soren Kristian Toubro—but their family members have no connection with the present day company. Similarly, the Central Bank of India was founded by Sir Sorabji Pochkhanawala and was later nationalised. Those who remember the bank's Parsi origins continue to have a soft corner for it.Many feel that Parsis will continue to have a strong bond with the Tatas, especially because of its philanthropy and virtue that the community sets great store by. And it is a given that the group's social responsibilities will not change no matter who heads it. The group's charitable trusts lead in supporting various social causes. The Tata trusts earn huge dividends by virtue of their holdings in several group companies, including Tata Sons, Indian Hotels Company (Taj), Tata Consultancy Services and Tata Investment Corp. In 2008-09, the Tata trusts disbursed Rs 260 crore towards educational and medical grants. Jointly, the Tata trusts are the largest foundation in India. The Parsis have historically contributed to the growth of the Indian economy, producing prominent business surnames such as Mistry, Godrej, Wadia, Forbes, Poonawalla and Rustomjee. Also it was the Parsi community that pioneered the stock broking business in the country. They are also known for bequeathing a significant portion of their wealth for public causes. Parsis have a strong Mumbai link. JJ in Mumbai's Sir JJ Group of Hospitals and JJ School of Arts refers to Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy. The Petits, founders of the first cotton mill in India, set up several educational institutes, including JB Petit High School, in Mumbai. Even the iconic structure that towers over Dalal Street and houses the Bombay Stock Exchange is named after Sir Phiroze Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy, one of the bourse's chairmen.The man who sowed the seed of philanthropy at the Tata Group was its founder Jamsetji Tata. He established the JN Tata Endowment scheme in 1892 to support deserving students for higher studies abroad. The group's historian R M Lala, in his book, The Heartbeat of a Trust, notes that Jamsetji believed in using wealth in a constructive manner. In fact, Jamsetji was a contemporary of Andrew Carnegie and John Rockefeller, the world's best-known philanthropists. The Tata family poured all their assets into trusts, which today control 66% of Tata Sons, the apex holding company of the group.

L&T's special steel manufacturing and ultra heavy forgings unit at Hazira is a joint venture with Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL), in which L&T holds 74 per cent stake while the latter 26 per cent. The plant is being set up at an investment of Rs 1,750 crore, and will supply finished forgings for nuclear reactors, pressurisers and steam generators, besides heavy forgings for critical equipment in the hydrocarbon sector, as well as thermal power plants and steel plants. The unit is expected to begin operations between March and May next year. L&T is also investing over Rs 5,000 crore for setting up facilities to manufacture boilers, turbines, modular fabrications. It is also establishing a ship-building unit and a power plant at its Hazira facility. ""The boiler shop will be opened in March or April this year, which will be followed by the turbine shop in August or so,"" Naik said.

Despite the conflicts in the L&T boardroom, he never lost his cool and a","Anil Manibhai Naik’s journey with L&T began in 1965 as a junior engineer and he steadily climbed the corporate ladder, eventually becoming the chairman emeritus in 2023. Last September, he handed over the reins of this engineering-to-IT-to-financial services behemoth to SN Subrahmanyan. But, did you know that at one time Birla group and the Ambani group wanted to take over Larsen & Toubro? During his tenure, Anil Naik faced challenges from fellow Gujarati businessmen Kumar Mangalam Birla and Dhirubhai Ambani, who attempted to take over L&T. Defending L&T against these takeover attempts was a difficult task. “On one hand I had a role to play to save L&T. On the other hand, I also had a role not to lose them as our customers,” Naik told ET in an interaction. He didn’t lose either – Naik successfully protected the company while also maintaining good relations with the Reliance Group and Birla, who remain valued clients of L&T.Anil Naik's management style was characterized by being tough yet respectful. Despite the conflicts in the L&T boardroom, he never lost his cool and always remained gentle with his opponents. This approach not only helped him navigate difficult situations, but it also strengthened his relationships with industry leaders like Mukesh Ambani, Kumar Birla, and others.“It’s all about being tough yet being respectful. In 2003, Mr Birla and I finally shook hands. He got up from his seat and so did I,” he was quoted as saying. “Be it Mukesh Ambani or his father or Kumar Birla, I never lost my cool,” he said. “In fact I was gentle with them even when I was fighting them in the L&T boardroom for over two years. Each one of us were doing our jobs.” Recently, L&T received a remarkable single order worth Rs 25,000 crore from Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, to construct a refinery in Saudi Arabia. Anil Naik, who received the Economic Times Award for Lifetime Achievement, expressed his pride in this achievement. L&T's success extends beyond Saudi Arabia. The company has also secured a petrochemical order worth Rs 10,000 crore in neighboring Qatar.In 1993, AM Naik made a strategic decision for Larsen & Toubro (L&T) to expand its offerings by adding an Engineering, Project construction, procurement, and Construction vertical. This move proved to be successful as within four years, L&T qualified for seven out of the twelve clean fuel tenders it had applied for.Over the past 58 years, Anil Naik has played a pivotal role in transforming L&T into a true Indian multinational corporation. The company's projects span across countries like UAE, Kuwait, Netherlands, Algeria, and the UK.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-am-naik-saved-lt-from-takeover-attempt-by-ambani-and-birla-group-without-losing-them-as-customers/articleshow/108455293.cms

LT,2024-04-01T08:50:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Are thematic funds meant for you? Check benefits and risks,"Financial Literacy News: Thematic funds focus on specific themes like PSU and Infrastructure, offering higher risks and rewards. They are more diversified than sectoral funds ","Theme based investment sounds lucrative, especially if you believe that stocks in a particular sector are expected to do well. Thematic funds are one way to consider theme based investment. Let’s understand this better:As the name suggests, thematic funds are investments that focus on specific themes by allocating a significant portion of their assets to related stocks. In recent years, fund houses have introduced various themes such as Public Sector Undertaking (PSU), Infrastructure, MNC, Business Cycle, and Manufacturing funds. For instance, a PSU fund includes stocks from entities like SBI, Coal India, and ONGC. On the other hand, an infrastructure fund targets companies involved in sectors like construction and cement, such as Larsen and Toubro, UltraTech Cement, and KNR Construction.Thematic funds come with both higher risks and rewards compared to more diversified funds like large-cap or multi-cap funds. While thematic funds have a narrower focus, leading to higher concentration risk, they are still more diversified than sectoral funds like IT or pharma, thus carrying relatively lower risk, states an ET report.Investing in these funds can result in significant returns when the economic environment favors the theme, but adverse economic conditions can lead to losses in the short term. Also, the themes may take a longer time to materialize, potentially underperforming the broader market.Financial experts recommend that novice investors start with diversified equity mutual funds before considering thematic funds. Thematic funds are suitable for investors seeking to enhance returns and are willing to understand and accept the associated risks. It is suggested to allocate thematic funds as a satellite portfolio alongside a core portfolio consisting of diversified equity mutual fund schemes.Investors can choose to invest in thematic funds through lump sum or systematic investments. A staggered approach may be beneficial if investors anticipate favorable events unfolding over time, while a lump sum investment is suitable if they believe the theme can perform well at any time.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/are-thematic-funds-meant-for-you-check-benefits-and-risks/articleshow/108929314.cms

Larsen & Toubro’s Prayas Trust runs a medical centre in Chennai that offers free consultation, as well as more expensive treatment such as dialysis, for the poor.The centre started operations in 2002 as a small dispensary and moved to the present premises in 2012. Located at Virugambakam, Prayas Medical Centre, Chennai, caters primarily to the neighbourhood community with 17,973 patients. It operates a mobile health unit that covered 9,504 beneficiaries in FY2023.The trust also runs a health centre that covers 25,579 patients in Coimbatore. Besides, it operates two health vans that cover 29,496 beneficiaries in outlying areas, especially tribal communities. In addition, the trust supports the Kuppam community health centre near Kattupalli in Tiruvallur district, which reaches out to 2,303 patients, and its mobile health unit that serves 3,614 patients.“The healthcare initiative ties in with strengthening of public health centres where we refurbish the building, provide toilets and drinking water, add equipment and infrastructure,” says Mabel Abraham, head of CSR, L&T. For instance, every year L&T takes up two-three public health centres for renovation. “This year we have taken up renovation of one primary health centre in Coimbatore and one urban community health centre at Porur in Chennai,” she adds. So far, L&T has refurbished six govt primary health centres and two govt hospitals.Prayas Trust's health programme also does specific interventions in select community hospitals. “This year we are supporting the Thirumalai Mission charitable hospital in Ranipet, which helps farmers in that area,” says Abraham. “We are spending `1 crore to support the cost of building an operation theatre for them. We have also supported the residential wing and equipment for Adyar Cancer Hospital, the multi-speciality hospital at Kancheepuram, trauma care unit at CMC Vellore, and rural vision screening centres with Sankara Nethralaya,” she adds.The health project in Tamil Nadu ties in with the company’s sanitation initiatives as well. “The sanitation initiatives are taken up in schools and rural water stressed communities,” says Abraham. “Poor hygiene and sanitation lead to diarrhea, typhoid, jaundice, skin ailments and malaria. So, the approach is to cover WASH (water sanitation and hygiene) through an end-to-end intervention comprising awareness generation, behaviour change and construction of sanitation units,” she adds.So far, L&T’s total spend on health initiatives in Tamil Nadu in the current financial year is `5.61 crore, of which `2.52 crore is spent on the Chennai medical centre, `93 lakh on the Coimbatore health centre, and Rs 60 lakh on the Kuppam community health centre. Prayas Trust is a registered not-for-profit run by the women of L&T and led by Mrs Meena Subrahmanyan (wife of L&T CMD SN Subrahmanyan) as president.

LT,2024-05-03T19:59:00+05:30,Dipankar Gupta,The neta-janata divide,"India News: Politicians, always looking for a better deal in a tough profession, don’t want to be pinned down by ideology. It’s people who tend to acquire ideolog","Elections bring up memories. One of them is a quotable quote delivered by Dominique de Villepin in 2002, when he was visiting India as France’s foreign minister. When asked what it felt like to trounce the Socialists so completely, he came up with this killer line: “Politicians, socialists or conservatives, we are all alike, it is the voters who are different.”For example, while ideologically laden Congress and CPM cadres were bloodying each other in the streets of Kolkata, their seniors, Siddhartha Shankar Ray and Jyoti Basu, respectively, often enjoyed a drink together. Politicians are indeed alike, in spite of stated ideological differences, and hence can flit easily between parties making friends and searching for the best fit.The message is clear. Voters are driven by ideological convictions, but party bosses often rear up like nervous horses if burdened with them. When freed of all baggage it gets so much easier for professional politicians to switch parties. They behave as an executive would, when moving for a better compensation package from Larsen & Toubro to Hindustan Unilever, or vice versa.Once we get a hang of this it becomes easier to appreciate what Tom Vadakkan said when he left Congress. He clearly stated that as Congress spokesman he was just doing a job though his heart was not in it, especially when he was pouring pure vitriol on BJP. Yet, he stayed at his post as long as he did and ultimately switched when a better opportunity came along.Or take Nitish Kumar. Between 2013 and 2024, he went in and out of political alliances seeking a CEO’s position each time. While some may wonder how anybody can be so nimble, but as a professional politician can such a person be faulted? Voters are true believers and such turnovers could disorient them, but the politician is a hunter at core — a job hunter.In politics, ideological loyalty is weighed carefully against the chances of winning office. That is why a party flamethrower can in an instant turn into a party flameout. Even so, it is not as if such moves by professional politicians do not have a positive side to them. When ‘rebels’ desert they usually insist that their departure is for ideological reasons.Of course, that is rarely true but, even so, voters in that constituency are somewhat dramatically reminded of the party’s manifestos and of its professed claims. These had been lost amidst abuses and snarls of the election campaign and now they are suddenly centrestage again. This is how deserters from parties contribute unintentionally to the democratic process.Several corporate houses do something similar when they seek ‘exit opinion’ from employees who leave for better opportunities elsewhere. The thinking behind it is that the person can now give a fear-free opinion of the organisation’s work culture, which will then help the enterprise’s leadership to better finetune the company.In politics, rebel candidates also proffer ‘exit opinions’, but in a different format. These deserters often claim their actions arose out of a manifesto malfunction in their previous party. Six former Congress MLAs from Himachal joined BJP allegedly because of Congress’s disinterest in “developmental work”, thus forcing politicians in the fray to at least acknowledge its need.Likewise, Kota’s Prahlad Gunjal said he left BJP because the party had strayed away from its anti-dynastic credo. Gunjal is not alone. Karnataka’s KS Eshwarappa, a recent BJP rebel, has a similar complaint. Such protests should make BJP doubly cautious about family sycophancy.Rarely do party rebels do a complete flip as Rohan Gupta, former Congress spokesman, did when he said that “BJP stands for everything Congress once represented.” Did he even ask BJP before saying this? Gourav Vallabh, another ex-Congress spokesperson, left his party saying he treasured tradition and could no longer accept the anti-Ram Temple diatribe.When one time party favourites rebel, they often make it appear as if they are breaking out of jail. Suvendu Adhikari gave that impression, when he left TMC because Mamata’s nephew had undue influence in the party. So, even if defectors like Adhikari, Vallabh, or Eshwarappa are looking for an upgrade as professionals, their rebellion brings ideology back from the wild.The parties they have deserted are forced into damage control mode and must recall their manifestos, which they had lost sight of in the dust that election campaigns raise. This, unintentionally, gives voters a chance to rerun ideological basics well before they approach the polling booth. An alert party can tune in here and take advantage of such defections.This does not happen easily. To demand ideological fidelity would cause an instant nosebleed in politicians who have turned professional and who calculate their allegiances and accompanying perks carefully. Politics is far from being a soft-hearted ‘vocation’. It is a hard as hard can be profession and can smelt the toughest ideological metal to a pliable, handy tool.When Mr Gaya Lal shifted party allegiance thrice in 1967, he not only professionalised politics but also, immortalised the phrase, ‘aya Ram, gaya Ram’. Consequently, à la Villepin, it is the voter who carries the ideological can while the professional politician freely kicks it down the road.The writer is a sociologist.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-neta-janata-divide/articleshow/109822228.cms

Karan Adani, chief executive director of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd., at a news conference in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on November 8, 2023.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ratcheted up calls to boost indigenous manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports, creating business prospects worth billions of dollars for country’s conglomerates such as the Adani Group, Tata Group, Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and Mahindra Group.

The manufacturing facility, that is expected to create over 4,000 jobs, aims to produce 2,00,000 rounds annually of large caliber artillery and tank ammunition by 2025, and five million rounds of medium caliber ammunition a year later. It’ll also be capable of making short-range and long-range missiles.

The missile system was developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, the officials said.The Submarine Launched Cruise Missile is planned to be one of the critical weapons of the indigenously manufactured submarines planned to be built by the Indian Navy under Project 75 India, they said.The cruise missiles of the defence forces along with the short and medium-range ballistic missiles are likely to be part of the rocket force planned to be set up in future.Submarine Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM) is indigenously developed with two variants.The two variants are the Land Attack Cruise Missile (LACM) and Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM). Technologies like thrust vector control to turn the missile into and onto the target plane, in-flight wing deployment and in-flight engine start have been proven.A trial of the SLCM was conducted in February 2023 and met all the mission objectives with a range of 402 km.Indian industries Larsen and Toubro, Godrej and Sameer are partners of DRDO in this programme and are likely to help the industry to take part in future missile development projects too.India has supersonic missiles in the form of the BrajMos which has now capability to strike targets beyond 800 kms and has achieved success in exports.The subsonic cruise missiles are also expected to be offered to friendly foreign countries after they are fully tested and are inducted in Indian defence forces.

The trials, which took place between January 30 and February 2, achieved four different mission objectives using a revised robust configuration. The single booster, designed by the Advanced systems laboratory in Hyderabad, provided reduced launch acceleration.The objectives, including the safe release of the booster, launcher clearance, and attaining the required end-of-launch velocity, were successfully met. The flight trials validated various parameters such as endurance, speed, manoeuvrability, altitude, and range.— DRDO_India (@DRDO_India) According to sources, ABHYAS, designed by the Defence research and development organisation’s Aeronautical development establishment (ADE), serves as a realistic threat scenario for practicing weapon systems. It incorporates an indigenous autopilot system developed by the ADE. The aerial target is equipped with a radar cross-section, visual and infrared augmentation system for weapon practice.The laptop-based ground control system allows for easy integration of the aircraft and enables pre-flight checks, data recording during the flight, replay after the flight, and post-flight analysis. ABHYAS boasts minimum logistics requirements and is a cost-effective alternative to imported equivalents.The recent flight trials were carried out in collaboration with Hindustan aeronautics limited (HAL) and Larsen & toubro (L&T) defence. With the support of these production agencies, ABHYAS is now ready for production. It also holds export potential and can be offered to friendly nations.Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the DRDO, armed forces, and the defence industry for the successful flight trials of ABHYAS. DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat appreciated the efforts of the teams involved in the design, development, and testing of the system.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drdo-successfully-conducts-four-flight-trials-of-abhyas/articleshow/107432881.cms

Despite C","India’s ability to turn its economic expansion into corporate profits makes it a better prospect for investors than Japan or China, according to the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey.The powerful rallies in Indian and Japanese equities as China’s market has slumped have reset Asia’s financial-market landscape, providing global investors with three competing poles for regional allocations. Even with China’s attractively low stock valuations, and Japan’s progress in improving corporate governance, almost half of 390 MLIV Pulse survey respondents selected India as the best investment among the three Asian giants. The survey is a vote of confidence in India Inc. as the world's largest democracy is headed to general elections carried out over seven phases from April 19 until June 1.“There are many reasons to prefer expensive India equities over cheap China ones such as better transmission of GDP growth into earnings growth,” said Kieran Calder, head of equity research for Asia at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. A “better track record of delivering consistent earnings growth and supportive geopolitical environment” further bolster the case for Indian shares, he said. 109316817Key stock indexes in both India and Japan have climbed to records this year following a rally driven by rapid economic growth in the case of India, and the gradual return of inflation, along with corporate reforms in Japan. Indian equities now trade at around 23 times next year’s expected earnings, exceeding even the US, and outpacing the 17 for Japan and about nine for China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on MSCI Inc.’s indexes.The main gauge of Chinese equities has tumbled about 40% from its peak set three years ago as deflation and a rolling property crisis have weighed on the economy. More than half of the survey respondents said they expected China’s equity market to underperform India and Japan’s over the next 12 months.Indian equities attracted $25 billion in net inflows for the year through March, compared with just $5.3 billion for China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The tailwinds behind Indian shares include the growing population and optimism the growing middle class will feed into higher corporate profits.“India is the best market to own,” said Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager at M&G Investments in Singapore. Indian equities are likely to play a large role in regional benchmarks, he said. 109316714India's ruling party has committed to prioritize infrastructure and maintain popular subsidies in its election manifesto as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks a historic third term. The party has stated it will transform India into a global industrial hub and endeavor to make cities more habitable. Modi said he has already directed staff to begin work on measures that will be implemented when he returns to office.Indian shares now make up 18% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. China’s 25% weighting is well down from its high of more than 40% a few years ago.Infrastructure in India was highlighted as a particular bright spot in the survey by 41% of the respondents. The government has more than tripled its infrastructure allocation from five years ago to more than 11 trillion rupees ($132 billion) for the 2025 fiscal year. Modi is projected to invest 143 trillion rupees to modernize critical infrastructure in the six years through 2030.India's infrastructure and capital goods bellwether Larsen & Toubro Ltd. is trading at a price-earnings ratio of about 30 times. At the same time, other firms such as PNC Infratech Ltd. and JSW Infrastructure Ltd. are still trading at or below their 10-year average valuations.The South Asian nation has also fast emerged as an alternative to China for global manufacturing, with the likes of Apple Inc. beefing up its production facilities in the country. 109316826PM Modi’s party faces a national election this year, and he has made India’s accelerating economy a major part of his pitch. He is expected to return as prime minister with a strong majority to deepen infrastructure investment and manufacturing. Should he lose, it may derail the infrastructure and manufacturing push. Investors don't seem concerned though, with more than four-fifths of respondents saying the impact of the elections on markets would be negligible or doesn’t concern them.Japanese value stocks, typically larger and well established firms that trade at relatively cheap metrics, were also identified by more than a third of respondents as an attractive investment.One of the main reasons for the rally in Japanese equities has been the corporate reforms pursued by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.“Japanese companies are dealing with the TSE’s request seriously,” said Fumie Kikuchi, a research analyst at GMO in Singapore. “It means a lot that now corporate management speaks the same language that investors do.”In China, meanwhile, slowing economic growth, the specter of deflation and the ongoing real-estate crisis are likely to deter investors, according to Adrian Zuercher, head of global asset allocation and co-head for global investment management APAC at UBS Global Wealth Management.“There’s very little incentive to allocate to China,"" he said. ""We're still in a deflationary environment, and as long as we don't seem to be trending upwards — which would create more revenue growth — there is very little appeal."" The yuan is also seen underperforming the yen and rupee, which suggests there is the risk of a countertrend rally should the US dollar finally develop a downward trajectory.The MLIV Pulse survey was conducted among Bloomberg News readers on the terminal and online April 8-12 by Bloomberg’s Markets Live team, which also runs the MLIV blog.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-stocks-to-beat-china-japan-equities-despite-high-price/articleshow/109298522.cms

Because your dreams are about to come true.","If you have ever dreamt of running on a long bridge surrounded by the sprawling sea, then get ready! Because your dreams are about to come true. Riding the waves of marathon season in the city of dreams, L&T is all set to conduct the first-ever marathon on India’s longest sea bridge–the Atal Setu. Organised in collaboration with the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and the Times of India, the L&T Sea Bridge Marathon will take place on 18 February 2024 i.e. this Sunday, from 5:00 am onwards.  107779215Commenting upon the inaugural marathon on the Mumbai Trans Habour Link, Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, IAS Metropolitan Commissioner, said, “The Atal Setu marathon is a one-of-a-kind event where participants will run across the sea, connecting two cities. This inaugural marathon on the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link is a major achievement for the city's sports scene. The impressive bridge, a symbol of modern engineering, now provides a stage for athletes to demonstrate their resilience and drive. Against the breathtaking backdrop of Mumbai's skyline, runners will make their way across the bridge, bringing communities together and honouring the spirit of teamwork.”All you need to know about L&T Sea Bridge MarathonThe action-packed day has four exciting race categories lined up. The flagship 42-kilometre marathon will kick off bright and early at 5 a.m., followed by the half marathon at 6 a.m. and a 10-kilometre run at 6:30 a.m. If you're up for a shorter sprint, the 5-kilometre run is set to start at 6:45 a.m. For the runnersHere's a heads-up for the participants: Full marathoners, you'll need to report 30 minutes before your race starts, while participants in other categories should show up an hour in advance. For those eager to collect their bibs, mark your calendars for Saturday, Feb 17 (10 a.m. to 5 p.m.) at the Maha Mumbai Metro Coach Exhibition Centre.And the excitement is palpable. Nearly 5000 runners are expected to participate in the event. Beyond the runners, hundreds of people are also expected can still be part of the action by joining the walking event happening at the venue on Sunday. Atal Setu: The architectural marvelThe Atal Bihari Vajpayee Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, fondly called Atal Setu, underwent construction in 2018 and was unveiled to the public just last month to enhance connectivity between Navi Mumbai and Mumbai. Designed to facilitate the daily passage of 70,000 vehicles, this six-lane bridge is set to embrace a new role this Sunday. As marathoners dash across its expanse, it transforms into the longest sea bridge in India and the world's 12th longest. Offering an unparalleled experience, the marathon covers 16.5 km of the bridge's 22 km span, meandering over the sea from Sewri, spanning Thane Creek, and concluding at Chirle in the remote outskirts of Navi Mumbai.L&T, serving as the driving force behind the marathon, highlights the dual importance of the event. This marathon not only signifies a milestone in the company's history of building iconic structures but also underscores the significance of both physical fitness and environmental sustainability.  107779237SN Subrahmanyan, Chairman & Managing Director, L&T, emphasises the marathon's pivotal role in advocating for a healthier society. “For over eight decades, Larsen & Toubro has been engineering and constructing landmarks – the tallest, the largest, the longest and the heaviest. Delighted that we have now added to the list India’s longest sea bridge – the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (Atal Setu) – and with it, India’s first-ever marathon over the sea – the L&T Sea Bridge Marathon.”“There’s added reason for us at L&T to rejoice at this momentous event. L&T played a prime role in the construction of 21.8 km of Atal Setu. It’s a bridge in both literal and figurative senses of the term: it has maximised Mumbai’s city limits by providing a direct road link between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. And it has brought us closer to achieving Mumbai’s aspirations for enhanced economic growth and development,” he further added. While underlining the bridge’s impact in contributing to a more environmentally conscious future, the CMD said, “While boosting the economy, Atal Setu is also the highway to a greener future with a high degree of sustainability. Noise barriers installed along the bridge’s inter-tidal section will ensure that migratory birds are not disturbed by the hubbub of the traffic. And the direct connectivity to Navi Mumbai will save an estimated 100 million litres of fuel per annum, cutting carbon emissions significantly.”Complimenting the organisation of the marathon, he also said, “A healthy body is one’s most precious asset, and the focus on fitness benefits both individuals and society at large. The L&T Sea Bridge Marathon builds on the sustainability premise of Atal Setu by fostering a high level of fitness and a run towards a greener future. I wish this momentous event every success.”  107779261R Shankar Raman, Chief Financial Officer, L&T, echoed the sentiments of the CMD. “L&T has left an indelible mark on Mumbai’s cityscape by playing a pivotal role in the construction of India’s longest sea bridge – the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (Atal Setu). An engineering marvel, the bridge represents our ‘Can Do’ attitude. Fitness enthusiasts now have the opportunity to run their first ever ‘over the sea’ marathon and leave a footprint on this iconic bridge. This ‘not-to-be-missed experience’, being planned as an annual event, is bound to attract runners from all over. Looking forward to the excitement on 18 February!” As the countdown to the big day begins and the excitement levels reach a fever pitch, one thing's for sure – the L&T Sea Bridge Marathon is set to make waves (pun totally intended) in the world of running. So, lace up those sneakers, gather your squad, and get ready to embark on a marathon adventure like no other. See you at the starting line, runners!

The entire timber for the temple’s ‘Maha Dwar’ (main gate), 118 other wooden gates, idols and animals carved on artefacts has been sourced from the verdant sweep of Allapalli in Gadchiroli district of east Maharashtra, now infamous for Maoists and its booby-trapped hinterland. The Ram Mandir Tirtha Kshetra Trust procured the entire teakwood stock to embellish the temple from Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), a state-owned corporation engaged in commercial extraction of high-quality timber and bamboo. Earlier, the corporation supplied teakwood to the Central Vista Project in Delhi, DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai, and Satara Sainik School. Talking to TOI, FDCM managing director Vikas Gupta said, “The Ram temple Trust learned about FDCM from Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, which recommended quality teak from erstwhile Central Province, now Vidarbha.” Sources told TOI, there were three choices before the trust — teak from Burma, Vidarbha’s Gadchiroli, and Kerala’s Nilambur. After Burma teak was rejected and Nilambur wood lost out due shrinking species, teak from Maharashtra topped the preference. Gupta said a team of the temple architects, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE), along with temple trust members visited FDCM’s Ballarshah depot and were satisfied with the quality of teak. “We supplied 3,000 cubic feet (CFT) teak costing Rs 2.25 crore till now and more is in the pipeline. Transportation was arranged by L&T, which is executing the temple work,” said Gupta. On why Central Province teak made the cut, Gupta said, “CP teak is valued because of its durability. It is less susceptible to insect attack due to high oil content. Besides, the wood here is strong, beautiful and imbued with the right colour and texture. Easy availability and its large size to enable intricate carvings were other reasons,” said Gupta. The finished teak is now being carved with religious symbols on the first floor of the temple and other places in Ayodhya. Gupta, however, said FDCM is yet to receive an invite for the mega inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 22. FDCM regional manager Sumit Kumar recalled that the first team from Ayodhya visited Allapalli in January this year. “The team was meticulous about the selection of wood. Trust members and executing firms, craftsmen, architects, and quality controllers were also present. The team checked every sawed piece for quality and shortlisted the best pieces for final use,” Kumar said.","Nagpur: The Ram Temple in Ayodhya, slated to be a unique architectural and engineering marvel, will bear the imprint of the dense Dandakaranya forests, where the Lord spent time during his exile.

Investors gained a significant amount of wealth in just four days of the stock market rally, as BSE Sensex crossed the historic 72,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday. This surge was fueled by positive sentiments about India's macroeconomic fundamentals and strong global market trends.

The anti-drone tech is neede","The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) recently sought interest from companies to develop anti-drone technology. Now, a report by The Hindu has revealed that DRDO has asked BEL, Larsen and Toubro, and Adani Group to develop the tech. In its expression of interest, DRDO detailed how anti-drone tech works and why it is needed. “To mitigate and negate the impact of drones, there is a requirement to develop and deploy counter drone systems for detection, deterrence and destruction of incoming drone threats,” said DRDO in the EOI letter. As per DRDO, considering the unique nature of drones in terms of speed, size, hovering capability and resemblance to birds, no sensor system in standalone will be able to provide sufficient detection, tracking and identification capability to guarantee a reliableand effective defence against threats from drones. Conventional air defence solutions presently available with the country, which are designed to detect large, fast moving aerial objects, are not effective against small, low flying and slow-moving drones. “Therefore, a combination of several types of detection capabilities including emission and reflection of microwave, infrared, visible light etc are required to detect and identify drones,” noted DRDO.How does a counter drone system work?A counter-drone system is designed to detect, track, and identify airborne drones through the utilisation of diverse sensors. It facilitates the seamless transfer of this information to affiliated systems, enabling the deployment of counter techniques to thwart their intended operations. These countermeasures include soft kill methods to disrupt functionality and hard kill options for the outright destruction of the detected drones, as per DRDO The system can detect, identify and neutralise different types of drones including Small Hybrid UAVs, Micro UAV/ Multi rotor, and Nano UAVs. The Counter Drone System comprises several integral components to effectively neutralise airborne threats. Firstly, it incorporates a state-of-the-art drone detection and tracking radar, ensuring precise monitoring of aerial targets. Complementing this radar capability, a day and night camera equipped with laser ranging technology enhances the system's proficiency in detecting and tracking drones. To implement soft kill measures, the system features a Communication Channel Detection & Jamming system, effectively disrupting the communication channels of the targeted drones. Additionally, a GPS Jamming/Spoofing System is integrated, further impeding the drones' capabilities through GPS interference. For more decisive actions, a Laser Directed Energy Weapon System is included to execute hard kill strategies. Centralising control and coordination, the Command & Control Centre (C3) serves as the nerve center of the system, empowered by a reliable power source to ensure the seamless operation of the entire counter-drone system.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/drdo-develops-anti-drone-tech-to-work-with-bel-and-other-private-companies/articleshow/106682783.cms

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the names of four Indian astronauts for the country's first crewed mission in 2025. The government is finalizing regulations to encourage foreign investment in rocket and satellite manufacturing. The new policy promises to simplify the approval process and provide clarity for local companies seeking to expand in the space industry. Indian space startups have raised $5.,"India’s national space program has notched up some impressive accomplishments, such as the first landing near the south pole of the moon last year, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week announced the names of four Indian astronauts for the country’s first crewed mission in 2025.But the private sector hasn’t had the same level of success, with Indian startups trailing their counterparts in China. Eager to turn that around ahead of national elections expected in April and May, Modi’s cabinet last week approved rules designed to encourage foreign investment in rocket and satellite manufacturing.108041804That’s just the beginning, according to one of Modi’s top space officials. The government is finalizing a sweeping set of regulations for the country’s burgeoning space sector, said Pawan Goenka, chairman of the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre, known as IN-SPACe.“Everything will be defined: What can be done, what restrictions there will be, authorization processes, vendor policy, supply chain management and other factors,” Goenka said in an interview with Bloomberg News.— narendramodi (@narendramodi) While the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is one of the top national space agencies in the world, the private sector was slow to develop because the government allowed only a few vendors and manufacturers to participate. Over the past five years, though, Modi’s government made several policy changes to open up the space industry to the private sector.The 150-page comprehensive “norms, guideline and procedure” document will provide the private sector with guidelines and guardrails, Goenka said.That could remove uncertainty for local companies seeking to expand in rocket manufacturing, satellite software and other space services, according to AK Bhatt, director general of the Indian Space Association. The new policy promises to simplify the approval process by reducing the number of government agencies that need to sign off on projects, he said.“The regulations could bring a single-window clearance for all companies and players interested in space,” said Bhatt. “The industry needs clarity on the processes for entering into rocket manufacturing and satellite services.” One company already taking advantage of the new opportunities is Larsen & Toubro Ltd. The Mumbai-based group is a partner with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. in a consortium that won a contract in 2022 to build five Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles, a 44-meter-high (144 feet) rocket with a maximum payload of 1.75 metric tons that for three decades has been a workhorse for Isro.The first PSLV made with private-sector involvement is on schedule to be delivered in mid-2024.Other companies should expect to get opportunities, too, said Goenka. His agency last year began soliciting bids for private companies to manufacture another rocket, the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle, designed by ISRO to launch payloads weighing as much as 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). 108090469The government also wants companies involved in the manufacturing of India’s biggest rocket, the 52-meter-high Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, he said.Since 2020, Indian space startups have collectively raised $5.1 billion in equity funding, according to New York-based venture capital firm Space Capital. One of the top startups, Skyroot Aerospace Pvt Ltd, conducted the first sub-orbital launch by a private sector Indian company in 2022 and the Hyderabad-headquartered company has plans for an orbital launch this year. Another, Agnikul Cosmos, has said it will have the maiden launch of its rocket this month.While several new Chinese companies have sent rockets into orbit, no Indian startup has managed that so far. China also has far more launches, by both state-owned and private companies: Since the start of 2020, India has launched only 16 space missions compared to 226 by China, according to Virginia-based analytics and engineering firm Bryce Space and Technology.Isro is trying to help the startups by easing launch bottlenecks.The agency has two launchpads at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and is building a second launch complex in Kulasekarapattinam, located nearly 180 kilometers (112 miles) from the southernmost tip of the country. Scheduled to open next year, the new site will be for both government and commercial satellite launches, according to Goenka. “Once the second launch complex is ready, we will have the capacity to launch one rocket a week,” he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-modi-govt-tries-to-boost-space-startups-close-gap-with-china/articleshow/108088665.cms

However, the deadline was extended multiple times. Three companies submitted their bids for the project: J Kumar Infra Projects Limited, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Ltd, and Afcons Infrastructure Limited. Ultimately, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) secured the contract as the lowest bidder. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 1,959 crores.The BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) made an official announcement through Twitter, stating that the elevated road project, which is 45 meters wide and 5 kilometers long, will connect Dahisar (West) to Bhayander (West). This development is a significant milestone in the project's progress.It is worth noting that L&T is currently working on two segments of the BMC's Mumbai Coastal Road project in South Mumbai, divided into three phases. They are responsible for the construction of the stretch from Priyadarshani Park to Baroda Palace, as well as the twin tunnel construction from Princess Street flyover to Priyadarshani Park at Napensea Road.The proposed elevated road will have two sections: 1.5km within the limits of Mumbai and 3.5km within the jurisdiction of the Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation (MBMC). The project is being jointly implemented by the BMC and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on behalf of MBMC.In addition to decongesting traffic at Dahisar check naka, the project involves construction in challenging environments like marine areas, intertidal zones, and creeks. It will feature the construction of bridges, roads with new pavements, underpasses, and interchanges based on the BMC's alignment plan.The spaces between project segments will host multi-level seven-storey mechanized parking lots, and a bus terminal is proposed at the basement to create a multi-modal transport hub, along with an adjoining metro station. The project aims to provide 550 parking spaces for commuters.As the appointed contractor, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) will be responsible for obtaining permissions from various authorities, including the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), Salt Pan Commissioner, and the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEF & CC).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/lt-to-construct-bmcs-ambitious-dahisar-bhayander-link-road/articleshow/102108447.cms

The optimism seeped into the nation’s stock markets, which have advanced in all but one year since Modi first came to power in 2014. The enthusiasm has waned a bit this month, with foreign investors taking out more than $2.6 billion from local equities. The Feb. 1 budget is an interim one until a new administration takes office. It will still be keenly followed as the proposals would provide an indication on the government’s assessment of the economy, with Modi widely expected to win a third term in the elections due around April-May.Here are some of the sectors and stocks that traders will be watching for in the budget:Infrastructure SpendingDevelopment of highways, tunnels and power plants is among the key focus areas for the government, which has more than doubled its capital spending over the last three years. Shares of industrial and capital goods firms, from engineering behemoth Larsen & Toubro to billionaire Gautam Adani’s eponymous conglomerate, have been the major beneficiaries of this policy push. BSE Ltd.’s sectoral gauges of industrial and capital goods firms have rallied more than 70% in the last one year, beating a 17% advance in the benchmark index.“A lot of the market performance has come from the capex cycle, equity investors would want to see that momentum continue,” Vinit Sambre, head of equities at DSP Mutual Fund, said by phone. “Any guidance on the capex path will be closely watched.”Rural SpendingThe budget is also expected to include proposals to boost rural consumption and raise spending on welfare measures for farmers, women and the poor. Consumption in the rural areas, where nearly two-third of the country’s people live, has slowed, mainly due to scant rainfall in some provinces and as a ban on export of key farm produce also hurt farm incomes. The interim budget may aim at providing more support to rural consumption as it has been a “weak spot”, said Mihir Vora, chief investment officer at Trust Asset Management Pvt. Apart from income-boosting measures, economists expect the budget to consider higher subsidies for cooking gas and provide more funds for affordable housing.Asset SaleThe government is set to miss its disinvestment target for a fifth straight year, raising expectations it may announce a new privatization strategy. Shares of state-run enterprises have seeing stellar gain in anticipation of a renewed push for asset sale after the polls. “The government hasn’t been able to meet much of its divestment target in the last two years. With some of these stocks rallying, divestment plan will be worth watching,” said Sonam Srivastava, a fund manager at Wright Research & Capital.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/stocks-likely-to-benefit-from-indias-2024-interim-union-budget/articleshow/107285510.cms

Indian officials are currently evaluating competing bids to build six of the vessels in the country, senior Indian officials aware of the developments said, asking not to be named because discussions are private. One bid is from Germany’s Thyssenkrupp AG along with Mumbai-based Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, with the other was submitted by Spain’s Navantia in partnership with private shipyard Larsen & Toubro, the people said.Indian Navy will go for the best and largest transfer of technology that is being offered, the people said. When announcing the tender in July, the ministry of defense said it expected substantial technology transfer to Indian shipyards apart from providing the submarines with air independent propulsion — a technology that helps conventional vessels stay underwater for longer. India is looking for a reliable alternative for military hardware as supplies from Russia, its biggest source of weapons, is mired in a protracted war in Ukraine and faces sanctions from the US and its allies. India, which is part of the so-called Quad grouping that includes Japan, US and Australia, is also projecting itself as a manufacturing hub and pushing for technology transfers to build complex defense platforms such as fighter aircraft and submarines.The ministry of defense, Larsen & Toubro, and MDL did not respond to requests for comment. Thyssenkrupp confirmed the bid and referred to a June 7 statement while Navantia didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment. As Beijing has ramped up its naval capacity in recent years, India’s aging fleet of submarines is no longer seen as enough to discourage China’s presence in the Indian Ocean. India’s navy needs a minimum of 24 conventional submarines, the government in New Delhi has said, but currently has only has 16.

And yet, the reality this year is otherwise.The pursuit of lucrative jobs has hit a roadblock this placement season at the IITs. With companies scaling back on hiring and offering lower salary packages, students at the tail-end – those that haven’t been placed yet – are being offered annual packages even below Rs 10L.In the past there were several organisations that usually picked half-a-dozen students; this time though it’s one or two at best, forcing colleges to reach out to more companies. And many of those are offering a maximum annual compensation of Rs 10-15 L, well below the average annual salary.In 2022-23, the average package computed at the end of the placement season for IIT Bombay stood at Rs 21.82L per annum. In 2021-22, it was Rs 21.5L, and in 2020-21, it was Rs 17.91L.Some students who have bagged campus jobs at what they believe is a lower pay scale, are still in the market looking for better prospects.“The global economic slowdown has significantly impacted the campus placements for the 2024 graduating batch of IIT Indore. The reduced hiring numbers of recruiters compared to the previous year have resulted in a challenging placement season. To offset the impact, IIT Indore has taken early steps by tapping into alumni networks and has broadened its pool of potential employers, including PSUs [public sector undertakings],” said Professor Suhas Joshi, director, IIT Indore.A student at IIT Bombay said, “Companies that till last year picked 5 to 8 students are picking 1 or 2 this year. Several are still not yet hired. From coaching classes to startups, some have recently been picked for salary packages of Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000 in phase two.”Another student from IIT Kharagpur said, “Spectrum Technologies offered Rs 3.6L to trainee engineers and Rs 6 lakh to trainee design engineers. Startoon Labs and Gem Machinery offered Rs 5.5L annually. Skyroot offered Rs 5L. Sri Chaitanya and Next Education offered Rs 4.8-6L per annum, respectively.”“The scenario now is that many students are taking up jobs offering the bare minimum threshold salary of Rs 6L a year but are looking for other jobs,” a source said.There are also those students who are reluctant to accept a low-paying offer. A representative from an IIT said that smaller companies are offering salaries ranging from Rs 5-6L, but students are holding out for better opportunities due to the prestige associated with IITs.A BTech student at IIT Delhi described the 2024 placement season as ""lacklustre"". IIT Delhi placements occur in three phases – the first and second phases are in December and February, and the final phase is in May. At some institutes like IIT Bombay, companies will continue to visit till June/July. <iframe title=""Reality check for IITs"" aria-label=""Grouped Columns"" id=""datawrapper-chart-F1hh6"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/F1hh6/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""600"" data-external=""1""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>Students and placement office staff of the IITs said they are trying to attract more companies, negotiating packages with NGOs, reaching out to job portals, and providing guidance to final-year students.Nany students who haven't been placed yet are applying for positions on LinkedIn, asking batchmates and seniors for referrals or contemplating additional qualifications and preparing for the CAT (Common Admission Test) exam for management programmes.Some students are also looking at joining government organisations or the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) or SSC (State Service Commission), said IIT Kanpur alumnus Dheeraj Singh.Singh, who is the founder of the Global IIT Alumnus Support Group, said, ""Off-campus placement is extremely challenging and many on-campus placed students are not happy with the pay packages offered. The situation is appalling.""Singh looked at placement data from the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and drew up estimates based on an Right to Information or RTI response received from IIT Delhi. IIT Delhi's reply said that 1,035 graduating students were placed till February 28 this year. The reply, however, did not mention the number of students registered for placements. Until December 2023 when the first phase of placements ended, IIT Delhi had disclosed that close to 1,000 students were placed. ""So between January 15 and the end of February, merely 36 students were placed. From this I estimate that the tail end is a pretty long one,"" Singh said.Praveen Tyagi, owner of IITians’ Pace, a tutorial for entrance tests, said, “While AI has reduced jobs and international FAANG [Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet (formerly Google)] companies did not come to the campus, we saw this as an opportunity to pick up talent.

Approximately 30% of students across these IITs are still awaiting placements this season, with a decrease of 15-25% in job offers compared to the previous year.At IIT Delhi, a significant number are still seeking employment through the Office of Career Services (OCS), a body that conducts training and placement activities. As of April 5, out of 1,814 students registered with OCS, 1,083 had secured jobs, leaving approximately 40% of them yet to find employment. At IIT Bombay, 33% of the 1,973 participating students were still seeking jobs as of April 4. The situation is more promising for undergraduate programmes (BTech + dual degree), with 81% of participants securing jobs. The master's and PhD programmes, however, face lower placement rates, affecting the overall hiring percentage. Last year, IIT Bombay reported an overall placement rate of 82%. Meanwhile, IIT Delhi's overall placement percentage stood at around 84%. At the end of this academic year's placement season, the percentage could be lower.Media reports have been highlighting the effects of the tech industry slowdown and the broader decline in hiring on placements across various institutions, including the IITs, since before the commencement of the placement season. ""The slowdown is a global phenomenon. IT hiring has seen a lull around the world,"" said an IIT Bombay source.And the process of placement has become even more rigorous. At IIT Delhi, the placement process lasts for about 15 days. ""We are mentally prepared for a set pattern of questions, but this time the companies were more demanding, seeking fewer candidates -- those with specialised training in artificial intelligence and machine learning for annual packages ranging from Rs 10L to Rs 50L,"" a student said, adding that he lacked the skills because his focus was on software development.The increase in batch sizes at institutes like IIT Delhi has further complicated the placement scenario. OCS at IIT Delhi observed a 20% rise in student participation compared to the previous year.Professor Rajib Maity, head of the placement cell at IIT Kharagpur, mentioned that so far, there are 1,500 students with job offers from over 350 companies, with more offers expected. He said the OCS is strategising dedicated placement drives for PhD students, reflecting the institute's efforts to address the evolving job market challenges.Inputs from Shreya Ghosh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/economy-is-on-strong-footing-then-why-such-low-salaries-for-indias-brightest/articleshow/109504275.cms

According to rules, any person with or without holding any shares in a listed target company, can make an offer to acquire shares of the entity subject to a minimum offer size of 26%. Also, any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least 10% in a listed company can move a resolution to change its directors. Prior to Zee announcing a merger deal with Sony in 2021, the Indian company’s then largest shareholder Invesco had sought a rejig of the board including the ouster of Goenka. Unless Goenka procures funds for Zee’s growth plans, he could face a similar situation with investors teaming up against him. Though the company has cash on its books and carries hardly any debt, its profits have been plunging on weak industry dynamics. “The fallout of the failed merger will compound problems for Zee and it could see institutional investors voicing their concerns for a change. However, the current management would have been cognizant about this and would have already created a contingency plan to tackle this,” said N V Capital managing partner Vivek Menon. The largest institutional shareholders in Zee are ICICI Prudential MF (7%), Nippon India MF (6%), HDFC MF (5%) and LIC (5%). In the past, Tata Group’s former chairman late Cyrus Mistry, ICRA’s ex MD Naresh Takkar, Fortis Healthcare’s then director Brian Tempest and Dish TV’s promoter Jawahar Goel (brother of Subhash Chandra) were ousted by shareholders. Not just pacifying investors, Zee would also have to ward off any takeover attempt. “The Zee-Sony merger would have addressed Zee’s low promoter ownership challenge as post-merger Sony would have owned 51%,” said foreign brokerage CLSA. According to Prime Database, about 80 companies including Infosys, Suzlon Energy and Max Financial Services, had promoter holdings below 15%, as on September 30, 2023. Some like Larsen & Toubro, Zomato, One97 Communications (Paytm) and Delhivery don’t have any promoters.“A low promoter holding may expose a company to a hostile takeover risk, if there is a certain ‘block’ of institutional investors who may want an exit. A mandatory 26% open offer by the acquirer may also seem lucrative to retail investors, especially if a low promoter holding is perceived negatively by the market,” said Katalyst Advisors’ executive director Binoy Parikh. “Although an acquirer gaining significant control might bring focused strategic direction, it’s important to consider mandatory Competition Commission approval, especially if the buyer operates in the same business sector.” India has seen very few unfriendly takeover moves. In 2012, the Goenka family’s Essel Group picked up shares of IVRCL from the open market, reaching a level where its holding surpassed that of the promoters of the infrastructure development company. The founders of IVRCL held 11% in the company at that time. The share-acquisition was seen as a hostile takeover move by Essel. However, Essel later changed its mind from increasing its holding in IVRCL to exiting the entity. In Zee, Essel’s stake fell from 42% in 2019 to 4% as it sold shares to repay loans. Of the 4%, 5% is pledged, BSE data showed. In other words, 0.2% of the total equity of Zee is pledged. Other companies that saw hostile takeover attempts were L&T (by Reliance Industries and Aditya Birla Group), Shapoorji Pallonji-owned Forbes Gokak, Gesco (now part of Mahindra Lifespace Developers), Tatas-controlled Voltas, Nusli Wadia’s Bombay Dyeing and EIH (Oberoi hotels).

To boost private consumption expenditure, it is suggested that this threshold be raised to at least Rs 20 lakhs,” the economist said.Ranen Banerjee, Partner and Leader, Economic Advisory Services Government Sector Leader, PwC India believes that there is clearly a need for providing higher standard deductions. “This will help tax paying households cope with the inflationary increases. This could further incentivise people to move to the new tax regime,” he said.Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers states that the growth in personal income tax has been significant post pandemic and the increase in taxpayer base over the years shows the compliance measures are paying fruit. “As revenue collection growth remains strong owing to the robust economic performance and also higher collections of GST, the government may find space to increase the tax slab levels,” he said.Also Read | Budget 2024: Why standard deduction for salaried taxpayers needs to be hikedHajra adds that the new income tax regime is viewed as disincentivizing savings as those deductions on investments available in the old tax regime do not apply to those who opted for the new tax regime. “In order to incentivize savings and also make the new tax regime attractive, certain savings and payments can be allowed towards deductions,” he told TOI.Yuvika Singhal, Economist at QuantEco Research believes that the government should aim to increase the acceptance of the new income tax regime.

""PWD, Delhi, is an esteemed client and we value the long years of association with them. However, L&T would like to state that a counterclaim of Rs 500 crore has been made against PWD,"" said a company spokesperson.  Major Design Flaws In Pragati Maidan Tunnel Remain Unresolved, Says PWD PWD officials said major flaws in the design of the Pragati tunnel project had come to the fore, which have not been fixed. It said in a notice sent to construction firm L&T that ""serious technical deficiencies"" led to consequent damage and losses to the govt in managing and operating the project. It posed a ""potential threat"" to the life of commuters using the tunnel and underpasses in its current state.Built at a cost of Rs 777 crore, the project was funded by the Centre while Delhi PWD was to execute the project. It, in turn, engaged L&T as an EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor. Preparation of the design, execution and maintenance, and repair work were the sole responsibility of L&T.""The project-related issues mentioned in the present notice have a far-reaching impact not only on public safety but also on the future development and management of vehicular/traffic movement in and around New Delhi and other connecting roads,"" said the notice.Inauguration of the project by PM Narendra Modi lent a ""greater prestige"" to it, said PWD, and it was hailed as being a one of its kind, providing seamless connectivity and facilitating commute around important landmarks, including the international convention centre at Pragati Maidan, Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and India Gate.""To the utter dismay of all concerned...with the passage of time, it revealed glaring infirmities, which were not only technical in nature but were also design flaws,"" the notice read.""The most glaring as well as alarming issue was the accumulation of water across various locations in the tunnel. This issue, especially during the monsoon season, rendered the entire project non-operational for the general public and ultimately ended up causing far more blockages and congestion along the arterial roads of the entire New Delhi area which defeated the very purpose of this ambitious project,"" it added.While the construction work started in November 2017, it took L&T four years and seven months to make the underpasses and main tunnel ready for the public.Officials said L&T had agreed to a specific code of practice for design and construction with the project to have a life of 100 years, but the flaws cannot be resolved without a major revamp and overhaul of the entire project. ""We had never envisaged a situation where defects of such magnitude would surface within a few days of operation and these would have such deleterious effects on the entire project,"" said an official.They added that there were multiple site inspections, and despite assurances, L&T engineers failed to act upon the proposed solutions.Officials pointed out that high-level inspections, led by lieutenant governor V K Saxena, were carried out in Aug and Sep 2022 and more recently on Jan 17 this year, followed by detailed technical reports and action plans for immediate redressal of issues.""The records would reveal that not only has your company failed to take any action towards resolving the issues at hand, but has even failed to provide contractually agreed maintenance services at the project site.... It has become clear that the company is purposely avoiding rectifying the defects and issues...(and is) liable for dereliction of contractual obligations as well as public duties,"" the notice read",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/pwd-notice-to-lt-on-pragati-tunnel-flaws-co-makes-rs-500-crore-counterclaim/articleshow/107441577.cms

It marks the birthplace of Lord Rama, the revered deity and central figure of the Ramayana."," The majestic Ayodhya Ram Mandir, rising amidst the sacred city of Ayodhya, is more than just a temple; it's a cultural and architectural marvel, a testament to India's rich heritage and spiritual ethos. Every facet of this magnificent structure, from its intricate design to its unique construction techniques, reflects the deep devotion and meticulous planning that went into its creation. The Ram Mandir holds immense cultural significance for Hindus worldwide. It marks the birthplace of Lord Rama, the revered deity and central figure of the Ramayana. Culture includes language, practices, festivities, etc. Acting as a pride of India, the Ram Mandir reminds us of these critical cultural aspects of Ramayan, such as compassion and selflessness towards citizens, obedience and respect for elders, protecting the dependents, transcending caste discrimination, taking a courageous stand against injustice, sacrificing to keep the vows, etc. The temple embodies the values of righteousness, devotion, and perseverance, serving as a beacon of hope and inspiration for millions. The Ayodhya Ram Mandir is a unique example of Indian temple architecture, reflecting the principles of Hinduism and the rich cultural heritage of India. The Ayodhya Ram Mandir, a three-story temple, follows the Nagara style of Hindu architecture, which dates back to the fifth century CE Gupta era. Spanning 380x250x161 feet with 392 pillars and 44 doors, it is being constructed with design input from various institutions, including IITs and CBRI. Larsen and Toubro (L&T) handled the construction, while Tata Consulting Engineers Limited (TCEL) managed the project. 107220686The templeâs use of stone, intricate carvings and sculptures, and its prominent shikhara are all significant features of its architecture. The temple is built using pink sandstone, which symbolizes cultural and divine reverence. The templeâs construction techniques are innovative, using a lock and key mechanism instead of cement or lime mortar in joints. The templeâs integration of principles from the Vastu Shastra for spatial harmony and cosmic alignment and the Shilpa Shastra for traditional art and craftsmanship is also noteworthy.Also Read: The importance of Mysore's 'Krishna Shila' stone used in making Ram Lalla idol With the use of only stone and not iron or steel and a 15-meter-deep foundation of specially treated soil, the temple has a life of more than 1000 years. Special bricks with âShri Ramâ inscribed on them have been used in its construction. These bricks, named Ram Shilas, draw a parallel with the stones used in the construction of Ram Setu, thus intertwining modern craftsmanship with ancient symbolism. The templeâs main sanctum sanctorum features the childhood form of Bhagwan Shri Ram (Shri Ram Lalla). The temple also has five mandaps (halls): Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, Sabha Mandap, Prathana Mandap, and Kirtan Mandap. All along the parikrama path, 100 events from Valmikiâs Ramayana have been engraved on the walkways and columns. The idea is to present Ram Katha Darshan. 107220608The Ram Mandir complex is equipped with essential infrastructure, including a sewage treatment plant, a water treatment plant, a fire service, and an independent power station. It features a Pilgrims Facility Center with a capacity of 25,000, offering medical and locker facilities. Additionally, there is a dedicated block with bathing areas and washrooms. To mitigate lightning damage, around 200 KA light arresters have been installed. The complex also houses a museum displaying artifacts related to Lord Ram and the Ramayana, emphasizing its role not only as a religious but also as a cultural and educational center.Also Read:A look at the three Ram Lallas of Ayodhya and what makes each one unique  A time capsule, placed 2,000 feet below the Ram Mandir, contains a copper plate with information about the temple, Lord Rama, and Ayodhya to preserve its identity for the future.

It was constructed by deploying a 3D-printing technology that","BENGALURU: Bengaluru has added one more feather to its cap. The tech capital is now home to a 3D-printed post office, the first of its kind in the country. Located in Cambridge Layout near Ulsoor, the post office was constructed by deploying a 3D-printing technology that built the structure layer by layer using quick-setting materials. A specially created robotic arm extruder was used to do contour crafting and achieve the unique design. Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw inaugurated the post office on Friday. The construction, with a built-up area of 1,021sqft, was completed in 43 days. The conventional construction method takes about 10 months. Describing the post office as ""the spirit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat"", Vaishnaw said: ""This is a technology demonstrator. When this will become mainstream, we will see more such initiatives on taking this tech forward."" The building was constructed by Larsen and Toubro, with technical guidance from IIT Madras, at a cost of Rs 23 lakh. Though the project was supposed to be completed by September last year it was extended to May, 2023. S Rajendra Kumar, chief post master general of Bengaluru, explained the reason behind the lag between project clearance and completion of construction: ""When we got the project clearance in August 2022, Larsen & Toubro Ltd was already submitting designs for it. By the time we got the approvals, sourced materials and demonstrated tech, it took us several months. The moment we figured out everything, we started construction of the post office. We completed it in a span of 43 days.""While construction was completed in the first week of May, the inauguration was delayed by a few months to create drainage and water networks. ""Lucky for us, the G20 meet happened in Bengaluru today (Friday) and we could kickstart it,"" Kumar explained. Vaishnaw said that in future 3D-printing technology will be deployed in various other sectors such as housing. ""Nobody thought that India would be developing its own 4G and 5G technology. Nobody ever imagined that India would emerge as a developer and manufacturer of telecom technology. Nobody ever thought that the country would be able to design and manufacture a world-class train,"" he added.Protest post inauguration A group of Congress workers protested after the inauguration of the post office. Reason: MLA of the constituency where the post office was opened, NA Haris, was not invited. Not mentioning the name of Shantinagar MLA in the invitation was seen as a sign of disrespect towards him, the group said.

Over 4,400 runners participated in the event, making history. Find out more about the venue, route, and participants' experiences.","Well before daybreak Sunday, around 4,400 runners stepped on to the Atal Setu or Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), India's newest and longest sea bridge, and made history as they participated in the inaugural L&T Sea Bridge Marathon that was held in association with The Times of India and MMRDA.A cool sea breeze greeted them at the starting point of Atal Setu at Sewri. The beam of the streetlights gradually gave way to a scarlet sky as the sun rose over the horizon, offering a stunning view to remember.It was less than a month since the last marathon was held in Mumbai on Jan 21, yet similar excitement reverberated among participants. The full 42.2k marathon that started at 5am had 131 runners, including 10 women. The maximum runners were in the 10k category with 1,109 men and 493 women, while the half marathon saw 1,029 participants, including 167 women.List of VIP participants in the marathonParth JindalMD and CEO of Jindal Paint and Cement, JSW SteelAdil NagrolwalaCorporate SVP HR - Head Talent Acquisition at WNS Global ServicesKrishna Prakash, IPSAdditional Director General of One Force, MaharashtraVishwas Nangare Patil, IPSAdditional Director General of Police in the Anti-corruption Bureau, MaharashtraAlok AgarwalChief Financial Officer of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL)Vishvas MoteAssistant Commissioner, Municipal Corporation Of Greater MumbaiShibani GharatAssociate Executive Producer and anchor, CNBC-TV18Laxmi JhaFitness InfluencerDevneet BajajManaging Director, Dream Capital & Chief Strategy Officer, Dream SportsPriyanka RunwalRunwal BuildersSanjiv MantriMD & CEO at ICICI LombardSheran MehraChief Brand Officer and Business Head - Hotels, Tata DigitalMadhura SekhsariaHead- Partnerships, Tata nexarcRetd.

The full marathoners said the route, though great, was not all flat - there were gentle slopes and undulations.Given the nature of the route, runners felt the absence of shade from trees, spectators cheering from the sidelines, and volunteers offering energy bars and fruit slices as they do during other marathons mid-city.Anil Verma, who ran the full 42k, said, ""I signed up because I wanted to be among the first runners to cross the finish line on Atal Setu and make my family proud. The event was wonderfully organised at short notice."" He had come expecting a perfect route for running, but it wasn't without challenges. ""It was rolling. Just like life, there were some ups and downs,"" Verma said.Half marathoner Jiger Saiya and Kishore Patil appreciated the holding area and race management but suggested more toilets and litter bins, advanced start time for half and 10k and ""more importantly, more music"" along the route to motivate runners when their energy ebbs.Corporate heads and film stars arrived to salute the spirit of the participants. Among those who flagged off the various race categories were S N Subrahmanyan, chairman and managing director of Larsen & Toubro, its CFO R Shankar Raman, state industries minister Uday Samant, Meena Subrahmanyan, president, Prayas Trust, L&T, as well as Pradeep Yadav, chief, urban design, MMRDA and IAS officer Radhabinod Sharma, apart from actors Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff. Parth Jindal, MD and CEO of Jindal Paint and Cement, also did the 10km run.Along with L&T, associate partner MMRDA, race director P Venkatraman of YouTooCanRun, and JICA, the financial partner, went the extra mile to make the morning memorable. ""I liked that the organisers took no chances with the health status of participants,'"" said Dr Sangeeta Makkad (62) who ran the half marathon.Indeed, Venkatraman told TOI, ""For the first time in an Indian marathon, we compulsorily sought health details during registration to red flag those who needed medical advice before running. While some needed treatments for minor complaints like cramps, one runner was hospitalised."" Amay Vansare suffered from tachycardia (fast heartbeat) and was taken to hospital by ambulance where he was kept under observation while his family was informed. Venkatraman said, ""He will mostly be discharged on Monday.""Sumeet Chatterjee, chief of corpcomm, L&T, called the run ""a triumph of the human spirit"".Centuries ago, the first causeway, Hornby's Vellard completed in 1784, was one of the first major engineering projects that formed a crucial connection between north and south Bombay. It aimed to transform the original seven islands of Bombay into a single island with a deep natural harbour.

Construction of the operation and control centre is also at an advanced stage.MMRDA said it has completed 50% work on the toll infrastructure.MTHL is a 22km-long sea bridge with a 16.5km sea portion and 5.5km of land, thus connecting the island city to the mainland.When completed, the sea bridge would be the longest in India and cater to 70,000 vehicles daily.Around 14,000 people were employed when work was at its peak for this project that required skilled workers at all stages of construction.Building of the Sewri side of the bridge as well as the land work went to a consortium of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and Japan's IHI Infrastructure Systems. The Navi Mumbai side of the bridge was assigned to Daewoo-Tata. Work on the ground began in April 2018.Meanwhile, the project cost escalated from Rs 4,500 crore in 2005 to Rs 17,843 crore in 2018, about 85% of which was funded by a loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/96-work-on-trans-harbour-link-complete-ahead-of-december-deadline/articleshow/104793343.cms

During the day, it gyrated between a high of 72,151.02 and a low of 71,574.89.The Nifty dipped 28.25 points or 0.13 per cent to 21,697.45. It oscillated between the day's high of 21,832.95 and a low of 21,658.75.Market sentiments were also dampened after the US Federal Reserve indicated it likely won't cut interest rates in March.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday hiked capital expenditure by 11 per cent for the next fiscal to sustain world-beating economic growth rate while trimming the deficit in a reform-oriented interim Budget that also gave relief to common man from disputed small tax demands of up to Rs 25,000.Presenting a vote on account or an interim Budget for 2024-25, Sitharaman proposed no changes in income tax rates for individuals and corporates, as well as customs duty.In less than an hour-long budget speech, she presented the Modi government's achievements in the last 10 years that transformed India from being a 'fragile' economy to the world's fastest-growing major economy.She hiked capital expenditure to Rs 11.11 lakh crore for 2024-25 while trimming the fiscal deficit for this financial year to 5.8 per cent, from the budgeted 5.9 per cent of GDP, and further lowering to 5.1 per cent in the next fiscal.""The domestic market was marginally disappointed by lower-than-expected infra spending in the interim Budget. However, the government's commitment to fiscal prudence, targeting a fiscal deficit of 5.1% for FY25, is expected to improve the outlook on economic ratings,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.Meanwhile, the US FED's decision to maintain rates without clear guidance on future cuts dampened market sentiments, he added.""Equity indices lost all their early gains during the presentation of the interim Budget today to end in the red.

The Budget is largely non-populist, given that there is barely any change in Budgeted subsidies for FY25, uncharacteristic of an interim Budget ahead of the national elections.""The policy intent was crystal clear as seen through the selective allocation of resources, with stronger emphasis on sectors of rural and middle-class housing and Green Energy,"" said Amar Ambani, Executive Director, YES Securities.Clearly, the biggest plus for the market was the aggressive fiscal deficit target of 5.1 per cent for FY25 versus the expectation of 5.5 per cent, he added.Goods and Services Tax collections jumped 10.4 per cent to over Rs 1.72 lakh crore in January, reflecting buoyant economic activity and setting the stage for the next phase of GST reforms.In Asian markets, Seoul and Hong Kong settled in the green while Tokyo and Shanghai ended lower.European markets were trading on a mixed note.

However, its full potential will be realized upon the completion of additional projects, including the Sewri-Worli elevated corridor, the Eastern Freeway-Marine Drive tunnel, the proposed Chirle-Palaspe connection linking with the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, and the international airport in Navi Mumbai.Here are the 10 important aspects of MTHL: Pathway to the Navi Mumbai international airport: Under construction since 2018, the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) will offer a more direct pathway to the Navi Mumbai international airport, serving as the crucial second airport in the area following the completion of the Navi Mumbai Coastal Road.Increase in Pune-bound traffic: The traffic to Pune too is expected to take a massive jump once the shortcut to the Expressway is built from the MTHL at the Chirle end across the harbour. At present, the distance from Chirle to Palasphe Phata, from where the Expressway starts, is 15km, a travel time of almost 25 minutes. The 6.5-km-long elevated route between Chirle and Palaspe will help cut down travel time to a mere five minutes.106694415Also for freight and bus operators: The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) stated that in addition to accommodating passenger cars, the MTHL was also meant for freight and bus operators.Toll at Rs 250: For the initial year, the toll for a one-way passage on MTHL is set at Rs 250, while the round-trip toll is Rs 375.No toll queues: MTHL will have an open road tolling (ORT) system, which eliminates the need for boom barriers, eradicating the long queues typically observed at toll booths. The ORT system, already at work in Singapore, doesn’t require vehicles to halt for toll payment. Instead, advanced scanners and cameras identify moving vehicles and electronically collect toll. The advantages are numerous: enhanced commuter experience, fuel efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness.See-through crash barrier: MTHL’s crash barrier has been kept at a height of 1.55 metre to ensure that views of the sea from car seats are not blocked. The barrier comprises a concrete section, of 90cm height, and a metal rail above it, with a gap between the two. MMRDA had originally planned a solid wall, but shelved it as that would have created a disconcerting tunnel effect along MTHL’s entirety.Dynamic displays: Motorists will have real-time information through dynamic displays, which includes messages for traffic congestion and alerts in case of accidents or emergencies.Special recyclable road surface offers smooth ride: MTHL took more than 14,000 skilled workers to put together and had over 5,000 workers toiling on it at any given time. Larsen & Toubro, Tata Projects, Japan’s IHI Corporation, Daewoo Engineering and Strabarg Infrastructure of Austria were the companies that executed the project incorporating many technological features. The bridge is paved with stone matrix asphalt, which has a high percentage of crushed, durable stone aggregates and a specialised asphalt binder. SMA roads promise 20-30% increase in pavement life and high resistance to variation in temperature. It also demonstrates better adhesion between aggregate and bitumen, reduces traffic noise, improves wet-weather skid resistance and enhances pavement marking visibility. Motorists can expect a pothole-free ride, irrespective of weather conditions. What’s more, SMA pavements will be 100% recyclable at the end of their service life.Surveillance and detection systems: A network of hi-definition cameras has been placed to monitor traffic and also facilitate emergency response. In addition, there is a video incident detection system (to identify stalled vehicles, unauthorised pedestrian movement, wrong-side driving, fires and obstacles) and a speed violation detection system (for penalising motorists who exceed MTHL’s 100kmph speed limit).Special light poles: Environmentalists were concerned that lighting on MTHL would disturb marine life at night. But engineers have solved the problem by installing 1,212 special light poles that will illuminate only the carriageway without any luminous spill onto the sea.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-trans-harbour-link-opening-10-key-highlights-you-need-to-know/articleshow/106723640.cms

Prestige Estates Projects Ltd. surged about 140%, while DLF Ltd. almost doubled. “A combination of a strong pent-up demand for housing, above average affordability and 12-year low unsold inventory should drive a multi-year virtuous housing cycle,” according to a Jefferies note this month. InfrastructureEngineering behemoth Larsen & Toubro Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd ranked among the top performers on the benchmark gauge, underscoring the focus on building infrastructure in the world’s most-populous nation. “Cement is a good way to play real estate and infrastructure sectors in India and it can do well in 2024,” said Arun Malhotra, a fund manager with CapGrow Capital Advisors LLP. “We have seen real estate activity remaining firm and companies getting strong bookings for projects.”State-owned firms had their best year since 2009 as the government ramped up spending.

The project to develop these light tanks was approved last year, with Larsen and Toubro collaborating with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to create a prototype.However, according to the report the project faced obstacles when a German firm, selected for engine supply due to its high power-to-weight ratio, failed to reach an agreement. Despite months of negotiations, the German company could not commit to delivering the engines on time, even after diplomatic intervention, defence insiders said. This delay hindered the progress of the light tank development. As a result, the decision was made to engage with American companies, and Cummins' offer was accepted.The Indian Army has estimated that it requires 354 light tanks in the high altitude areas of Ladakh. Out of these, L&T-DRDO will manufacture 59 tanks, while the remaining tanks will be produced by other Indian companies after a bidding process. The development plan for the Indian light tank is named Project Zorawar. This tank will incorporate modern features such as artificial intelligence integration, drone warfare capabilities, and active protection systems. 100972220The L&T-DRDO option is based on the chassis of the K9 Vajra self-propelled artillery, which is currently in service and manufactured in India for the Army. The light tanks must be able to operate effectively in various terrains, including high altitude areas and island territories. Additionally, they need to be air-transportable for rapid deployment. Officials have emphasized the importance of a lightweight and agile platform with substantial firepower, protection, surveillance, and communication capabilities.The need for a light tank arose two years ago when China deployed a significant number of troops and heavy equipment to disputed areas in eastern Ladakh. China's introduction of new type 15 light tanks along the Line of Actual Control in April 2020 temporarily gave them an advantage. In response, the Indian Army deployed several T-72 and T-90 tanks, which were heavier and designed for operations in plains and deserts. While these deployments had a deterrence impact, they faced limitations in high altitude areas.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/countering-china-india-chooses-us-firm-cummins-for-engines-of-indigenous-light-tank-engines-for-indian-army/articleshow/104427160.cms

The royal couple recently invited the 57-year-old engineer to attend a garden party at Buckingham Palace. Born and raised in Ahmedabad, Jain’s educational journey saw him complete his schooling in the city before pursuing an engineering degree from BVM Engineering College in Vallabh Vidyanagar. He obtained an MBA from Surat, solidifying his expertise in the field.100561304 Jain told TOI that he started his professional career with Ahmedabad Electricity Company, today known as Torrent Power, in Sabarmati. Over the years, he ventured into diverse roles, including stints at Batliboi & Co and a notable 17-year tenure at Larsen & Toubro Ltd. Fascinatingly, a significant portion of his tenure with Larsen & Toubro was spent in the United Kingdom and other European countries, igniting his global perspective. Building upon his vast experience, Jain ventured into entrepreneurship, establishing his own successful consultancy business in the UK, where he has resided with his wife and daughter for the past 23 years. Currently, Jain organizes workshops on emotional intelligence and spirituality in business for leading corporations across the US, the UK, Middle East countries, and India. Additionally, he has made valuable contributions as a board member of the Jain International Trade Organisation (JITO) in the UK.Jain’s dedication to philanthropy and community welfare bloomed during his tenure as a trustee at Jain Vishwa Bharati London (JVB), where he commenced his volunteering journey in 2012. The Coronation Champion awards, organized by the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS), were devised by Queen Consort Camilla to celebrate the UK’s army of volunteers. The royal couple used the coronation to recognize and reward those who go the extra mile in their communities. Jain credits his achievements to the values instilled in him by his parents, Sagarmal Jain and Rajkumari Jain, who laid the foundation for his success early in his life.Committed to empowering the younger generation, Jain worked to educate and upskill approximately 1,000 children, offering invaluable access to free education for those in need.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/nrg-philanthropists-service-recognized-by-uk-royals/articleshow/100561306.cms

Companies like Larsen & Toubro (L&T), Jindal, and Nagarjuna Company received the contract for this project. The installation of over 900 km pipelines has been completed but roughly 30% of the roads excavated have not been restored.Tharpakhana resident Ashish Pathak said, “Pipes have been laid throughout the capital. But the shoddy restoration of roads has inadvertently caused additional difficulties for locals, particularly during the rainy season. Roads have become narrow.""Ranjan Jha of Khelgaon said, “Pipeline laying work went on between Khelgaon Baba Chowk and Hotwar Jail for four months. For this, the previously constructed black road was excavated but not relaid properly, leaving dug-up earth everywhere. It leads to skidding of vehicles during rain.”Meanwhile, a JUIDCO official said, ""Almost 90% of the work of two companies have been done and restoration has also been completed. However, the third firm began work late May. Hence, some work is outstanding. ”Additional administrator of Ranchi Municipal Corporation, Kunwar Singh Pahan, said, “People can file complaints via company's helpline numbers — 06512200025 and 9431104442.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/juidcos-pipeline-project-worsens-commuters-woes/articleshow/102556158.cms

The first was the redevelopment of Central Vista avenue stretching from Vijay Chowk to India Gate. The stretch which was earlier known as Rajpath has been renamed Kartavya Path.The plan for the redevelopment of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- includes the new Parliament building that was inaugurated on Sunday. The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) under the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has been executing projects under the redevelopment plan.The tender to construct the new Parliament building was awarded to Tata Projects in September 2020 at an estimated cost of Rs 861 crore. Later, the cost rose marginally due to certain changes.Infrastructure firm Larsen & Toubro Limited is constructing the Executive Enclave housing the PMO, cabinet secretariat, India House and the National Security Council Secretariat at an estimated cost of Rs 1,189 crore. The company was awarded the tender in November last year and the project is slated to be completed in 24 months.The Executive Enclave will come up on the south side of the South Block. India House will be used as a conference facility like the Hyderabad House where high-level talks, especially with top visiting leaders of various countries, are currently held.Larsen & Toubro is also constructing the first three buildings of the Common Central Secretariat. It won the bid in October 2021 by quoting Rs 3,142 crore. The CPWD has set a deadline of two-and-half years for the completion of these buildings.Under the Common Central Secretariat, the government plans to construct 10 buildings that will house ministries and other offices. According to the housing ministry, Rs 1,000 crore is annually spent on rent for various government offices and Common Central Secretariat will save the amount.Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan and Rail Bhawan are among other buildings that are likely to be demolished to build the Common Central Secretariat.Under the Central Vista redevelopment project, the North and South blocks, which symbolise the government authority since their inception in Lutyens' Delhi, will be converted into national museums. The North and South Blocks are likely to reflect the history of India and its struggle for Independence.The government also plans to build MPs' chambers that will come up on the land where the Transport Bhawan and Shram Shakti Bhawan are located.The government will also set up a large 'Defence Enclave' to house the personnel and top brass of the defence establishment. The vice president's house and its nearby buildings will be demolished to pave the way for constructing the enclave.The new building of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) will be constructed beside the National Archives of India by June 2024. The Central Conference Centre is slated to be built by December 2026.

""It will take us over a month to finalise the bidders. The period for construction of the twin tunnels is estimated to be around four years as it involves complex works,"" said the official. The BMC had aimed to start work from March 2023 onwards, however, it got delayed owing to extensions given to the tender.It was in October 2022, that the BMC had floated tenders for construction of twin tunnels to go below Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) with a box tunnel in Film City, Goregaon. While the length of the twin tunnels is proposed to be 4.70km each, the cost of construction is estimated to be Rs 6,322 crore. The entire cost of the project is approximately Rs 8,000 crore.Owing to the tunnel on the Nahur side of the project, about 711 structures are to be affected, of which about 51 structures are commercial. The said plot belongs to the state government. In addition, the forest department had earlier asked the BMC to accommodate about 100 PAPs in national park area in keeping with the conditions imposed for wildlife NOC.It is very likely that the tunneling works for the project will be done using the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) technology that is also being used for tunnelling of other ongoing underground projects in the city, such as Metro-3 corridor and Mumbai Coastal Road project.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/thrice-unlucky-finally-three-bidders-for-gmlr-project/articleshow/101621782.cms

With the Joka–Taratala segment having been inaugurated on December 30, 2022, and the Majherhat Metro station nearing completion, the construction work for the Majerhat to Esplanade section of the Purple Line is now in full swing. The Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), the executing agency for this project, has set an aggressive target of completing this phase within the next 48 months. Once this section is operational, commuting from the southwestern parts of Kolkata, including Taratala, Behala, Thakurpukur, and Joka, to Central Kolkata will become significantly smoother and more convenient.One of the most exciting developments within this expansion is the construction of the underground Victoria Metro station, situated adjacent to the iconic Victoria Memorial Hall, a beloved landmark in the ""City of Joy."" Victoria Station is slated to be one of the four underground stations on the Purple Line. Upon its completion, residents from various parts of the city will have easy access to this iconic monument. Furthermore, the station will provide convenient access to two other renowned structures, the M.P. Birla Planetarium, known as Taramandal, and St. Paul's Cathedral. Additionally, it will serve as an alternative gateway to several cultural landmarks, including Rabindra Sadan, Nandan, the Academy of Fine Arts, Nehru Children’s Museum, and the prestigious PG Hospital (IPGMER & SSKM Hospital). Furthermore, residents from across the city and its suburbs will be able to visit the Brigade Parade Ground, fondly known as 'Garer Maath,' and enjoy leisurely afternoons and evenings in the serene surroundings, said Metro Rail Chief Public Relations Officer Kausik Mitra The recent launch of construction activities for Victoria Station by RVNL marks a significant step forward. RVNL has commenced barricading approximately 5,000 square meters of space for the underground station's construction. To facilitate this, the iconic Fountain of Joy at Kolkata Maidan will be temporarily dismantled and later restored upon project completion. Additionally, several trees will be carefully transplanted to accommodate the construction. Presently, RVNL engineers are in the initial stages of mobilization, with around 30 weeks of preparatory work anticipated before the construction phase begins in earnest. Victoria station will be constructed using the Cut and Cover method, and M/s Larsen and Toubro Ltd. will be involved in its development. The station will feature a 325-meter-long diaphragm wall upon completion.In an effort to assess the potential vibration levels during both construction and operation, a Vibration Impact Study has been conducted for the Metro Railway. Following the study's findings, the project has received a No Objection Certificate from the Victoria Memorial Hall Authority.Moreover, measures are being implemented to mitigate air and noise pollution, particularly in the Maidan area, during the station's construction. These measures aim to ensure the preservation of the aesthetic appeal of Victoria and its surroundings throughout the project's duration.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/construction-commences-for-victoria-metro-station-in-kolkatas-purple-line-expansion/articleshow/103734786.cms

Since the stretch between Chitranagari (Film City) to Khindipada Junction is part of the Sanjay Gandhi National Sanctuary, the BMC undertook a detailed study to add this stretch (missing link). Following the study it was decided to connect this phase through twin parallel and completely underground tunnels.The GMLR is proposed for west and east link to reduce traffic congestion.

The sensex had surged 474.46 points or 0.71 per cent to settle at its fresh all-time closing high of 67,571.90 on Thursday.One of the main reasons behind Friday's fall was the downward revision of guidance by IT major Infosys.

Following the release of its first-quarter numbers, Hindustan Unilever also witnessed a notable downturn. Hindustan Unilever lost 3.67% after failing to meet the June-quarter profit expectations due to higher costs.Additionally, index heavyweight Reliance Industries declined by 3.10% ahead of its June quarter results, which were scheduled to be released post-market hours on Friday.On the positive sign, Larsen & Toubro performed well, gaining 3.88% and reaching a fresh record high after securing a construction order worth 70 billion rupees. The company also planned to consider a proposal for the buyback of equity shares and payment of special dividends. Additionally, Union Bank of India saw a significant jump of nearly 4%, consequently pulling public sector banks up by 0.25%, following the announcement of higher June-quarter profit.The record-breaking rally of past few days had helped sensex surged more than 10,000 points from the year’s low of 57,527 seen on March 24.Strong buying by foreign funds, good progress of the monsoon, a stable currency, the RBI’s proactive measures that have been successfully keeping a check on inflation, have all combined to take the indices to new highs on a regular basis, market players said.Along with India, other equities in Asia declined too, following weakness in Wall Street overnight, as lacklustre earnings from Tesla and Netflix and concerns of a prolonged high-interest rate regime in the US weighed on sentiment.

In contrast, the US-based investment bank has cut its rating on Chinese stocks to ""equal weight"" According to a note released on Wednesday, India has now climbed to the top spot as the most-preferred market among emerging markets (EMs), rising from the sixth position. This rise is attributed to factors such as supportive foreign inflows, macro stability, and a positive earnings outlook.Morgan Stanley analysts expressed their belief in a consistent trend of sustained superior earnings per share (EPS) growth in India compared to other emerging markets over the economic cycle. They also noted that the country's young demographic profile is contributing to increased equity inflows.Regarding specific sectors, the brokerage remains overweight on financials, consumer discretionary, and industrial segments in India. Furthermore, they assigned an ""add"" rating to Larsen & Toubro and Maruti Suzuki India on their Asia Pacific focus and Global Emerging Markets lists.The situation in Indian markets is in stark contrast to that of China, where the country appears to be at the beginning of a long-wave boom while China may be reaching the end of one. Based on this assessment, the analysts believe it is appropriate to upgrade India to an ""overweight"" rating and downgrade China to ""equal weight,"" given India's outperformance and the potential for a structural shift in favor of India.In the past few days, Chinese assets have experienced a boost, thanks to several promises made by Beijing to stimulate economic growth and revitalize the struggling private sector. However, analysts at the bank caution that these measures are likely to be gradual and may not be sufficient to sustain the gains in the stock market.The report highlights that market sentiment is now refocusing on the structural challenges faced by the country, such as issues with local governments and unemployment, which still lack concrete solutions.The July politburo meeting is seen as conveying more dovish signals, indicating a clear stance on stabilizing economic growth and supporting the private sector. Despite this, the analysts, including Laura Wang and Fran Chen, believe that investor confidence remains fragile, and there is still a hesitancy to pre-position in a significant manner. This reluctance stems from previous disappointment with the relatively lackluster and lukewarm easing measures observed since March.In addition, Morgan Stanley has downgraded Taiwan to ""equal weight,"" citing stretched valuations as technology stocks experience a surge.The report acknowledges that it is challenging to pinpoint the exact top in a market fueled by AI-themed investments and retail investor activity. However, the analysts believe that a considerable amount has already been factored into the market's current pricing, leading them to adopt a more cautious approach and move to the sidelines.

After meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York last,"It's official Elon Musk plans to launch Starlink internet satellite service in India. After meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York last week, Tesla CEO said that he was keen to launch Starlink in India that ""can be incredibly helpful"" in bringing the internet to remote villages that lack on-ground infrastructure.While this may sound welcoming and good, his plans may put him at odds with Mukesh Ambani's Reliance. Reason being that Musk's Starlink wants India to just assign a licence for the service and not insist on auctioning the signal-carrying spectrum or airwaves. This stand of Musk is the same as that of the Tatas, Sunil Bharti Mittal's OneWeb, and Amazon, who too prefer the same route. However, Ambani's Reliance has not been in the favour of auction of spectrum for foreign satellite service providers to offer voice and data services to provide a level playing field to traditional telecom players who offer the same services using airwaves bought in government auctions.Bharti Airtel believes auctioning SS spectrum will create barriers for competition as some may block access by winning the spectrum in spite of having no global allocation.CLSA’s note and DoT licences""India's space-based communication services (SS) spectrum decision is key. Mobile spectrum has been auctioned since 2010 with the government's cumulative sale of USD 77 billion and several players are keen on SS,"" brokerage CLSA said in a note on 'Satellite Spectrum Battle Ahead'.According to the note, several players, including Starlink, are keen on the India satellite spectrum. Amazon's Kuiper, Tata, Bharti Airtel-backed OneWeb, and Larsen & Toubro are against the auction. Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea support an India satellite spectrum auction.The Department of Telecom has granted licences to Oneweb India and Jio Satellite Comm (in partnership with SES) but final SS policies are awaited. ""A key decision for SS will be what method should be used to assign spectrum for user links (L-band & S-band): auction or administrative. This includes higher bands (C, Ku & Ka) and if this will be at national or circle level (like mobile),"" it said.(With agency inputs)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/satellite-internet-how-it-may-have-become-elon-musk-tata-and-amazon-vs-reliance/articleshow/101265695.cms

The SSLV, which has had two development flights, seeks to provide on-demand services to put satellites weighing up to 500 kg in a low-earth orbit. ""We have built our own SSLV which will be transferred to the industry and produced in large numbers to meet the growing demand,"" Isro chairman S Somanath said at the inauguration ceremony of the India Space Congress organised by SIA India. The space agency has decided to opt for the bidding route to transfer the mini-rocket to the industry, a senior official said. The SSLV is the sixth launch vehicle developed by Isro and has undergone two development flights in August last year and in February this year. The maiden flight of the SSLV in August last year was a failure due to vibration disturbance for a short duration on the Equipment Bay deck during the second-stage separation. The Isro took corrective actions after conducting an in-depth analysis of the fault and carried out a successful launch of the SSLV in February. The SSLV injected the Isro's EOS-07 satellite, US-based firm Antaris' Janus-1 and Chennai-based space start-up Space Kidz's AzaadiSAT-2 satellites into a 450-km circular orbit. Small rockets, such as the SSLV, target nano and micro-satellites, which weigh less than 10 kg and 100 kg respectively, offer on-demand launch services, without requiring clients to wait for larger rockets to carry them as co-passengers. Last year, the Isro had awarded a contract to build five polar satellite launch vehicles (PSLVs), its warhorse rocket with 54 successful launches, to a consortium of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Larsen and Toubro. A recent report prepared by the Indian Space Association and consultancy firm EY India said commercial satellite launch services can see India's domestic space industry contribute USD 13 billion to the economy by 2025. The SSLV was the sixth launch vehicle developed by the Isro after the Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3), Advanced Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV), Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) and Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM-3).

During a visit to the under-construction site on Sunday, TOI found that temple Trust has added several new elements within the complex to offer a complete experience to the pilgrims around the Ramayana theme.Followers of Lord Rama will get to see the entire Ramayana inscribed on the walls of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya while doing the parikrama. The first sandstone tile on the parapet wall outside the temple building will have the Putrakameshti Yagna carvings (special prayers offered in the Hindu religion for the sake of bearing children), which is the first episode of the epic when Dasharatha looked up to the sages to start his family. The last tile will have the last episode of the Ramayana - Lord Rama's homecoming after his victory over Lanka.The remaining tiles on the way around the temple complex will showcase the remaining important episodes from the epic. Team TOI on a visit to the Ram Mandir site on Sunday found out that the construction work is going on the schedule and work on setting up temple structures for important characters and senior sages from the Ramayana is under way. The temple Trust is also going to take steps to protect the devotees from the extreme weather conditions. Discussions are on to finalise the kind of stones to be used on the path to the temple complex that the barefoot pilgrims will take. “The red sandstone being used for the construction of the temple has the tendency to absorb heat. We are looking at other options to offer a comfortable experience to the visitors and devotees. Otherwise canopy will be put up on the parikrama route to protect the pilgrims from extreme temperatures, showers and other disturbances,” said Vinod Mehta, the chief project manager of Larsen and Toubro, the company executing the temple work. The temple has been designed in a way to allow maximum ventilation and sunlight as up to 12 doors or entering space have been provided under the mandaps which are going to house the idols of the important characters from the Ramayana. Makrana white marbles are going to be put on the floor within the temple complex while the main 'garbh griha' will have floor and pillars as well as walls and ceiling carved out of white marbles or painted in white. Out of the more than 4.5 lakh cubic feet of sandstone, 1.7 lakh cubic feet had been used by Sunday. At present, the work on the ground floor is on and the slabs have to be set up.

Similarly, Persistent is poised to onboard nearly 800 freshers by December.In a recent earnings call, Coforge's management revealed that out of the 1,000 individuals incorporated during the initial quarter, 200 were graduate engineer trainees. Despite encountering delays in deal closures, the company remains steadfast in its projection of a 13-16% annual revenue growth in constant currency terms.Notably, Coforge's performance in the US exhibited robust growth of about 5.6% in the last quarter, despite the less favorable economic backdrop. Coforge's CEO, Sudhir Singh told ET that given the expansive scope of the US tech services market relative to the company's size, significant opportunities are still there.To accommodate the substantial projects they have secured, Coforge has strategically built a robust bench strength of employees.Persistent's figures for the April-June quarter were in line with expectations, driven by significant expansion within its prime client base and marquee deals. The company's workforce saw an increase of 241 individuals, reaching a total of 23,130. Attrition rates reduced considerably to 15.5% from the previous quarter's 19.8%.Sandeep Kalra, CEO of Persistent Systems, affirmed the company's commitment to a steady influx of freshers, with approximately 800 slated to join between August and December. Kalra emphasized that freshers will be seamlessly integrated, alongside optimization of existing talent.Kalra remains optimistic, asserting that despite prevailing uncertainties, companies are poised for a resurgence within the next two to three quarters.Amidst this backdrop, midcap IT companies are steadfastly maintaining their recruitment pace, including augmentations through mergers and acquisitions. Although they are not achieving record-breaking recruitment numbers, they are concurrently exploring avenues for cost optimization.Larsen and Toubro Technology Services (LTTS) reported an upswing of 318 individuals in their Q1 headcount, reaching 23,392. Attrition rates reduced to 18.9% from the prior quarter's 22.2%.LTTS anticipates welcoming around 750 new employees in the ongoing second quarter. Amit Chadha, CEO of LTTS, affirmed the company's commitment to honoring their recruitment offers.Joseph Anantharaju, Executive Vice Chairman of Happiest Minds, outlined a phased approach to onboarding freshers this quarter, ensuring agility to align with market conditions.Happiest Minds plans to recruit approximately 450 freshers this year, with the remaining additions consisting of laterals and inclusions stemming from mergers and acquisitions.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/midcap-it-companies-like-persistent-ltts-happiest-minds-eye-staff-addition-set-to-keep-hiring-momentum-going/articleshow/102936137.cms

The upcoming stadium, equipped with cutting-edge facilities, will cater to the needs of not only Uttar Pradesh, but also of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh.The stadium will be operated by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Under a long-term lease agreement, the BCCI will assume responsibility for the stadium’s operation and management. The board will also contribute a fixed annual amount to the government in exchange for the lease.Additional chief secretary (Sports and Youth Welfare), Navneet Sehgal on Monday said, “ UP is full of talented cricketers. Renowned players such as Suresh Raina, Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, fast bowler Praveen Kumar and amazing batsman as well as fielder Mohammad Kaif are all from Uttar Pradesh. State’s cricketers are doing well in IPL and other league matches. The stadium will help in honing the skills of these players along with other talented cricketers. The stadium will be yet another step to realise Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s vision of establishing Uttar Pradesh as a powerhouse in sports, commensurate with its population.”According to the officials, approximately Rs 350 crore will be spent in the construction of this stadium, which is being built on a wide campus of about 31 acres. The stadium will have a seating capacity of 30,000 spectators. The upcoming cricket stadium is set to become an outstanding centre for nurturing the skills of young players not only from Purvanchal but also from neighbouring regions, including Bihar, Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh.The proposal for a world class cricket stadium in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has already been there for some time. However, the project could not get off the ground in the absence of suitable land for its construction. The entire process gained momentum in September 2022 when the cabinet approved a budget of Rs 120 crore for the acquisition of the necessary land. The land was purchased from approximately 31 farmers.The land has been handed over to the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) by the government.

It is likely to be awarded the contract after financiers of the project submit their final evaluation in favour of the construction major, railway officials said.In July, last year, Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL), floated tenders valued at Rs 2571.3 crore for the 5.1 km underground section between Mominpore and Esplanade. RVNL hadn’t mentioned any timeline while inviting the tender. Technical bids were opened in February to reveal three bidders — L&T, Afcons and ITD. Sources said L&T’s bid for Rs 2,447 crore was 4.8% below RVNL’s estimate. The results came through on Friday.The twin tunnels will pass through the Maidan area, which belongs to the Army. Though the project was announced around 12 years ago, permission from the defence ministry came only on February 4 last year, when the counsel for the Army informed Calcutta HC that it was agreeable.“The lowest bidder will be entrusted with design and construction of the ramp from the elevated Mominpore station and underground railway works,” said an official. The contract will include construction of four underground stations — Kidderpore, Victoria, Park Street and Esplanade — and digging of tunnels, architectural finishing work and laying of tracks, he said. Underground construction of the city’s Purple line, as the 14km Joka-Esplanade corridor is called, is finally taking off. A 6.4km elevated section from Joka to Taratala has been operational since January.Another 2km extension from Taratala to Majerhat is due this October. “The construction will consist of twin tunnels running through four underground stations. Following the final nod after evaluation by financers, which will come within the next three weeks, L&T will be required to deploy two new tunnel boring machines (TBMs) with one TBM on stand-by,” the official said. On May 27, RVNL floated tenders for construction of a new Maidan Market because the existing one in the Esplanade area will have to be razed to make way for the terminal station of the Joka-Esplanade corridor. Even as the Purple line currently functions as a standalone corridor, once the Mominpore-Esplanade section starts operation, commuters from the existing North-South and the upcoming East-West Metros can hop on from either of the two lines to the Joka-Esplanade corridor. All three lines will merge at the Metro hub in Esplanade. ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/lowest-bidder-emerges-for-5km-maidan-metro-tunnel/articleshow/101266453.cms

They are just saving to do it later,” Chatterjee told TOI.LTIMindtree was in the news recently for putting Mindtree candidates through a training process before being onboarded, after delaying the onboarding for a year. Chatterjee said this rule was adopted by LTIMindtree during the process of integrating Larsen and Toubro Infotech (LTI) and Mindtree.“The Ignite programme (of training freshers prior to onboarding) was introduced two years back by LTI. The objective was for these freshers to get some experience before being onboarded. While integrating the two entities, we picked up the best practices of both and decided to introduce it to Mindtree candidates also,” he said. The combined entity’s headcount dropped in the final quarter of 2022-23 by around 2,000 on a sequential basis because of a hiring freeze. The company did not hire as there were delays in deals materialising. In the current financial year (2023-24), the firm wants to utilise its bench and avoid hiring laterals. The company’s employee utilisation dropped from nearly 83% in the December quarter to 81. 7% in the March quarter.The company plans to shut down certain offices as part of a move to cut costs.

It commenced the trial injecting 40% hydrogen gas in ‘E’ blast furnace from Sunday. The trial will continue for four to five days in what is the world’s first instance of hydrogen gas injection of such a large quantity into a blast furnace.The move has the potential to reduce coke rate by 10%, translating into 7-10% reduction in carbon emissions per ton of steel produced. The trial is part of Tata Steel’s carbon direct avoidance (CDA) approach focused on the blast furnace, one of the heaviest known industrial contributors to carbon emissions worldwide. It expects the trial to provide insights into operating blast furnaces with greener fuel injectants, said Tata Steel VP (iron making) Uttam Singh. It will also help the company accelerate its foray into green steelmaking, even as it aims to meet its 2045 net-zero carbon emissions goal. The move to use hydrogen comes as India, the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US, has set green hydrogen consumption targets for certain manufacturing sectors like steel in order to generate demand for cleaner fuel in its pursuit to reach net zero by 2070. In August last year, Larsen & Toubro commissioned its first green hydrogen plant at its engineering complex in Hazira, Gujarat. The plant, which was set up at a cost of Rs 25 crore, produces 45kg of green hydrogen daily, and is used for its own consumption at Hazira.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-steel-tests-hydrogen-in-furnace-to-cut-carbon-output/articleshow/99740768.cms

MDL, in turn, will take responsibility for constructing and delivering the submarines,” an official said.Spanish firm Navantia and South Korean Daewoo are the other foreign contenders in the competition for the `Project-75 India’ project, which was first granted “acceptance for necessity” by the Indian defence ministry way back in November 2007.The P-75I was supposed to be the first project under the “strategic partnership” policy promulgated in May 2017, but has been dogged by huge delays.Under the global tender finally issued in July 2021, MDL or the private Larsen & Toubro shipyard will be selected to build the six stealth conventional submarines, with both land-attack cruise missiles and air-independent propulsion (AIP), with foreign collaboration.The commercial-technical bids now have to be submitted by August 1 after several extensions. French and Russian companies are out of the race because they do not have submarines with operational AIP, which extends the underwater endurance of diesel-electric submarines, as earlier reported by TOI.It will take almost a decade for the first such submarine to roll out after the contract is eventually inked. Apart from the six new French-origin Scorpene submarines, constructed under the over Rs 23,000 crore `Project-75’ at MDL, the Navy is grappling with just six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines in its conventional underwater fleet.China, incidentally, has over 50 diesel-electric and 10 nuclear submarines.

According to a report in Economic Times (ET), in a snub to companies such as Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, Tata Power, GMR and others; DoT may not give 5G spectrum to enterprises for private networks. These companies have been calling for allocation of airwaves without auctions, a demand strongly opposed by telecom companies Airtel and Reliance Jio. Indian telcos have been lobbying against direct allocation of 5G spectrum to companies.The DoT is reportedly of the view that it won’t be feasible to directly allot spectrum to enterprises for private networks under the present legal framework. This is said to be in line with the attorney general R Venkataramani’s advice backing auctions. “If any enterprise wants to roll out its captive network, it can be done utilising the options already notified by DoT, including leasing of spectrum from telecom operators,” an official told ET.The report further added that DoT will soon inform the cabinet and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) about its decision. Incidentally, this contradicts the initial guidelines on private networks released by the DoT in 2022.Tech companies vs telecom companiesThe issue of direct allocation of 5G spectrum to enterprises has been a controversial one, pitting technology companies against telecom service providers in the country. Telecom companies have opposed any direct allocation, contending that this would distort the level playing field and give technology players a backdoor entry to provide 5G services to enterprises. On their part, tech companies want spectrum directly from the government for setting up captive networks, saying enterprises should not need to depend on telcos.Untitled Carousel 100079577 99457751What may have turned the things for telcosFaced with the opposition from telcos, the DoT sought the attorney general’s (AG’s) view. He reportedly said that auctions are the preferred mode of allotting natural resources such as spectrum. According to the report, he further said that while the government can take a stand on the classification of spectrum and contend that a particular bandwidth does not need to be auctioned, questions could be raised at a later stage, as happened in the 2G case.

The constriction for the final lap of the Joka-Esplanade or Purple Line includes twin tunnels running through four underground stations at Kidderpore, Victoria Memorial, Park Street and Esplanade.PM Narendra Modi virtually launched the truncated 6.5km overhead section from Joka to Taratala of the Purple Line on December 30.Preparations are underway so that construction of the Mominpur-Esplanade section can start later this year. The contractor will have to deploy two new tunnel boring machines (TBMs) with another on stand-by.

Even this, he says, will likely return to normal by the second quarter of this financial year. He says the company is getting a lot of deals that are focused on bringing efficiency, rather than digital transformation projects that yield quicker revenue inflows. “Clients do not want to stop transformation projects. They are just saving to do it later,” the chief executive officer told TOI. LTIMindtree was in the news recently for putting Mindtree candidates through a training process before being onboarded, after delaying the onboarding process for a year. Chatterjee said this rule was adopted by LTIMindtree during the process of integrating Larsen and Toubro Infotech (LTI) and Mindtree. “The Ignite program (of training freshers prior to onboarding) was introduced two years back by LTI. The objective was for these freshers to get some experience before being onboarded. While integrating the two entities, we picked up the best practices of both and decided to introduce it to Mindtree candidates also,” he said. The combined entity’s headcount dropped in the final quarter of 2022-23 by around 2,000 on a sequential basis because of a hiring freeze. The company did not hire as there were delays in deals materialising. In the current financial year (2023-24), the firm wants to utilise its bench and avoid hiring laterals. The company’s employee utilisation dropped from 82.9% in the December quarter to 81.7% in the March quarter. The company plans to shut down certain offices as part of a move to cut costs. Chatterjee did not mention specifically which offices would be closed. During Covid, the two entities (LTI and Mindtree) had opened satellite offices in Bengaluru and set up offices in smaller towns to facilitate a hybrid working model.

The work was carried out from March 11 to 27.With a length and width of 210 and 32.3 metre, respectively, and registered tonnage of 35,300T, the USNS Matthew Perry was named after Navy Commodore Matthew C.

The first one was Charles Drew that completed voyage repair at the shipyard in August 2022.The larger scope of work on Matthew Perry reflects the United States Navy’s intention to work towards routinely accomplishing a broader scope of vessel repairs in Indian shipyards.USNS Matthew Perry’s visit demonstrates the commitment of the US Navy and Department of Defence to utilize repair facilities in India, after US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken expressed intent at the US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in Washington, DC in April 2022.United States Consul General in Chennai Judith Ravin said, “The United States is a proud Indo-Pacific nation, and our vital interests are inextricably tied to the region.

The trainer aircraft, which have an indigenous content of around 56% at present, will be supplied to the IAF over the next six years.The Rs 3,108 crore contract for the three cadet training ships, in turn, was inked with private sector major Larsen & Toubro. The ships will be designed and built at the L&T shipyard in Kattupalli (Tamil Nadu), with the first vessel slated for delivery in 2026.The turbo-prop HTT-40s, which have ""good low-speed handling qualities and provide better training effectiveness"", will address the existing shortage of BTA for rookie pilots in the IAF, an official said.The IAF had earlier inducted 75 Swiss Pilatus BTA under a Rs 2,896 crore deal inked in May 2012. But the government later scrapped the case to acquire 38 more such planes after the Swiss company was found to have hired absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, as was then reported by TOI.The three ships to be built by L&T will cater to the training of officer cadets, including women, at sea after their basic training to meet the future requirements of the Navy. The ships, which will also provide training to cadets from friendly countries, can also be deployed for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief along with evacuation of people.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trainer-planes-ships-mod-inks-10k-cr-deals/articleshow/98488830.cms

The HC further said that no right is accrued in favour of an applicant even where the state government has recommended the case for grant of mining lease and the application is pending before the central government.The recent ruling came while dismissing a petition filed by a construction giant after its application for mining lease was treated to have lapsed with the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, coming into effect.Initially, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015, came into force on January 12, 2015, introducing the auction regime in place of first come first serve principle. With it all pending ML applications became ineligible, except for those holding PL as was the case with Larsen & Toubro.Subsequently, there was complete transition to the auction regime with the new Act coming into effect from March 28, 2021 and all applications received prior to the amendment were treated as lapsed.The two-judge bench of Justice B R Sarangi and Justice M S Sahu said, ""Their (applicant's) right is only to make an application, which was given by the policy then existing, and if the policy is changed by way of an amendment to the law, one cannot be stated to have any right based on the earlier policy, which now does not hold good or find any place in the statute.""The bench ruled in its March 2 order, ""Applying the above principle to the present context, an inevitable conclusion would arrive that the applications of the petitioners were merely under a processing stage at that time. Therefore, the case of the petitioner was not a pending case. Thereby, by introduction of the newly inserted provision in the MMDR Amendment Act, 2021, the applications of the petitioners have lapsed.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/cuttack/orissa-hc-bins-plea-against-mining-lease-lapse/articleshow/98618673.cms

He is ,"BELAGAVI: Belagavi (South) MLA Abhay Patil has found a different solution to mitigate the disruption in water supply in the city at the onset of summer. He is digging 73 borewells in his constituency to find an immediate solution to the problem, since elections are inching closer. Water supply system in the city has been badly disrupted for the past month. People are miffed with the authorities as in many areas, they are getting tap water once in a fortnight. Many posh areas in the heart of the city are also getting water supply once in 5-7 days. According to MLA Patil, digging borewells is a temporary solution to the problem.It is a known fact that the problem lies with the supply system. Two decades ago, Rakaskop dam was the only source of water to the city. However, now Hidkal dam has been added as another source. Hidkal dam project has been implemented to provide 24X7 water to the people of the city up to 2032. Problem is not the water but with the supply chain, which has not been improved in the past two decades. Thus, despite having a ‘smart city’ tag, Belagavi is reeling under huge shortage of water.According to MLA Abhay Patil, the problem has arisen due to Larsen and Toubro (L&T) not performing its water supply duties properly. “L&T has a responsibility of ensuring proper supply of water to the city. If water supply channel has any problem, the company should supply water through tankers but it is not doing so. Besides this, there are many management-related issues with L&T that is creating problems in the city,” he said. According to MLA Patil, regarding the rising water supply disruptions in the city, a meeting has been called in Bengaluru on Friday with the officials of L&T, urban development department and Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation (KUIDFC). The issues will be discussed in detail during the meeting, he said. MLA Patil said he wants urban development department to cancel the agreement with L&T and impose penalty on the company. He also wants the water supply services to be handed over to Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Sewage Department (KUWSSD) at the earliest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/bgavi-mla-opts-to-dig-borewells-to-mitigate-water-supply-issue/articleshow/99004721.cms

He crawls inside the dug up portion and bends almost double to chip away at the rock under the highway using a jackhammer to scoop out a tunnel.Pipe jacking or microtunnelling is used for installing underground pipelines, ducts and culverts. Usually, hydraulic jacks push specially designed pipes through the ground behind a shield. At the same time, excavation is taking place within the shield. At the end of it, a flexible, structural, watertight, finished pipeline as the tunnel is excavated is ready.But Jay Jay Ram and his co-workers, who also call it the jack pushing method, are doing the job manually in Baner. There is no extensive digging or disruption to the flow of traffic on the highway. It needs skilled individuals who manually cut through the rock while tunnelling under the highway, creating a corridor for the pipeline.Amrit Lal, a 25-year-old from Uttar Pradesh, said where there is no permission to dig the road, such as here in Baner, they are instructed to use the jack pushing technique. ""Initially, we lay a small rail line in the direction provided by the engineer and then proceed with manual digging. Currently, our team consists of six people, and we charge is Rs 5,500 per metre. The total length here is 60m, and we have already completed 50% of the water pipeline work. It will take us another 15 days to finish the rest,"" he said.He has been doing such jobs for seven years working in Indore, Ujjain, Rajgarh, and is now in Pune. ""I can crawl the entire length inside the pipe and return in less than a minute,"" he said.Amrit said he uses a jackhammer, and fixes the machine when it breaks down. ""We cut the large pipe into smaller sections and lay the small pipeline inside it. Once we complete a portion of the digging, we weld the small pipeline to the already laid conduit. We then employ a hydraulic system, powered by a power pack, to push the pipe section further inside,"" he added.A hydraulic jack can do the work too, but, he said the machine is best suited for works worth crores which is beyond the budget of some civic administrations. ""Also, while drilling under the road, there are numerous electric, telephone, and internet lines that can be severed by the machine,"" he said.It is a hard day's work. ""We have worked with teams comprising 12 to 15 people, and there have been no accidents. We stay on the project site throughout working day and night. Our day begins at 7am and ends at 11pm,"" he said.The contractor Mehboob Alam, 45, is originally from Bihar but now lives in Delhi. They are laying a 40-inch diameter pipeline for the 24x7 water supply project introduced in Baner and Balewadi. The contract for the project was awarded to Larsen & Toubro, and his team takes on the sub-contract. He has hired Amrit Lal's team.""Highways cannot be broken up to lay a pipeline. I have been in this line of work for 15 years and taken up contracts in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and now in Maharashtra,"" he said.He added that 15 years ago they used this road boring technique in Delhi since traffic congestion is a problem and open road digging is not feasible.

LTIMindtree, formed when the merger of Larsen & Toubro's IT unit with Mindtree closed in November 2022, said net profit fell to 10.01 billion rupees ($123.4 million) in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from 10.05 billion rupees a year earlier. Its revenue from operations rose 25.3% to 86.2 billion rupees. But that was more than offset by a roughly 32% jump in direct costs and an about 37% increase in selling, general and admin costs in the quarter. Of that, sub-contracting and employee costs, accounting for nearly 83% of the total expenses, grew by 32.1%. That dragged the Mumbai-based company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins down to 13.9% from 18.5%. Large Indian IT service providers have reported a mixed bag of earnings so far as the pandemic-driven boom is slowly being replaced by tighter client spending due to growing fears of a recession. Market leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd missed profit estimates and flagged challenges in Europe, while No.2 Infosys Ltd beat profit estimates and raised its annual revenue outlook helped by a strong deal pipeline.

A decision on this was passed during the general body meeting held in the HDMC office in Dharwad on Friday.Hubballi-Dharwad mayor Iresh Anchatgeri observed that L&T has been unresponsive to the problems faced by people and this had led to lapses in service. Therefore, the HDMC has decided to impose a penalty of Rs 25 lakh on the company.Earlier, there was a uproar by corporators of all the parties, including the ruling BJP, who alleged that L&T officials were not attending to the problems of people and had failed to meet the dealine in excuting the water pipeline installation work.The corporators swarmed L&T officials seeking reply to their problems. When the L&T representatives failed to give a proper reply, mayor Anchatgeri told L&T to complete the work within a set deadline or the company would be penalised Rs 25 lakh each month for the delay in completing works.Former mayor and corporator Radhabai Safare raised the issue of water contamination and said that two persons in her ward had to be admitted to hospital after drinking contaminated water. She held the L&T responsible for this.Joining her, corporator Shivu Hiremath and floor leader Tippanna Majjagi charged that L&T had supplied untreated water to the twin cities for four months. The rotating filter at the Amminbhavi bulk water filter house had been defunct and without bringing this issue to the notice of the HDMP, L&T had supplied water to the public, he said.The corporators demanded the mayor to impose a penalty of Rs 1 crore on L&T. Replying to this, HDMP commissioner B Gopal Krishna said the rotating filter was being upgraded but the water output was filtered thoroughly and then supplied to the public. Even random samples in several wards were tested and there were no evidence of water contamination.During the heavy rains that lashed the twin cities in the first week of October, pipelines in 38 points had leaked and the drinking water got mixed with drain water leading to contamination. The corporators said even after they filed complaints with L&T, no action to plug the leakages.Expressing dissapointment over the negligent attitude of L&T, the mayor slammed the officials and imposed a penalty of Rs 25 lakh. He directed them to repair all the pipelines in 38 wards where water contanimation was reported within 15 days.He also announced that a house committee would be formed and a nodal officer will be appointed to monitor the works taken up by the Larsen &Toubro.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/hdmc-slaps-25-lakh-fine-on-lt-for-water-supply-woes/articleshow/95156031.cms

The main T3 road will remain at its existing level. The taxiway will be on an elevated bridge eight metres above it.The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have started examining Delhi International Airport Ltd's (DIAL) request to clear the ECT for operations, and that is why sources across agencies said a September date is likely.BCAS DG Zulfiquar Hasan recently visited the site and had a joint meeting with Delhi Police, CISF, Intelligence Bureau and DIAL.Following the meeting, DIAL was asked to implement measures that included setting up elevated sentry posts on either side of the taxiway to allow two jumbo jet-size aircraft to simultaneously taxi. The posts will come up on the side of the carriageways on either lane for emergency vehicles such as fire tenders or tow tractors that would be needed if a plane has breakdown on the taxiway.""None of the suggested security measures will spoil the view of aircraft taxiing overhead. At least 10 airports around the world (such as Singapore's Changi airport or Germany's Leipzig/Halle airport) have elevated taxiways. The security set-ups in all these places were studied.

Once the operator implements them, BCAS will again visit (the site) before giving the clearance from the security angle. The DGCA is examining the taxiway from the operational angle,"" a source said.Comments were awaited from DIAL till this paper went to press. Among other things, the DGCA will examine the taxiway's longitudinal gradient compliance according to its standards.Built by engineering giant Larsen & Toubro, the ECT was supposed to open last summer but was delayed because of Covid-19.The ECT will have a 148-metre-long bridge section over the main road (northern access road) between T3 and Mahipalpur as well as a smaller 43.8-metre bridge on the road along the T3-side airport boundary wall that leads to behind the Centaur Hotel.

He will hand over the reins to CEO & MD S N Subrahmanyan (63), who will take over as executive chairman from October 1, when Naik becomes chairman emeritus. Naik, however, is expected to continue to wield influence over L&T’s affairs as he will remain chairman of L&T Employee Trust, the single largest shareholder of the Rs 1.9-lakh-crore enterprise. While Subrahmanyan will be re-designated as chairman and MD, L&T sees no legal basis to appoint a CEO in his place. Subrahmanyam will have seven years to be at the helm of the board of L&T as the retirement age for executive chairman and MD is 70 years.In a regulatory filing, the company said, Naik, who became CEO in 1999 and chairman in 2003, has decided to relinquish his responsibilities with effect from September 30. It added that he has been conferred the status of chairman emeritus by the board. The octogenarian will join the list of long-standing directors/promoters such as Ratan Tata, Adi Godrej and K P Singh of DLF who have been appointed as chairperson emeritus of the companies/groups they have been part of. Though law doesn’t recognise a chairperson emeritus title, s/he can be an invitee to the company’s board meeting without having rights to vote. L&T had restructured leadership roles to extend Naik’s tenure. In 2012, it split the post of chairman and MD to allow Naik to continue as chairman. Five years later, it redesignated Naik as its non-executive chairman. He will step down from this position by September end. Naik, who is widely acknowledged as the architect of the transformation of L&T, will leave his imprint on the company. During his tenure, the market cap of L&T — which was founded by two Danish nationals in 1946 — rose to Rs 3.3 lakh crore on Wednesday from Rs 5,815 crore in 1999. Revenue and profit increased to Rs 1.9 lakh crore and Rs 10,471 crore in FY23 from Rs 7,292 crore and Rs 471 crore in 1999, respectively. Naik also managed to fend off takeover attempts by Reliance Industries and Aditya Birla Group in the early 2000s and conceptualised L&T Employee Trust by ring-fencing the company from future takeover attempts. He also led L&T into new businesses including defence and IT services. A source said, while Naik is very agile mentally, he has his ups and downs physically as people his age would have. He wanted to cut down his assignments and focus on matters close to his heart, like philanthropy, and this (stepping down) is a part of succession planning, the source added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/naik-hands-over-lts-reins-to-subrahmanyan/articleshow/100146718.cms

This project ","CHENNAI: Earlier this year, 25 kids from Chennai schools made it to the prestigious ‘Dr A P J Abdul Kalam Satellite Launch Vehicle Mission 2023’. This project brought together 5,000 schoolchildren from Classes VI to XII from all over India to learn about designing and developing 150 PICO satellites, which were launched by the sounding rocket on February 19, 2023, from a coastal hamlet near Chennai. Cracking a major national programme like this one was a breakthrough for the 25 Chennai schoolchildren who were part of engineering major Larsen & Toubro’s engineering futures (EF)programme. For the company, it was validation that its back-to-school projects are in a class of their own.The EF programme (launched in 2019) is one of two major CSR projects L&T has in Tamil Nadu – the other being Every Child A Scientist or ECAS (since 2020). The aim: To kindle scientific temper and critical thinking among students of government schools. Both programmes aim to bridge educational gaps by helping students use technology and work with cutting-edge teaching and learning resources. The EFprogramme integrates the four disciplines of STEM (science, technology, engineering, maths) into a learning paradigm based on real-world applications. The ECAS program me helps children improve their academic scores and provides them opportunities to learn about the earth and atmospheric sciences, biology, agriculture, health and nutrition, physics, chemistry. So far, nearly 16,000 students from 50 schools in Tamil Nadu have been covered in the last threeand-a-half years. L&T officials say the aim is to ensure students do not get spooked by science and maths. “The EF programme strives to ignite children’s innate creativity and curiosity. By offering experiential learning, complex concepts become more accessible and maths and science become less daunting,” says Mabel Abraham, head-CSR, L&T. For the EF project, L&T has partnered with the NGO American India Foundation to cover Classes VI to VIII in government schools in Chennai, Kanchipuram, Chengalpet, and Tiruvallur districts.The project supports schools with digital infrastructure and education kits including videos, animation, and power-point presentations for interactive, multi-media classroom sessions. But the most critical part is training teachers in new methodologies combining digital and activitybased teaching. So far, 338 teachers have been covered under the EF and another 403 under the ECAS programme. “Teachers have observedincreased engagement among students,” says Abraham.The EF programme also promotes STEM clubs in schools, workshops on aerodynamics and space technology based on drones, virtualreality and satellites, and participating in Sir CV Raman STEM expo. L&T is also setting up a SILC centre (STEM innovation and learning centre) for which a single school has been designated as a hub for students. To be inaugurated this month, the SILC centre will be provided with basic to semi advanced robotics.As for ECAS, this programme has been done in association with MSSwaminathan Research Foundation. One of its activities is a two-week science learning session in which nearly 300 middle school students (Classes VI to VIII) from Chennai Corporation schools participate. The sessions use digital e-learning modules with digital smart boards, audio-visual learning, as well as hands-on sessions on scientific concepts. Integration of practical sessions, laboratory based hands-on interactions (ECAS lab, biotechnology, microbiology and lichen labs) help bridge the gap between theory and practice.Under this programme too, the company conducts some special activities for children. For instance, from May 16 to 30 this year, around 30 schoolchildren from Classes VI to X participated in an ECAS course at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation in Chennai. “They were exposed to a variety of fields including biodiversity, molecular biology, microbiology, geospatial information system among others,” says Abraham.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/lt-projects-aim-to-stem-the-tide-in-tamil-nadu-classrooms/articleshow/101444803.cms

To hand over the tunnelling route map to the contractor, RVNL will need the state transport department's approval. It also needs working permission from the defence ministry.""We have written several letters to the state transport department to give us the formal approval. It should have been issued by now since all parties - the police, KMC, PWD, KMRC and the Army - have verbally agreed to our proposal,"" an RVNL official said. ""By now, we could have started construction of the new market, which will come up within 50m of the existing one,"" he added.Asked to comment, a transport department official said, ""There are some issues over the cost of land.

LT,2023-11-29T10:45:00+05:30,Team TOI Plus,How a banned mining method came in handy in tunnel rescue mission,India News: Uttarakhand govt says ‘experts’ in rat-hole mining managed to dig through the tricky last metres at Silkyara tunnel and helped lay a rescue passage fo,"In what is seen as a triumph of man over machine, a team of rat-hole miners on November 28 dug through the last 10 or 12-metre stretch of debris at the collapsed portion of the Silkyara tunnel and helped rescuers bring out the 41 workers trapped there since November 12.The drilling was earlier carried out by a huge auger machine that got stuck in the rubble on November 24 at around 47 metres.Rat-hole mining is a controversial and hazardous procedure in which miners in small groups go down narrow burrows to excavate small quantities of coal. There is a National Green Tribunal (NGT) ban in place on this practice.Uttarakhand government’s nodal officer Neeraj Khairwal, however, made it clear that the men brought to the site were not rat-hole miners but people who are experts in the technique.“We have just crossed 50 metres,” Larsen and Toubro team leader Chris Cooper told PTI early on November 28. It raised hopes of an early evacuation as rescuers have to go only up to 10 metres to make a breakthrough.What is rat-hole mining?Despite a ban, rat hole mining is rampant in northeastern states such as Meghalaya and Assam. It involves digging of very small tunnels, usually only 3-4 feet deep, in which workers, more often children, enter and extract coal. Rat-hole mining is broadly of two types – side-cutting and box-cutting.Although the coal is of bad quality, people see it as a treasure-chest. In backward regions, where there is loss of livelihood, lack of employment opportunities and under-education, people see rat-hole mines as an opportunity to earn their daily bread.  medium105581271Why is it popular in Meghalaya?Rat-hole mining is a preferred choice in Meghalaya as mechanised mining is not economically viable due to its hilly terrain. It is seen as a ‘minimum investment, maximum returns’ business model. Therefore, private miners resort to this type of illegal extraction of coal and supply it to other states.The NGT ban Nine years after it was banned, the practice of rat-hole coal mining is still rampant in Meghalaya owing to what many see as an unholy nexus between a section of politicians, bureaucrats and coal barons.The NGT had imposed a ban on it in 2014, terming it as unscientific. Recurring accidents and safety of miners were among of the reasons why the Tribunal prohibited the practice.In January 2021, six workers lost their lives after a crane collapsed into the pit of a coal mine in the Sorkari forest. In December 2018, at least 17 labourers died when the mine they were working in at Ksan got submerged.On June 4, 2019, the green court slapped a ₹ 100-crore fine on the Meghalaya government for its failure to curb illegal coal mining, which has to be paid from taxes. Last year, a court-appointed committee headed by Justice BP Katakey (retired) had submitted a hard-hitting report, saying except for notifying the Meghalaya Minerals (Prevention of Illegal Mining, Transportation and Storage) Rules, 2022 on March 24, 2022, none of the directions issued by the Supreme Court and the NGT had been complied with by the authorities concerned.Will the ban work?So, the question is – why is it so difficult to enforce the ban? Prior to the 2014 ban, the coal mining industry was among the biggest revenue earners for Meghalaya, generating about ₹700 crore annually, according to government reports cited by media.“The money from the coal brought a new level of prosperity to the lives of coal mine owners and many of them became crorepatis, and most of them are now contractors, politicians…” Baniateilang Majaw, who teaches at department of political science, Seng Khasi College, Shillong, wrote for Economic and Political Weekly.“The tribal land system in Meghalaya is mainly community owned (Sixth Schedule of the Constitution) or privately owned and the landowners have absolute right over resources both on and below the land. Owing to the state government’s support, bureaucrats and politicians, irrespective of their political affiliations have benefitted from rat-hole mining,” according to the article. medium105581074Triumph of human labourAs rescuers in India on November 28 successfully pulled out all 41 construction workers trapped inside the under-construction tunnel after 17 days, the global media hailed the rescue operation and provided live coverage of the dramatic development.“Outside the tunnel, there have been celebrations at the news of the first man coming out of the tunnel,” the BBC reported while providing regular updates on the rescue operation.The first workers were removed following a series of agonising setbacks, during which rescue efforts were halted when the heavy machinery used to drill through the debris broke down, forcing workers to partially dig by hand and adopt other riskier methods to bring them to safety, it said.“Video footage from the scene showed Pushkar Singh Dhami, chief minister of Uttarakhand state meeting the workers, who appeared to be in good health, as they were removed from the tunnel amid jubilant scenes,” according to a CNN report. <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WATCH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WATCH</a> | Uttarkashi (Uttarakhand) tunnel rescue: CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and Union Minister General VK Singh meet the workers who have been rescued from inside the Silkyara tunnel <a href=""https://t.co/beuPxZYpxe"">pic.twitter.com/beuPxZYpxe</a></p>— ANI (@ANI) <a href=""https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1729524329690616149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">November 28, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>British daily, The Guardian, reported that the dramatic scenes of the first men emerging on stretchers from the entrance of the Silkyara-Barkot tunnel came after over 400 hours, during which the major rescue operation hit multiple obstacles, delays and false promises of imminent rescue.“Human labour triumphed over machinery as the specialists managed to manually drill through the final 12 metres of rubble to reach the men. An ‘escape passage’ pipe was inserted, enabling the rescuers – carrying wheeled stretchers and oxygen cylinders – to enter and finally reach those inside,” the paper said in its detailed report.Military engineers and miners drill a ‘rat hole’ through debris to complete a painstaking extraction mission, said London-based daily, The Telegraph.A portion of the tunnel collapsed on November 12, blocking the exit for the workers who were inside.Food, medicines and other essentials were sent to them through a six-inch pipe pushed through the rubble of the collapsed portion.Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the successful operation to rescue the workers, asserting that it has made everyone emotional. <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""hi"" dir=""ltr"">उत्तरकाशी में हमारे श्रमिक भाइयों के रेस्क्यू ऑपरेशन की सफलता हर किसी को भावुक कर देने वाली है। <br/> <br/>टनल में जो साथी फंसे हुए थे, उनसे मैं कहना चाहता हूं कि आपका साहस और धैर्य हर किसी को प्रेरित कर रहा है। मैं आप सभी की कुशलता और उत्तम स्वास्थ्य की कामना करता हूं। <br/><br/>यह अत्यंत…</p>— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) <a href=""https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1729521654584479876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">November 28, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>In a post on X soon after the workers were brought out of the tunnel, Modi saluted the spirit of people involved in the operation and said their courage and resolve have given a new life to them.“Everyone involved in the mission has created an amazing example of humanity and teamwork,” he said.How they did itOn November 26, the 15th day that the 41 workers spent trapped, hopes were fast diminishing amidst consecutive setbacks caused by the auger machine's failure to drill beyond 45 metres. It was then that a decision was taken to deploy ‘rat-hole’ miners, which turned out to be a game-changer. The team, known for burrowing through narrow stretches, excavated the final 12 meters and reached the trapped men in less than 24 hours, a feat described by many experts as ""extraordinary.""The miners, who work for a Delhi-based private company ‘Rockwell’, undertook the operation under the supervision of the Indian Army. Team leader Wakeel Hasan told TOI they had “past experience of excavating small tunnels for laying long sewer and water pipe lines but nothing of the scale encountered during the tunnel rescue”.Devendra, one of the ‘rathole’ miners, told TOI, “The workers were so happy to see us. They hugged us when we entered the other side.”Queried on how they were assigned the job, Hasan said Navyug, the construction company building the 4.5km long Silkyara-Barkot tunnel, had called them. “The eyes of the entire country were on us and we couldn’t afford to disappoint,” said Hasan. He revealed they refused to accept money for the operation. “It was for our fellow-countrymen.”With inputs from Gaurav Talwar & Abhyudaya Kotnala, agencies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-a-banned-mining-method-came-in-handy-in-tunnel-rescue-mission/articleshow/105579383.cms

We remain focused on our fast growing business and have a lot to do in coming quarters,"" LTI's chief executive and managing director Sanjay Jalona told reporters over a call to announce its quarterly earnings.It was not immediately clear if the merger, which can lead to the creation of the sixth largest IT services firm in the country with over $3.5 billion in annual revenues, was discussed by the boards of the companies or what started the speculation.Jalona said LTI does not compete with Mindtree, 61 per cent of which is owned by parent Larsen & Toubro, for large deals in the IT space.He, however, added that whenever required both the companies collaborate on a project as per the client's requirements or based on the capabilities of a particular company. Jalona also said the company works with L&T's engineering services arm LTTS similarly.In a filing to the exchanges on Monday after reports on the proposed merger first emerged, LTI had said at present, there is nothing specific which needs to be disclosed, adding that it does not comment on speculation in the media.The merger, if it goes through, will create a company with a combined revenue of $3.5 billion, making it sixth in the pecking order by topline, behind TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra. It will have a combined market capitalisation of over $22 billion.Mindtree too has declined to comment on the merger reports, calling it speculative in nature.According to analysts, the businesses have complementarities because of the sectoral presence that they have. While Mindtree derives a larger share of its revenue from communications, media and technology, retail, consumer packaged goods and manufacturing sectors, LTI is strong in banking, financial services and insurance.A merger to create a larger unit also fits well with the Larsen & Toubro group's vision to have a higher proportion of revenues from the services segment, as against its traditional forte of executing engineering projects.L&T acquired a majority stake in Mindtree in 2019 after facing some resistance in its quest to be a majority shareholder in the company. LTI has its origins in being the IT services arm of the engineering, procurement and construction major.However, investors have seemingly not been enthused by the reports of such a deal. Shares of LTI closed 6.49 per cent down at Rs 5,486.15 apiece on BSE on Tuesday, after a 2.66 per cent decline in the previous session, while Mindtree ended 8.13 per cent down at Rs 3,638.70 following a 3.33 per cent drop on Monday.

They include the BMC officers, engineers in Larsen & Toubro and Hindustan Construction Company, and a battery of consultants specialising in areas such as tunnelling, dredging and bridge design. Some may have not had the skill sets needed to help construct a road over the sea, but the knack for crisis management and coordination stood them in good stead. Traffic diversion, moving utility lines and working near the coast were among the key challenges they overcame. Ashwini Bhide, a 1995 batch IAS officer, was given charge of the Coastal Road project in 2020. Bhide's role in co-ordinating with various agencies, resolving knotty issues including diversion of utilities, traffic and grievances of the fishermen community stood out. ""With Bhide at the helm, the process of obtaining permissions and clearances became faster,"" said an official. On her part, Bhide says delays were expected given the complexities including the interchanges, reclamation of land, the disruption caused by Covid and litigation. MM Swami, chief engineer (south) for BMC, also had a key role as he has been involved right since June 2017. Swami, 54, was a prime mover in various capacities. Swami played a significant part in tackling the legal challenges, which included five PILs and one writ petition. ""Plans had to be revised for every change and approvals and permissions had to be sought each time. While accommodating concerns of other agencies, Swami had to go back to the drawing board for every alteration,"" said an official.""This project encompasses all aspects of civil engineering. The total length of all the bridges on the road is 18 km and this itself can be a separate project. Reclamation, that too six to seven metres in depth and getting the material for it was a challenge. We also had to be careful while tunnelling, especially building a tunnel under the reservoir on Malabar Hill, which was 110 years old,"" said Swami. Dr John Celentano, a tunnelling expert from AECOM Asia, is another figure who commands admiration. Celentano has been involved right from 2018. From choosing the boring machine used to incorporating fire safety measures of the highest standard, Celentano had a say on all aspects. The Coastal Road's all-weather tunnels are flood- and fire-proof. BMC officials say the state-of-the-art ventilation system too bears his imprint. Sandeep Singh, project director with L&T, and Anantha Padmanabhan, DGM (interface) with L&T, are also regarded part of the core team that shaped the work. Singh, a 46-year-old civil engineer and management graduate came with the experience of working on the Delhi Metro. Padmanabhan, on the other hand, has the Burj Khalifa on his CV. BMC officials say it was Singh's decision to rotate the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) at the spot and start boring for the second tunnel from the Girgaum Chowpatty side rather than dismantle and relaunch it from the Priyadarshini Park end. ""Due to this one decision, we managed to save a few months of time,"" said a BMC official. Singh said, ""since the start, there have been many hurdles like Covid and court cases. Despite this, we did well, and we are satisfied."" ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/the-men-and-women-who-drove-mumbais-coastal-road-forward/articleshow/99257186.cms

The three training ships, in turn, will be designed and built at the private Larsen & Toubro shipyard in Kattupalli (Tamil Nadu) for Rs 3,108 crore, with the first vessel slated for delivery in 2026. 98256812Both the projects have been hanging fire for a long time. With the turbo-prop HTT-40 taking a long time to become operational, the IAF in particular has been grappling with a major shortage of basic trainer aircraft (BTA) to train its rookie pilots.The government a few years ago had rejected the IAF’s case to acquire 38 more Swiss Pilatus BTA, to add to the 75 already inducted under a Rs 2,896 crore deal inked in May 2012, after the foreign company was found to have hired absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, as was then reported by TOI.98309740Now, after the first 70 HTT-40 aircraft are delivered, the IAF plans to go in for another 36 such planes. “HTT-40 is designed to have good low-speed handling qualities and provide better training effectiveness. This fully aerobatic tandem-seat turbo trainer has an air-conditioned cockpit, modern avionics, hot refuelling, running changeover and zero-zero ejection seats,” a MoD official said on Wednesday.“The contract will include associated equipment and training aids, including simulators. The HTT-40 currently has 56% indigenous content, which will progressively go up to over 60%. The aircraft can also be upgraded to incorporate the futuristic requirements of the armed forces,” he added.The three ships, in turn, will cater to the training of officer cadets, including women, at sea after their basic training to meet the future requirements of the Navy. The ships, which will also provide training to cadets from friendly countries, can also be deployed for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief along with evacuation of people.The MoD said the HTT-40 procurement has the potential to provide direct employment to around 1,500 personnel and indirect employment for up to 3,000 people spread over more than 100 MSMEs.The ship project, in turn, will generate an employment of 22.5 lakh man-days over a period of four-and-half years. “This will encourage active participation of Indian shipbuilding and associated industries, including MSMEs,” the official said.“With the majority of the equipment and systems sourced from indigenous manufacturers, these vessels will be a proud flag bearer of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ in consonance with the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative,” he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ccs-clears-rs-10000-crore-procurements-of-trainer-aircraft-ships/articleshow/98340802.cms

L&T is constructing the Ram Mandir. The finished teak will be used for carving religious symbols on the first floor of the main temple,” said FDCM’s regional manager Sumit Kumar. This is the first order for over 1,500 cubic feet. More orders will be placed for other construction activities on other floors and guesthouses. The contractor’s preference was for Central Province Teak (CPT) which is available only in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. According to FDCM officials, there were three choices before the users. One was teak from Burma, CPT, and Kerala’s Nilambur. As teak from Burma was rejected and the production of Nilambur species has shrunk, teak from Maharashtra was the first preference. The reference to FDCM’s teak was also given by the Uttar Pradesh Forest Development Corporation (UPFDC) officials.“The Ram Temple Trust too enquired about the best quality teak at many places but they found Allapalli teak to be the best for this special and unique work,” said Kumar. The L&T team and temple trust representatives were accompanied by FDCM’s Kumar and assistant manager Ganesh Motkar. The team also included the architect and quality controller for the inspection of sawn cut sizes. “The team verified sawn timber pieces for their use. They were happy with the quality. FDCM has ventured into the sawn timber segment and is now operating five sawmills in Allapalli region. Gadchiroli’s teak is said to be one of the finest woods in the country,” said Kumar.Since January 2022, FDCM has provided sawn timber for many prestigious projects, including Central Vista (New Sansad Bhawan), DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai, and Satara Sainik School, Satara. “We also offer sawn timber to retail customers. We are in the process of signing an MoU with the Indian post office for the supply of sawn timber to any remote part of India,” said Kumar. Chandrapur and Gadchiroli regions have dense forests dominated by teak wood (Tectona Grandis). The FDCM, a wholly-owned state government company, was established in 1974. It is harvesting timber with five divisions as per the management plans and permission from the MoEFCC.FDCM commercially harvests about 50,000 cubic meters of timber from its mature teak plantations.

A massive 7. 75 lakh acres of land has been earmarked by the state government for green hydrogen projects, pegged to be the largest-ever industrial land bank set aside for allocation in India for green hydrogen manufacturing.District administrations were already working on fixing land price estimates, however, decisions on allocation for these projects were pending due to the assembly elections, and are now being fast tracked.While Reliance Industries Limited (4. 74 lakh acres), Adani Group (1. 97 lakh acres) and Torrent Group (1. 04 lakh acres) have already moved proposals for land, more players have expressed interest.“These three key players have sought land in Kutchand Banaskantha districts. While Reliance and Adani Group have already received in-principle approval from the government, Torrent Group has been asked to seek land elsewhere as the parcel it is eyeing is a forest area,” a top government source confirmed.Industry sources said Larsen and Toubro Group, NTPC and Reliance are already working on pilot projects to understand various applications of green hydrogen. Recently, Delhi-based Greenzo Energy India announced it will invest $50 million (Rs 414. 5 crore) to manufacture 250MW of anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysers per year with balance of plant (BOP) at Sanand Industrial Estate-II near Ahmedabad.With growing interest from global players, the state government plans to hold stakeholder consultations soon.Gujarat is gradually becoming a focal point for gre-en hydrogen due to the presence of many refineries, fertilizer, caustic soda and steel plants in the state, industry experts say.“Demand for green hydrogen is supported by the huge renewable power generation potential as well as excellent road and shipping infrastructure.“The state government is already considering reserving land parcels for hydrogen projects. However, development of green hydrogen is limited by the high cost of production in comparison to grey hydrogen and other alternative energy sources,” said Vinay Rustagi, managing director, Bridge To India, a renewable energy consulting firm.“Government interventions to incentivize domestic manufacturing, reduce transmission charges for renewable power and develop storage and transport infrastructure are needed to kickstart this market,” Rustagi further said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/green-hydrogen-projects-on-fast-track-in-gujarat/articleshow/96754863.cms

The CAG had fla","The hope — or, really, the incorrigible desire to believe things will get better — is that any catastrophe will make us stop, think and do more. Ask more questions, demand more accountability, pay more attention. But here we are again.At least 14 have died and over 100, including 23 army men, are missing after flash floods in Sikkim.The government initially said that the trigger was a cloudburst over the Lhonak lake (at 10.42pm on October 3) but the India Meteorological Department later clarified that the cause was a glacial lake outburst flood — which means a glacial lake, Lhonak, breached its boundaries. It is pretty much the same scenario that a 2021 paper had predicted, that South Lhonak’s “enormous volume of water in a highly dynamic high-mountain environment” makes it vulnerable to an outburst flood. The small village of Chungthang, it had said, was at risk. This is also what a Centre-commissioned study on the Teesta basin had said way back in 2007 — that Lhonak “poses danger”, and that one of the hydropower projects, Teesta Stage III or Teesta III, was located in one of the most ecologically sensitive areas of Sikkim.A mega project with an installed capacity of 1200MW, Teesta III is one of the largest in India built with a considerable cost overrun — going from over Rs 5,700 crore in 2006 to nearly Rs 14,000 crore by the time it was commissioned in 2017. A lot of time had gone into it, and a lot of effort.So, what might have been a bit more difficult to imagine was what actually happened within minutes of the cloudburst on October 3 — that massive 60-m high dam gave way.medium— sidagarwal (@sidagarwal) Local daily Sikkim Express quoted the chief secretary as saying that after the Lhonak breached its embankment, the waters rushed towards Teesta river: “Soon, different parts of Teesta river basin reported water level rising, with particularly alarming levels in Chungthang where Teesta Stage III dam was breached. There are 12-14 workers still stranded in the tunnels of the dam.”Clearly, scientists’ warnings had been ignored. Even the ones from those engaged by the government. But consider, for a moment, that the science involved in this takes time to get people moving (which is a terrible excuse but hold on just for the sake of the argument). What about the actual construction? The tenders, the finances, the background checks? Turns out, the Sikkim government let things slide quite often. In 2016, a year before Teesta III was commissioned, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India had flagged serious gaps in how the project was being implemented — unverified developer, ineligible engineer, ‘unscientific’ environmental impact study, and a basic failure to make sure private players did what they agreed to. Here, we reproduce excerpts from the report with some context.boxcontent11 years to build Teesta III, 6 before it was breached1980s: Sikkim government plans the Teesta III projectMay-June 2004: State government decides the project must be sped up, sets up a high-powered committeeFebruary 2005: Athena India gets the project, sets up Teesta Urja Limited (TUL) as special purpose vehicle for implementation2011: 6.9-magnitude earthquake hits Sikkim, 40 workers die in Teesta III tunnel collapse2012: First deadline for commissioning dam passes2015: State government takes over2017: Project finally commissioned medium104191208“The State Government had neither fixed any pre-qualification criteria nor had adopted the competitive bidding process for selection of project developer.”The stated point of a public-private partnership is to achieve a balance between efficient execution and community welfare. The way to do that is to figure out the basic criteria someone must meet before being considered. In this case, the government had set up a high-powered committee with the chief secretary and other government secretaries. Four proposals came in, the committee chose one. But the state government sat on the decision “for reasons not on record”.“The project was allotted to Athena India consortium based on their claims that the consortium members had the requisite experience and capabilities to implement the project within the scheduled period … The consortium leader, Athena India which was incorporated only in August 2004, had no previous experience in implementation of hydel projects.”But its partners — Power Trading Corporation of India Limited, Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation Limited, Larsen & Toubro, and Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services — did. “However, three out of these four consortium members … having technical experience in the field had exited from the consortium without the prior permission of the State Government.”Only the Power Trading Corporation of India stayed. Technical expertise was such a problem that consultants had to be hired for design and engineering. medium104191274“There was no representative of the State Government on the Board of Directors of TUL till December 2012.”The Deed of Agreement signed by the government and TUL in 2005 said that the government would give 26% — its share — in the equity capital and TUL would allocate 26% of its equity to the government by January 2006. But the equity subscription agreement was executed in 2008 (a two-year delay) and the state government contributed its share only in 2012.Meanwhile, the private developers were supposed to take care of their share — 74%. But they could not cover it. “Scrutiny of records revealed that a significant period of 416 days of the total time overrun had been lost due to controllable factors such as suspension of work due to funds constraints, dispute amongst the equity stakeholders on infusion of additional project funding, slow progress of project works due to delay in release of payments to contractors, etc.”So, financial constraints. This leads us to another thread of problems. In 2007, TUL borrowed over Rs 4,500 crore from the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and other lenders to complete the project.Their loan agreement said that “Athena” would mean Athena India and Athena Singapore. But Athena Singapore was not part of the consortium in the Deed of Agreement the Sikkim government had signed. So, REC entered the arrangement with the understanding that Athena Singapore was involved — a “back door entry”, the CAG report called it, “without verification”.Because there was no government member on the board, the state government “remained unaware” of the change in shareholding patterns giving Athena Singapore a toehold.In any case, REC was the lead lender. So, it brought in an independent engineer.“REC had engaged M/s. Lahmeyer International (India) Private Limited (Lahmeyer), a subsidiary of the German company M/s. Lahmeyer International, as lenders’ independent engineer for the project. During scrutiny of records, it was observed that the parent company, M/s. Lahmeyer International was declared (November 2006) ineligible by [the] World Bank for award of bank-financed contracts for a period of seven years because of corrupt activities in the Lesotho Highlands Water Project.”At this point (at the risk of repeating), the TUL board had no government members. So, the state government “failed to take note” of this massive lapse as well. And an ineligible engineer was approved to monitor construction and technology for the Teesta III dam.To avoid a situation like this, the Deed of Agreement needed the state government to set up a multi-disciplinary committee with representatives from TUL and state government departments. It was supposed to meet quarterly and keep monitoring what was happening. 104191305“No such multi-disciplinary committee had been constituted by the state government (November 2016) … In the absence of a multi-disciplinary committee as envisaged under the Deed of Agreement, the implementation of [the] project was not effectively monitored and execution of the project works had suffered.”When asked about the committee, the energy and power department eventually said that one departmental multi-disciplinary committee did exist in each district and they had been asked to nominate representatives. But, the CAG report said, it was already November 2016 and the project was almost completed. Not much point to it then.Finally, remember that 2007 study we referred to at the beginning? It had said Teesta III at Chungthang was in a zone “very rich” in biodiversity. When TUL prepared its Environment Impact Assessment and Environment Management Plan, “no wildlife was generally reported in the project area” and so “no adverse impact” was expected.No adverse impact indeed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sikkim-floods-once-again-cag-can-say-i-told-you-so/articleshow/104190321.cms

The hybrid course will have online classes, and the examinations will be held offline, at the NITK Surathkal campus.Dattatraya Narayan Gaonkar, HoD, department of electrical and electronics engineering, NITK, said that it is an industry-sponsored two-year regular MTech course, and currently only Bosch employees are allowed to take it. “We may allow others to take the course in the coming years. NITK, Surathkal, has signed the agreement with Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited, Bengaluru, for the start of the programme on September 16. The first batch will have 27 Bosch employees, and it will commence in October. The total intake is 40,” he said.Explaining why the course was introduced, Gaonkar said that the future of the automobile industry will be all about EVs. There is a need for such a course, in order to prepare for the next boom in the automobile sector. The course, designed in consultation with Bosch, will have strong theoretical courses and labs, covering important topics in power electronics and control for electric vehicle.This is the second PG programme offered by the department, which is one of the largest departments at NITK Surathkal, said Gaonkar. “Interestingly, this programme is the first-of-its-kind in the institution, based on the institute framework on customised PG programmes,” he said.Since the course is exclusively for working professionals, the classes are held between 5pm to 9pm, from Monday to Friday. All other regulatory requirements are as per the regular fully residential PG programmes of NITK Surathkal.The institution is offering an MTech in construction technology and management. It is sponsored by Larsen and Toubro (L&T), and started a few years ago.

","NEW DELHI: Bankers in India recorded their best-ever quarter for mergers and acquisitions while dealmaking elsewhere slows to a crawl.India saw $82.3 billion pending and completed M&A deals in the second quarter, the highest amount on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s more than twice as much than the previous record of $38.1 billion in the third quarter of 2019. Globally, M&A volume in the quarter reached $827.6 billion, down 8.7% from the same period in 2021.The surge in India was dominated by HDFC Bank Ltd.’s $60 billion all-stock purchase of Housing Development Finance Corp. in April, combining India’s most valuable bank and largest mortgage lender in the country’s biggest ever M&A transaction. The move illustrated how India’s flagship companies, facing disruptive trends such as the rise of fintech and climate change, are turning to dealmaking as a tactic to dramatically reshape themselves.92507981“While conglomerates will consolidate to become stronger and gain market share in their core sectors, there will be renewed or new initiatives around two big themes: ESG and digital,” according to Sonjoy Chatterjee, chairman and chief executive officer for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in India. The second in particular is a focus for all companies, no matter the sector, he added.“There won’t be a strategy going forward that doesn’t provide a clear path to deliver this,” Chatterjee said.The combination of Mindtree Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd., two software firms controlled by engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro Ltd., in a $3.3 billion all-stock deal announced in May further illustrated how India’s largest firms are positioning themselves for a changed landscape in technology, aided by volatility in the markets.Even without the HDFC megadeal, India’s second quarter would still rank as its fifth-best quarter on record, thanks to transactions such as billionaire Gautam Adani’s $10.5 billion deal to buy Ambuja Cements Ltd., giving his conglomerate a sizable presence in the industry.“The appetite of strategic investors has definitely increased, with market correction resetting the valuations in India,” said Ganeshan Murugaiyan, head of corporate coverage and advisory at BNP Paribas SA in India. Companies in India leading the shift to renewable energy were among the biggest dealmakers. Shell Plc agreed to buy renewable power supplier Sprng Energy Pvt for $1.5 billion in April, while French oil giant TotalEnergies SE purchased a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Ltd. this month. The firm plans to invest more than $50 billion in technologies such as green hydrogen over the next decade.Large acquisitions will be challenging to put together, Murugaiyan said. “It is not that easy to get long term financing and the high-yield leverage buyout market -- corporate loans -- is literally shut down.” Like Chatterjee, Murugaiyan sees the green and digital transitions driving more transactions. His team has grown from nine bankers in 2021 to 12 this year, and he is looking to add another three. The next wave of deals could come in the mid-market, where a cohort of aging founders is starting to hand the reins to their offspring.“Regularly, we find the next generation has interests in other themes, particularly tech platforms and ESG,” Chatterjee said. “Themes coming out of the pandemic have revised perspectives and choices around what the next generation want to do with their futures -- in a very personal way.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/record-82-billion-dealmaking-spree-sees-india-defy-global-slump/articleshow/92507948.cms

During the event, he emphasised the importance of digital transformation for all organisations and how Microsoft's cloud services can drive innovation, economic growth, and business expansion in India. Nadella also shared his vision for a tech-focused India, highlighting the role of the cloud in supporting the country's digital progress and Microsoft's efforts to innovate across various technological areas to aid India's developers, startups, and companies in various industries.“Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, and ultimately, we have to measure our success by achieving that mission, said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “In simple terms, I say, we should do well only when the world around us is doing well. One of the most fantastic things even in this trip into India that I’m learning about, is not just what’s happening in the top cities of the country, but what’s happening across all the cities in the country and how digital is playing a role.”“Let’s think about how it can augment every one of us in whatever it is that we are doing. Every knowledge worker is going to be more creative, more expressive, more productive. Every frontline worker will be able to do more knowledge work than they ever did. Every design task, whether it’s software engineering, mechanical design, architecture, is going to be that much more productive going forward. So, it’s ultimately, in my opinion, going to accelerate human creativity, human ingenuity and human productivity across a range of tasks,” said Nadella while speaking on AI. Nadella emphasised the use of Microsoft's technology and solutions by businesses in India to drive change and progress. The Ministry of Electronics and IT for the Government of India is using Azure AI to overcome language barriers through its Bhashini initiative, which aims to make it possible to translate multiple Indian languages. The State Bank of India (SBI) is using Power Apps to quickly implement internal innovation and address various challenges, such as efficiently capturing marketing leads and ensuring ATM accessibility for individuals with disabilities.Larsen & Toubro (L&T) is using Azure IoT and AI to develop a connected equipment platform that offers real-time visibility across project sites.

The Army had strongly pitched for all 354 tanks to be produced by the private sector under the Make-1 category. But the DRDO argued its Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) was already working to develop a light tank prototype with private sector giant Larsen & Toubro as the “lead system integrator”.“DRDO says its first light tank prototype will roll out by mid-2023. So, the decision is that 59 tanks be reserved for DRDO, with the condition that it delivers a successful prototype ahead of the others in the fray,” the source added.The 12-lakh strong Army had managed to deploy some of its heavier Russian-origin T-90S and T-72 main-battle tanks (40 to 50 tonne each) in eastern Ladakh after the confrontation erupted in 2020. The PLA also inducted a large number of technologically advanced mix of medium and light tanks, including the new third-generation Type-15 ones. “But the T-90S and T-72, designed for operations in plains and deserts, have limitations in high-altitude areas ranging from 11,000 to almost 17,000-feet. Consequently, the need for indigenous versatile light tanks that are more manoeuvrable and operationally flexible in mountains,” another source said.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has also impacted both the manufacturing and sustenance of the Army’s fleet of 1,200 T-90S (another 457 being manufactured under licence from Russia) and 2,400 older T-72 tanks.The Army wants the new light tanks to also incorporate niche technologies like AI, drone integration, active protection system and high degree of situational awareness, among others.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-kickstart-mega-indigenous-project-for-light-tanks-amid-confrontation-with-china/articleshow/96068248.cms

A series of soil tests will soon be carried out to ascertain the type of boring machines needed to build the twin tunnels. Authorities will soon start lifting soil samples at Chetpet. Samples have been already collected from Adyar. Building a metro rail line under a river or a water body is not new to CMRL; the existing metro rail lines pass under the Cooum river near Central. However, further tests are being planned to study the nature of the soil under the lake and the river so that engineers can be prepared for the tunnel boring stage. The tunnels under Chetpet lake will link KMC metro station with Chetpet.  93580611The two stations are part of corridor-3 from Madhavaram to Siruseri. The 118.9km phase-2 has a deadline of 2026. CMRL awarded the contract for constructing tunnels from Kellys to Taramani, which includes stretches under Chetpet lake and Adyar river, to Larsen & Toubro. “Soil test at Adyar river will be completed in a month. After that we will begin soil investigation at Chetpet lake. We may collect samples for every 100m. This is only to corroborate with the results from soil tests done earlier,” said an official. From KMC metro station, tunnels may be at a depth of 30m below the existing phase-1 tunnels at Poonamallee High Road before the tunnels take a turn towards Chetpet lake. Officials said tunnelling may not be as tough in Chetpet area as the soil is mostly sandstone compared to locations like Thirumaylai and Thiruvanmiyur, where there are charnockite rock. “We will do ground improvement to strengthen the soil before building tunnels,” an official said.

The tripartite partnership will focus on green hydrogen projects at Indian Oil’s refineries in Mathura and Panipat, while other such projects will also be evaluated across the country at the same time. “While the usage of hydrogen in the mobility sector will take its time, the refineries will be the pivot around which India’s green hydrogen revolution will materialise in a substantial way,” said Indian Oil chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya.

As per the company's officials, this is the seventh such theft case since December 2021.Notably, L&T is handling the project of laying the overhead power transmission lines from Simbhaoli to Muradnagar. The entire process of placing these lines is aimed at providing a power sub-station in Meerut, to cater to the power needs of the adjoining areas in the coming days. The project work started in January 2020 and since then, several cases of thefts were reported in many areas that fall under the project jurisdiction. These places included Meerut, Hapur and Ghaziabad. “In Hapur, police promptly traced the thieves and no theft had taken place there since. However, police in Meerut are yet to take any action which has emboldened these thieves,” said an official involved in the project. Vijay Pandey, assistant manager (administration), L&T, told TOI, ""Theft occurred at two towers placed on farmlands on June 14. Thieves took away equipment worth Rs 40 lakh. Now, work has been delayed till August-September.""Meanwhile, dismissing claims of ""police inaction"", SP (rural) Keshav Kumar said that in most cases, such thefts are results of ""connivance between company workers and thieves"".

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will participate in the consecration ceremony of the temple on January 22.For instance, while Gujarati architects designed the grand temple, Tamil Nadu artisans crafted its doors. Similarly, Rajasthan and Karnataka sent its marble, pink sandstone and Maharashtra its teak wood for the construction of the temple.TOI+ takes you through the states that are actively involved in this monumental project.Tamil Nadu artisans toiled for 6 monthsOn January 22, when the PM participates in the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple and its gold-plated, exquisitely crafted Balharshah teak doors are thrown open, a team of carpenter-artisans in Tamil Nadu will feel excitement and pride coursing through them.The team of 20 artisans and carpenters work for Kumarasamy Ramesh, who churns out woodcraft from a small shed in Mahabalipuram, 60km south of Chennai. The team has been staying in Ayodhya for the past six months to help build the temple.All 44 doors, including the main ones of the sanctum sanctorum and the shrines of Sita, Lakshman and Hanuman, were crafted by the team. They were handpicked by the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) in November 2020 when business was dull and the pandemic was raging. medium106643095The carpenter-artisans have imbibed the skills of wood carving and crafting from their forefathers. It was through a timber merchant in Hyderabad, a longtime business partner and friend, that Ramesh, 46, met two senior VHP leaders in New Delhi, including Champat Rai, the general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust.Initially, they gave Ramesh the task of creating a miniature temple out of wood. When he completed the model, Ramesh got the assignment. “I got it by god’s grace. They called me a year later and clinched the deal. We began work on June 15,” says Ramesh, making an early start at his Mahabalipuram workshed.In June, Ramesh’s team arrived in New Delhi, headed for a machinery fair and picked up tools worth ₹10 lakh before travelling to Ayodhya. The team set to work, crafting the doors in the Vesara style based on the design provided by the chief sthapathi of the temple.The Vesara style is distinct to the Deccan region, merging the Nagara and Dravida styles of the Chalukya kings. The team visited the Ajantha and Ellora caves to pick up design tips. “Everything is involved — mathematics, creativity, aesthetics and silpa sastra,” says Ramesh.Most of the sculptor-carpenters, including Ramesh, hail from Kanyakumari. His forefathers worked in the Padmanabhapuram palace as master carpenters, helping build it and subsequently overseeing its maintenance.“It is our pride to carry on the tradition,” says Ramesh’s father Kumarasamy, who started work in Kanyakumari, creating beautiful carvings on the wooden axle of bullock carts. medium106642222Ramesh picked up the skills when he was as young as 11, accompanying his uncle on assignments during school holidays. Planning the woodwork and getting the symmetry right takes skill and experience, says Kumarasamy.There are more contributions from Tamil Nadu, including a 650-kg ‘vengalam’ bell, created by craftsmen from Eral in Tuticorin district, and holy water from 16 rivers across the country, collected by P Suresh, managing director of Chennai-based realty firm Arun Excello.“We collected the water in 16 silver ‘kalasams’ [jars] and placed them in five caskets crafted by Ramesh,” says Hari Krishna, managing director of Ayush TV. Accompanied by Suresh, he collected water and sand from rivers including the Cauvery, Tungabhadra, Narmada, Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Brahmaputra, Kali Gandaki (Nepal) and the Indus from the Kashmir border.Karnataka sculptor gives shape to idolKarnataka is playing a crucial role in the Ram temple construction. Several key figures from the state such as sculptor Arun Yogiraj and Pejawar Mutt seer Sri Vishwaprasanna Thirtha Swamiji are actively involved in the project.Mysuru-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj, known for his expertise in crafting monumental works such as Netaji Subash Chandra Bose’s statue at Amar Jawan Jyoti and Adi Shankaracharya’s statue in Kedarnath, has sculpted the Ram Lalla idol.Arun’s family has a rich legacy in sculpting. His father Yogiraj and grandfather Basavanna Shilpi were acclaimed artists. In fact, Shilpi received patronage from the former kings of Mysuru. medium106642086Besides, at least three key people overseeing various aspects of the Ram temple construction hail from Karnataka, and the very foundation of the temple is sourced from the southern state.One of them is Sri Vishwaprasanna Thirtha Swamiji, the sole seer from South India in the 15-member Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust overseeing the construction of the Ram temple. He will play a prominent role in the consecration ceremony. Since joining the trust two years ago, he has shuttled between Udupi and Ayodhya to supervise the construction.In addition to this, a significant quantity of materials has been sourced from Karnataka for the construction work. Notably, Sadahalli marble, extracted near Kempegowda International Airport in Devanahalli, has played a substantial role. VHP state functionaries estimate that 700-800 tonnes of this marble have been transported to Ayodhya for the project.Furthermore, Karnataka has contributed 150kg of agarbatti, silver bricks and even gold chains intended to adorn the Ram Lalla idol.A Hyderabad man’s long march to AyodhyaWith a pair of ‘padukas’ (sandals) on his head, Hyderabad man Charla Srinivasa Sastry has set out on a 1,300km journey to Ayodhya on foot.His mission is to personally deliver the ‘golden gift’ worth around ₹1.2 crore to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister ahead of the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple on January 22.When TOI spoke to him over the telephone on January 5, Sastry was close to Chitrakoot in Madhya Pradesh and had another 280km to cover.“I started my padayatra on October 28 from Vedurpaka, from a tiny village in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. I’m hoping to reach Ayodhya in the next one week…” he said. medium106642073“Though the sandals were originally made of silver, during the course of my journey I decided to have them gold plated and sent them back to Hyderabad. The work is being done by a goldsmith based in Hasmathpet,” said Sastry, director of the Hyderabad-based Ayodhya Bhagyanagaram Sitarama Seva Trust Foundation.“Once the refurbished padukas reach me, I will resume my journey,” he added. Sastry is hoping to reach Ayodhya by January 13. “The UP chief minister has assured me to keep my sandals inside of the mandir for darshan,” he said.He said the sandals weighed 8kg each when they were initially made with silver. “I have done the ‘Ayodhya Parikrama’ by walking 38km every day carrying them on my head. These sandals have travelled to the UK, Dubai, Malaysia and Singapore,” he said. After gold plating, the sandals will weigh 12.5kg each.Tirupati temple to distribute 1 lakh laddusDevotees participating in the consecration ceremony will be treated with Tirupati laddus, the famous prasadam offered to Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which manages the temple in Andhra Pradesh, has decided to distribute 1 lakh laddus to devotees in Ayodhya.TTD executive officer AV Dharma Reddy said Lord Venkateswara and Lord Rama are the incarnations of Mahavishnu. medium106642018“The entire nation is eagerly awaiting the grand inauguration of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra in Ayodhya on January 22. We will distribute Tirupati laddu prasadam to the devotees there,” he said, adding that the TTD has taken the decision as a “goodwill gesture”.He said each laddu will weigh around 25gm. The TTD is making arrangements to transport the prasadam to Ayodhya by road. The prasadam will be available a day before the consecration ceremony and will have a shelf life of five days. TTD produces about 4 lakh big laddus (175gm each) and 75,000 small laddus (25gm each) daily.Gold plating of doors by Ghaziabad firmAll 18 doors of the sanctum sanctorum on the ground floor — where the idol of Lord Ram is to be placed — will be covered with gold plating. In all, the sanctum sanctorum complex that extends above the ground floor has 46 doors.According to temple officials, a Ghaziabad-based jewellery firm has been given the responsibility of gold plating the doors. The firm has already completed the gold-plating of seven doors and the rest will be done within a fortnight.A layer of copper has already been applied on the doors to hold the gold plating over it. Prakash Gupta, office in-charge of the Sri Ram Janambhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, said these gold-plated doors will be ready soon.Trust member Anil Mishra said that the gold to be used on the doors have been offered by devotees. He said ever since the Supreme Court’s verdict in favour of the Ram temple, “devotees have been donating a large quantity of gold and silver other than cash to Ram Lalla”.Gujarat architect who designed the templeThe Ram temple, designed by renowned Gujarat-based architect Chandrakant Sompura, is built according to the Nagara style of architecture that originated in northern India.In an interview to TOI in 2020, he had said that “the design was among the best that I have made. All the temples that I have designed so far are good, but this one is special”. medium106642197He could not visit Ayodhya at the time because of the pandemic. But his son, Ashish Sompura, was present for the shilanyas ceremony.“People affectionately remember my grandfather Ramji Sompura as the architect of the Somnath temple. For years to come, people will associate my name with the magnificent Ram temple in Ayodhya,” Sompura had said.“Nobody was allowed there at that time [in 1989] and there was strict security. I had measured the dimensions with my feet before designing the temple,” Sompura said.Chandrakant Sompura belongs to a celebrated temple architect family that has been designing temples for 18 generations. The father-son duo of Chandrakant and Ashish have so far designed 131 temples across the country and abroad.Watch: Gujarat architect on the Ram temple project medium nocaption104924133The Somnath and Ambaji temples were designed by Chandrakant’s father Prabhashankar, while his grandfather Ramjibhai designed the temples of Palitana in Gujarat. One of the gates of a Palitana temple is called Ramji Gate.During the consecration ceremony, ‘Khushbu Gujarat Ki’ will waft through Ayodhya. A farmer from Gujarat has prepared a 108ft-long incense stick as an offering to Lord Ram. The huge incense stick is heading towards Ayodhya in a trailer.Temple doors made of Maharashtra teakwoodThe Ram temple will bear the imprint of the dense Dandakaranya forests, where Lord Ram was believed to have spent time during his exile.The entire timber for the temple’s main gate, 118 other wooden gates, idols and animals carved on artefacts has been sourced from the verdant sweep of Allapalli in Gadchiroli district of east Maharashtra, now infamous for Maoists and its booby-trapped hinterland.The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust procured the entire teakwood stock from the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), a state-owned entity engaged in commercial extraction of high-quality timber, for the temple work.Earlier, the FDCM had supplied teakwood for the Central Vista Project in New Delhi and the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai. medium106642333“The Ram temple trust learned about FDCM from the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, which recommended quality teak from erstwhile the Central Provinces, now Vidarbha,” said FDCM managing director Vikas Gupta.According to sources, there were three choices before the trust — teak from Burma, Vidarbha’s Gadchiroli and Kerala’s Nilambur.Gupta said that a team of the temple architects, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE), along with temple trust members visited FDCM’s Ballarshah depot and were satisfied with the quality of teak.“We supplied 3,000 cubic feet of teak costing ₹2.25 crore till now and more is in the pipeline. Transportation was arranged by L&T, which is executing the temple work,” said Gupta.“CP teak is valued because of its durability. It is less susceptible to insect attack due to high oil content. Besides, the wood is strong, beautiful and imbued with the right colour and texture. Easy availability and its large size to enable intricate carvings were other reasons,” he said.Paag, paan and makhana from BiharThe Patna Mahavir Mandir authorities are preparing to carry paag (headgear), paan (betel leaves) and makhana (fox nuts) from Mithila in Bihar for Lord Ram for the consecration ceremony. According to the scriptures, Lord Ram’s wife Sita was from Mithila, known for its paan and superior quality makhana.“Lord Ram is the son-in-law of Mithila. We will be honoured to send him paag, paan and makhana as offering during the consecration ceremony,” said Kishore Kunal, the secretary of the Mahavir Mandir in Patna.According to officials, the gifts from Bihar will be offered to Lord Ram in the run-up to the consecration ceremony on January 22. medium106642343Kunal also said that the Mahavir Mandir authorities will run a community kitchen, Ram Rasoi, in Ayodhya to serve devotees.Earlier, the Mahavir Mandir authorities had announced a contribution of ₹10 crore for the Ram temple construction. An amount of ₹8 crore has already been given and the rest will be handed over on January 15, said Kunal.Rajasthan’s white marble, pink sandstoneMakrana marble and pink sandstone from Rajasthan have been used in the temple’s construction. The pink sandstone measuring 4.7 lakh cubic feet from Rajasthan’s Bharatpur district has been used in the main temple structure and 17,000 granite stones in the plinths, The Indian Express reported.The white Makrana marble has been used in the construction of the temple’s sanctum sanctorum, flooring, arches and railing. medium106642312The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust engaged around 1,200 artisans for carving the stones in Rajasthan and at the workshop run by the trust in Ayodhya to meet the December 2023 deadline for completing the construction of the sanctum sanctorum.Chhattisgarh sends rice for Ram Lalla’s bhogChhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai recently announced that the state has sent trucks loaded with rice for Ram Lalla’s bhog and grand bhandara. The state is well known for its rice varieties. According to reports, the Chhattisgarh Rice Millers Association sent the rice following a request from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust.Assam sends 7,000 bamboo pieces for eventAhead of the consecration ceremony, locals and members of the All Assam Divyanga Versatile Association of the state’s Kamrup district have sent 7,000 pieces of bamboo to Ayodhya.A container truck filled with bamboo pieces collected from the Lampi area near Boko to Ayodhya was dispatched on January 4.Arjun Chetry, a member of the Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council, said that this is a proud moment for them as they were able to send bamboo that will be used in the ceremony.The 7,000 bamboo branches were collected from the Lampi area along the Assam-Meghalaya border. “The bamboo-loaded truck will travel 1,250km to reach Ayodhya.

The women, who have been running Nahri restaurant near Vansda for the last 16 years, are now operating a milk processing plant to make a range of products.They have started selling ice cream, pedas, shrikhand, lassi, curd, paneer and buttermilk made from the plant that has a processing capacity of 100 litres per day (LPD). The project was launched in July with investment of Rs 8.5 lakh and the dairy is run by 10 tribal women in shift duties.“This the the first daily entirely managed by tribal women. At present, they have a processing capacity of 100 LPD which will be expanded to 400 LPD in near future,” said Abhishek Pandey, additional chief programme executive, BAIF Development Research Foundation, a charitable organization that helps families become self-reliant. The project was started after the women got trained in processing. The women, all school dropouts, start their day at around 9am and work till 7pm. “We are working in two shifts at the restaurant and dairy. We make our own dairy products and sell them to buyers who visit our store,” said Dipali Mahadi, secretary of Annapurna Nahri Bhojanalaya (ANB). The women’s group has installed a milk warmer to prepare material for curd, peda and shrikhand. They are preparing to install other machinery to expand their capacity. The project is sponsored by Larsen & Toubro Public Charitable Trust with Teplu Learning Pvt Ltd as the technical partner and BAIF. “The team of women work in two shifts and we are in the initial stage of setting up business. Tribals have got a new opportunity of earning through this initiative,” said Sita Gavli, president of ANB. In 2006, the first Nahri restaurant of tribal food was launched in 2006 at Gangpur village near Vansda.

Defence achievements will provide wide spin-off benefits to the Indian economy, technologies developed in the field are equally useful for civilian purposes,” Rajnath said.Major HighlightsWhile the show will see multiple aircraft perform various manouvres, the DRDO’s UAV Tapas-BH — Tactical Aerial Platform for Advanced Surveillance (Tapas) Beyond Horizon (BH) — making its debut is a significant development showcasing indigenous capability. DRDO will showcase a total of 330 products and technologies to the world through Aero India.The major foreign and Indian exhibitors include Airbus, Boeing, Dassault Aviation, Lockheed Martin, Israel Aerospace Industry, BrahMos Aerospace, Army Aviation, HC Robotics, SAAB, Safran, Rolls Royce, Larsen & Toubro, Bharat Forge, HAL, BEL, Bharat Dynamics and BEML.More than 100 aircraft — 67 flying and 36 static display planes — including LCA Tejas, F16 Viper, F/A 18 Super Hornet, Su-30, Rafale among the fighters, a host of HAL helicopters such as the LCH, LUH will also enthral audiences.Runway To A Billion OpportunitiesAccording to Singh, the show will introduce the potential, opportunities and possibilities of ‘New India’ to the world. “There will be an exhibition of indigenous defence products, in which established business organisations and start-ups will demonstrate their products.

Structures that already have many cracks and a weak foundation will be in the heavy category. They will undergo repairs; the foundations will be strengthened by injecting chemical-mix grout material. ""In phase-1 too, a church near High Court, which did not have any foundation, developed cracks during tunnelling and we had to do heavy repair work.

The $2.2 billion incentive aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen by a fifth over the next five years, said a senior government official and an industry manager working in renewable energy. It would do this in part by increasing the scale of the industry, they said. The current cost in India is 300 rupees to 400 rupees per kg, said the manager. The United States and the European Union have already approved incentives worth billions of dollars for green hydrogen projects. Hydrogen can be used as a fuel. It is made by splitting water with an electrical process, electrolysis. If the devices that do that, electrolysers, are powered by renewable energy, the product is called green hydrogen, a fuel free of greenhouse emissions. The Indian aid could be announced in the Feb. 1 budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1, said the government official. All sources declined to be named discussing a budget proposal. The ministries of renewable energy and finance did not respond to queries sent by Reuters.Companies such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, NTPC, Adani Enterprises , JSW Energy and Acme Solar have big plans on green hydrogen. Adani, led by the world's third-richest person, Gautam Adani, said in June that it and France's TotalEnergies would jointly create the ""world's largest green hydrogen ecosystem"". The government expects industry to invest 8 trillion rupees in green hydrogen and its derivative green ammonia by 2030, said the industry manager and another government official. Green ammonia is made by combining nitrogen with hydrogen using renewable energy sources; it can be used by the fertiliser industry or as a fuel or convenient means of transporting hydrogen. The green hydrogen proposal is likely to be called ""Strategic Intervention for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT)"" and will be split into 45 billion rupees for electrolyser manufacturing for five years and the 135 billion rupees for green hydrogen and green ammonia production for three years, the manager and second official said. The incentive for making green hydrogen is likely to be 50 rupees per kg for three years, they said. India aims to sell 70% of the production to countries such as South Korea, Japan and in the European Union, an industry official said, adding that derivatives, including green ammonia, had an equally strong demand. The government is estimating global demand for green hydrogen will exceed 100 million tonnes by 2030, from just under 75 million tonnes now, according to other industry sources. In February the government announced plans for India to make 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030, a figure that the first government official said could be doubled, depending on international demand. The government also plans for the country to achieve electrolyser manufacturing capacity of 15 gigawatts in phases by 2030. That would be almost 10 times current global capacity. US-based Ohmium International has commissioned India's first green-hydrogen factory in Bengaluru. Reliance Industries , Larsen & Toubro, Greenko and H2e Power last year announced plans to build gigawatt-scale factories.

The entire process of placing these lines is aimed at providing a power sub-station in Meerut, to cater to the power needs of the adjoining areas in the coming days.The project work started in January 2020 and since then, several cases of thefts were reported in many areas that fall under the project jurisdiction. These places included Meerut, Hapur and Ghaziabad.“In Hapur, police promptly traced the thieves and no theft had taken place there since. However, police in Meerut are yet to take any action which has emboldened these thieves,” said an official involved in the project.Divulging details of the incident, Vijay Pandey, assistant manager (administration), L&T, told TOI, ""Theft occurred at two towers placed on farmlands on June 14. The area falls under Meerut’s Kharkhoda police station limits. Thieves took away equipment worth Rs 40 lakh. Now, work has been delayed till August-September.""Meanwhile, dismissing claims of ""police inaction"", SP (rural) Keshav Kumar said that in most cases, such thefts are results of ""connivance between company workers and thieves"".

There are now s","Mumbai: Long breaks no longer mean a full stop for a person’s career. A 10-year break taken by HR professional Shilpi Singh did not pose a hurdle in rekindling her career aspirations. Six months ago, Shilpi joined Airtel through the company’s return-to-work programme ‘Step-In’. Several companies now have second-career programmes — a window of opportunity for women who may have left their careers due to various reasons, such as childcare. Still, most organisations do not encourage candidates with a break that’s longer than a couple of years. There’s usually a cap on the quantum of break taken, based on the belief that people’s skills would become outdated. But that’s not the case with Airtel’s Step-In. Shilpi, who pursued her interests and became a certified instructor for Zumba and Yoga, among many other accomplishments, is now part of the HR team at Airtel’s Bengaluru office where she drives talent acquisition across HR and other verticals. Airtel said Shilpi’s diverse experience brings a refreshing perspective to the company and has identified her easy connect with candidates as being critical to her role. Airtel chief people officer Amrita Padda said, “Breaks enrich us in many ways. People may have taken a break from an active corporate career, but they gain experience during this phase by doing something meaningful elsewhere. Being out of the corporate world doesn’t mean that you’re not active. In fact, the way Shilpi has come back into the team, the insights she’s bringing to us and the conversations that she’s having internally & externally — it is really impressive.”Padda said Airtel’s goal is clear. “We want to stay true to our vision of being an inclusive workplace where we can bring in a lot of diverse employees. The Step-In programme is about bringing back women who have taken a career break for various reasons but have the right experience and skills to return to work.”The ‘Renew’ programme at Larsen & Toubro (L&T) only considers qualifications of a returnee woman candidate and not the length of her career gap. Executive VP & head (corporate HR) C Jayakumar said, “We recently hired a woman employee who was on a career break that extended to around 10 years. We hired her because she’s a qualified MBA and is suitable for the post. All that we ensure is that we sensitise the candidates coming back to work after a long break that they are being hired for their past experience and their current potential for the job requirement.” In the last one year, approximately 2,000 candidates applied through Renew. Marico, which recently launched ‘Phoenix’, a gender-neutral second-career programme, also does not have a cap on the break a candidate took. Marico’s CHRO Amit Prakash said, “We believe grey cells matter more than grey hair. We are always open to hiring talent who believe in making a difference and leaving an impact. We are offering an opportunity to professionals who have taken a minimum 1-year break from the workforce to re-enter on a project or on a lateral hiring basis. The programme respects individuality and welcomes candidates that may have taken longer breaks. The idea is to not limit ourselves with the number of years of break, but create a more thought-diverse workplace driven by the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit that Marico is known for. Therefore, the qualifications, capabilities and expertise of the candidate will matter and not the years of break.”As second-career policies get further fine-tuned to make them more progressive, Marico decided to make Phoenix a gender-neutral programme given the paradigm shift in employee expectations.

LT,2023-06-18T15:37:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Population boom spurs hunt for stock market winners in India,"India Business News: Thronged by hundreds of people, including some Bollywood celebrities, Tim Cook’s excitement was palpable as the chief executive officer of Apple Inc.","Thronged by hundreds of people, including some Bollywood celebrities, Tim Cook’s excitement was palpable as the chief executive officer of Apple Inc. officially opened its first company-owned store in India in April.India is at a “tipping point,” he went on to say on a call with analysts after his visit. It was that same month when India also earned a new title as the world’s most populous nation, burnishing the appeal of sectors that cater to a burgeoning middle class and young consumers.The milestone serves as a reminder of the growth potential for India’s $3.4 trillion stock market — which recently reclaimed its spot as the world’s fifth largest — as the South Asian economy takes a bigger pie in global manufacturing and consumption, currently dominated by China. With two-thirds of India’s 1.4 billion population in the working age, its “vibrancy” and “dynamism” — two attributes Cook used to describe the market — contrast with many Asian peers grappling with shrinking populations.101083858Home to more than 5,000 listed companies, India offers global investors a wide range of options. Consumption, financial services, infrastructure, digitalization and health care are among sectors seen benefiting the most in the coming years from the demographic composition.“The great thing about India is that with 1.4 billion people, you can go into any industry, there’s a market domestically,” Mark Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners, said at an event in Hong Kong on Friday. When asked about what he likes in India, the veteran emerging-markets investor mentioned infrastructure — companies that do building materials, health care and Internet-related businesses like mapping companies.Heated tensions between China and the West are also providing a tailwind as India is seen as an alternative by many global firms seeking to diversify their geographic footprints. Micron Technology Inc. is said to be close to an agreement to commit at least $1 billion toward setting up a semiconductor packaging factory in the nation, Bloomberg News reported on Friday. That report follows a Chinese ban on the use of Micron chips earlier this year.101083862India’s promising prospects aside, much will rest on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government — which is expected to win another term in 2024 — and future governments, to ensure this demographic dividend can materialize into economic benefits.Building fast and adequate infrastructure, lifting education standards and creating jobs for millions of people entering the market every year will be no easy task, especially as the nation wrestles with widespread red tape and corruption. Problems like poverty and malnutrition continue to linger and social tensions can boil over if inequality widens. And India has its own set of geopolitical worries as tensions with neighboring China and Pakistan persist.Yet with the right policy mix, the process of economic transformation should by itself create some stock-market winners. Here is a look at some of the key themes that investors highlighted:ConsumptionWith a median age of just 28 versus 38 in China, India is forecast to become the world’s largest “young consumer market” by 2030, according to the Brookings Institution. A rapid rise in disposable incomes is seen boosting demand for everything from vehicles to mobile phones and luxury items.Ken Peng, head of Asia Pacific investment strategy at Citi Global Wealth Investments, said the upgrade to luxury items and home improvement from basic necessities will be among the “big trends” that he wants to capture. Stocks that may benefit include car manufacturers like Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. and Tata Motors Ltd. and jewelery maker including Titan Co. Staples producers such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd. will remain a focus as they can sell higher-margin products.India’s ambition of becoming a manufacturing hub is gaining more traction as global firms see geopolitical and regulatory risks when investing in China. Tesla Inc. officials visited India in May and discussed the possible local sourcing of components and incentives, eventually looking to establish a domestic factory, according to a Bloomberg News report.China’s “factory story is fading away. And I think that’s probably going to India and Asean to a large extent,” said Evelyn Yeo, head of Asia investments at Pictet Wealth Management. Yeo, however, warned that the biggest issue with India is the lack of infrastructure and supply chain completeness.Companies like ABB India Ltd., Siemens Ltd., Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and several state-run enterprises are seen as beneficiaries amid Modi’s push to upgrade infrastructure.Financial servicesInvestors see promising returns in India’s financial industry as a ballooning middle class and more workers translate into increased financialization of household savings. Managed investments, which include mutual funds, life insurance and retirement funds can reach 315 trillion rupees ($3.8 trillion) by 2027 from 135 trillion rupees as of March last year, according to rating firm Crisil Ltd. Top lenders ICICI Bank Ltd., HDFC Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India are seen to have the potential to grow further. Shadow lender Bajaj Finance Ltd. and insurers such as Life Insurance Corp of India and HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd. will continue to receive the spotlight as the financial industry matures.101083871 India’s aspiring tech firms are competing with global rivals. The listing of several startups since 2021 has given overseas investors an opportunity to participate in the country’s digital story. But as the pandemic tech boom cooled along with higher interest rests, many including Paytm, Zomato Ltd. and Nykaa currently trade at significant loss from their post-listing highs. But the emergence of a new cohort of digital shoppers is seen as promising. “In the last two to three years, along with Millennials and Boomers, more shoppers have emerged,” Sachin Salgaonkar of BofA Securities wrote in a note last month. While many of India’s Boomers have gone back to the pre-pandemic habit of shopping offline, the country’s “Generation Z” — those born after 1996 — and women over the age of 40 years in smaller towns are providing fresh impetus to digital commerce, Salgaonkar wrote.Healthcare While the ratio of India’s elderly population — those above 60 years of age — currently stands at just above 10% according to the United Nations data, the cohort is projected to grow fast as life expectancy extends. That points to a substantial rise in health care demand. ICICI Securities Ltd. expects earnings of hospital companies to rise more than 17% over the next three years, aided by higher count of specialty surgeries and additional beds.Hospital chain owners like Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd., Fortis Healthcare Ltd. and HealthCare Global Enterprises Ltd. are among those seen benefiting from increased demand. Drug makers such as Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Cipla Ltd. and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. are also potential winners.

The company also performed operation and maintenance of 3 lakh smart meters for Lucknow electricity supply administration (LESA) around a year back.According to FIR, IPS firm project manager Jai Bhagwan Pal identified accused Prashant Gupta as its former electrician, who hadn’t submitted his ID card.Speaking to TOI, Jai Bhagwan Pal said, “The equipment recovered from Prashant and Deepak does not belong to the company. Prashant used to work as electrician in IPS firm and had left the company a year ago after the company service for meter installation in the city was completed, however he hadn’t submitted the ID card. His aide Deepak has no connection with the IPS firm.”LESA Trans Gomti chief executive engineer, Anil Kumar Tiwari said, “Tampering electric meter is a serious offense and it causes losses to discom.

The London-headquartered bank, which reported pre-tax profits of $18.9 billion for 2021, said that $1,110 million came out of Indian operations. Pre-tax profits from Indian operations were 8% higher than $1,024 million in 2020.

Global banking and markets business was the largest contributor to net profit at $593 million — unchanged from last year. The bank’s lending profits grew due to an increase in the size of its loan book. Corporate loan book grew at a compounded rate of 16% in the last five years led by a tripling in loans to SMEs.

A bridge of this sort is built using the main elements of the box girder technique and cable-stayed towers. Compared with a purely cable-stayed bridge, such as the Signature Bridge, an extradosed bridge has much shorter stay-towers.94210083PWD said that the extradosed technique was chosen because of the long span between the supporting pillars of the bridge. The bridge has the second longest span for a bridge in Delhi and the bridge deck is 545 metres in length.“The span between the four piers is 127 metres each, this being the second largest span in the city after the Signature Bridge,” said a PWD officer. “This was done in anticipation that in future if there is a plan to make a waterway on the river, then there should be enough room and the bridge should not come in the way.”According to the officials, whenever the distance between the pillars is long to medium length, there arises the need to stabilise the bridge. Since the pillars can’t themselves hold the girders, an ‘extra dose’ of strength is given to the structure with boxed girders.India's first extradosed bridge was Nivedita Setu over the Hooghly in Kolkata, West Bengal. Measuring 880 metres in length and connecting Howrah with Kolkata, the bridge was constructed by Larsen and Toubro Limited, the same company that has been engaged for the construction of the Barapullah Phase III bridge.Working in the Yamuna has been challenging. Last year, one of the pillars meant to support the bridge tilted due to the strong flow of the river. PWD is taking care to prevent a recurrence. It is making a ‘well foundation’ on the riverbed to give strong support to the pillars. The pillars are 50 metres deep in the river, going past the riverbed and the ‘wells’ are around 14 metres in diameter, under which circular pads of concrete have been placed in several layers.The remaining two pillars, which are on the ground, have a span of 82 metres. The bridge is approximately 11 metres from the ground. The flow force of the Yamuna at the spots where two pillars have been erected has been estimated and the piers have been built to bear the tilt pressure. PWD is going down to a depth of up to 50 metres to construct the base of the pillars.As a safety measure, the cables on the bridge are connected to stress sensors on the towers holding the German-made cables. The sensors will send alerts to the authorities about the stress levels on the deck of the bridge.“The extradosed technique is being used in certain parts of India to makes the bridge deck rigid and strengthen it, unlike the flexibility in the bridge deck of cable-stayed bridges,” said Lakshmy Parameswaran, former chief scientist at Central Road Research Institute and a bridge expert. “The bridge also becomes more economical and safer. Currently, the government has its own guidelines regarding the use of the extradosed method in bridge construction.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delayed-but-barapullah-iii-bridge-to-give-city-a-first/articleshow/94208763.cms

LT,2022-09-12T16:37:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Return of pricing power to keep retail prices elevated,"India Business News: Data due later Monday will probably show retail inflation quickened to 6.9% last month from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey of economi","NEW DELHI: Indian consumers expecting retail inflation to cool in tandem with easing wholesale prices are in for disappointment.That’s because the consumer price index, currently hovering above the central bank’s 2%-6% target band, has shown little correlation with the wholesale measure in the past decade. And if historical trends are any indication, the two indexes have had an inverse relationship for the most part of that period, which analysts attribute to the pricing power of most businesses.Data due later Monday will probably show retail inflation quickened to 6.9% last month from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists as of Sept. 10. That compares with estimates for wholesale price inflation easing for a third straight month to 12.9%, in numbers scheduled for release Wednesday.With wholesale prices galloping in double-digits since April last year, companies found themselves in a fix -- raise prices too much and hurt a nascent recovery in demand or absorb costs and take a hit to profitability. While many consumer-goods makers including Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and ITC Ltd. and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. raised prices during the period, the increases were probably not enough to cover elevated costs. Maruti, Tata Motors Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. reported a hit on their income in the April-June quarter due to high input costs and supply chain constraints.As the gap between WPI and CPI narrows, firms will be reluctant to pass on the benefits of falling global commodity prices to retail consumers because they will likely look to recoup their margins, said Rahul Bajoria, an economist with Barclays Bank Plc.

The RBI, which has returned borrowing costs to pre-pandemic levels with 140 basis points of hikes since May, expects inflation to average 6.7% in the year to March.Sticky inflationAs the wholesale price index falls, “lower input costs will be used by firms to offset the ongoing margin squeeze, thereby keeping CPI inflation sticky,” said Sonal Varma, an economist with Nomura Holdings Inc., who expects the headline print to remain above 6% until February.Global commodities prices are seeing a moderation amid fears of a slowdown caused by a US Federal Reserve-led monetary policy tightening. As a result, wholesale inflation is seen easing to less than 5% in the next one year, falling below consumer prices gains for the first time in more than two years, according to a Bloomberg survey.There is a risk that the pass-through of past increases in input costs could continue, partly offsetting the favorable impact of recent fall in commodity prices, rate-setter Rajiv Ranjan said in the minutes of RBI’s latest policy meet.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/return-of-pricing-power-to-keep-retail-prices-elevated/articleshow/94152851.cms

The Supreme Court has granted a stay and we cannot go against the court order. The matters have been transferred to the Bombay high court and we are complying with all that involves nine departments.

But whenever we have seen large deals, I couldn’t get a seat on the table. With the combined entity, I am very confident I should be able to participate in them, be able to build hyperscaler partnerships,” he told TOI in an interaction on Thursday.In May, Mindtree and LTI boards of directors approved the merger of the two independently listed IT services companies under the Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Group, creating a $3.5 billion powerhouse. The merged entity, called LTIMindtree, will be the sixth largest IT services firm in India by revenue. The combined entity is expected to leverage complementary strengths, unlocking synergies through scale, cross-vertical expertise and talent pool. He said a steering committee has been formed post-merger to address retention benefits for key leaders, incentives and earnouts. Mindtree’s revenue in the June quarter rose 4% sequentially and 28.6% year-on-year to $399.3 million. Its sequential revenue growth was 5.5% in constant currency. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of more than 5% revenue growth in constant currency and came on the back of a healthy demand for digital capabilities. “Barring the client-specific softness in RCM (retail, CPG & manufacturing), all the verticals have done well, including travel and hospitality, which has reached pre-pandemic levels,” he said. The BFSI sector registered its fifth consecutive quarter of 5% growth.In RCM, Chatterjee said there were project ramp downs as some clients had exposure to Ukraine and Russia as markets, and because of supply chain issues on account of lockdowns in China. “The worst is over for RCM,” he added.Asked about recessionary concerns and the impact on client spending, he said in his conversation with clients, barring a few instances, he hasn’t come across clients holding back or changing their spending plan. “I’m confident the profitable growth story will continue into the first half of the year. We will keep on observing how things are shaping up. Most clients are well into their transformation journey, and they are not done with it. Every client is at a different phase of their journey. Our belief is that this may be an opportunity for clients to try focusing on discretionary spends. They may again focus on how they take cost out, and by taking cost out, they might be able to fund the transformation underway,” he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ltimindtree-will-be-able-to-bid-for-big-deals/articleshow/92888239.cms

Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) recently awarded the contract to Larsen & Toubro to construct the elevated section with 10 stations within a period of 36 months. The contract to construct the remaining portion on OMR from Sholinganallur to Siruseri SIPCOT covering 10km is yet to be awarded. The 118.9km phase-2 is expected to be ready by 2025. Officials said the contract awarded last week for the Nehru Nagar-Sholinganallur line includes building an elevated viaduct from a ramp south of Taramani Link Road up to Sholinganallur which is an interchange station. It also includes construction of 10 elevated stations at Nehru Nagar, Kandanchavadi, Perungudi, Thoraipakkam, Mettukuppam, PTC Colony, Okkiyampet, Karapakkam, Okkiyam Thoraipakkam and Sholinganallur. ""We have divided the corridors across phase-2 into smaller sections and are awarding contracts to complete construction faster. Therefore, if there arises an issue in one section, it won't affect the other lines of phase-2,"" an official said. The OMR line is part of the 45.8km corridor-3 from Madhavaram to Siruseri SIPCOT. Earlier, CMRL cancelled the tenders floated for the OMR line as the corridor was redesigned. The elevated viaducts was initially planned on level two with the elevated IT expressway below.However, in a step to cut costs, CMRL redesigned the plan to build the elevated metro line on level one through the centre of the road on OMR with the expressway road on either side of the metro viaducts. After the redesign, tenders were floated again. When the OMR line opens, commuters from the north, west and southern suburbs can reach the IT hub without the hassle of waiting in long signals and wading through busy road traffic during peak hours.Sholinganallur, which is an interchange linking corridor-3 and 5, and Alandur, which is part of corridor-5 and has an intersection with existing phase-1 station, will be the stations to switch corridors for OMR residents to reach transport hubs like the airport, Central and Egmore station and CMBT bus terminus or arterial roads like Anna Salai and Poonamallee High Road.OMR residents could take a direct train to Madhavaram, switch corridors at Thirumayilai to reach the shopping hub at T Nagar, and switch lines at Sholinganallur to reach the IT hub at Porur.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennai-metro-work-on-it-corridor-to-begin-soon/articleshow/91977838.cms

A follow-up launch of another 36 satellites is expected next year.The OneWeb contract for ISRO is learnt to be an outcome of some aggressive bidding by the Indians after the Ukraine conflict knocked off the Russian space launch capabilities off the market.Chaitanya Giri, space consultant with Research and Information System for Developing Countries likens the aggression in the Indian space sector to the one displayed by Sourav Ganguly's cricket team.""Our earlier approach was like Mohammad Azharuddin-led cricket team - very mellow and gentlemanly. The new found aggression is because of India's rising geopolitical stature. Also, the Russian market has become a no go due to the Ukraine conflict. So is the Chinese market. Now, it is Advantage India,"" Giri told PTI.He said Indian start-ups should also vie for international contracts and not look at ISRO for business.""ISRO is not an entity that will sustain business for them. Indian space start-ups, MSMEs and big corporates will have to strike business arrangements amongst each other. These B-2-B arrangements need to grow,"" Giri said.

Individuals with income up to 700,000 rupees won’t have to pay tax under the new inc","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government delivered India’s annual budget on Wednesday that laid out a slew of measures to bolster infrastructure for creating more jobs and attract investment ahead of next year’s crucial national election.With a year to go for the Lok Sabha polls, it’s crucial for Modi to tackle the issues of high unemployment and inflation as he seeks to win a third consecutive term. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman focused on farmers, so-called backward castes and women to deal with the inequities exacerbated by the pandemic.The government increased capital spending 33% to 10 trillion rupees ($122 billion) that will enable the country to expand its network of roads, ports and airports and make it an attractive destination for investors.WinnersTaxpayersAs expected, Modi’s administration gave some relief to taxpayers. Individuals with income up to 700,000 rupees won’t have to pay tax under the new income tax regime. The number of tax slabs were reduced, while the maximum tax rate was cut to 39%. This will leave more money with the middle class that can also boost consumption demand.AgricultureThe government has increased spending in the farm sector, which accounts for about 19% of the economy. The budget proposes to spend 22 billion rupees ($269 million) on high-value horticulture and set up an agriculture accelerator fund to finance farm startups. This will benefit companies such as Kaveri Seed Co, Dhanuka Agritech Ltd, Bombay Super Hybrid Seeds, Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd.TourismTo capture the surge in travel demand, India will select 50 destinations to promote domestic tourism. It will also develop an app to guide tourists on food streets, security, physical and virtual connectivity to lift their experience. Ticketing companies and hotels such as Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp, Thomas Cook India Ltd, Indian Hotels and EIH Ltd will be the beneficiaries.InfrastructureCrucial to boosting last-mile connectivity, India has decided to build 50 additional airports, heliports and aerodromes and identified 100 fresh projects. Railways will benefit from a record capital outlay of 2.4 trillion rupees. This is a win for airport operators such as Adani Airport Holdings Ltd, GMR Airports Infrastructure Ltd, GVK Airport Developers Ltd, and construction companies like Larsen & Toubro Ltd and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. Metal/CementHigher capital expenditure and investments for housing, infrastructure, railways announced in the budget are positive for steel mills and cement makers. Key gainers include Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd, Jindal Steel & Power Ltd.Electric VehiclesIndia plans to provide impetus to green mobility by exempting from customs duty on import of capital goods required to manufacture lithium-ion cells used in electric vehicle batteries. This will be a boost for battery makers such as Exide Industries Ltd and Amara Raja Batteries Ltd and automakers like Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.Green EnergyThe budget provided 350 billion-rupee investment in energy transition and carbon neutrality initiatives. The government will provide financial support to battery energy storage systems with capacity of 4,000 megawatt hour.LOSERSDefenceThe budget lacked impetus for defence manufacturing, said Gaurav Mehndiratta, partner and head of aerospace and defence at KPMG. Military budget got a paltry increase of 7%, compared with a 33% increase in the nation’s overall capital expenditure, he said. That’s a surprise given the rising tensions between India and China. State-run firms Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd, which have benefited from India’s local manufacturing push, were key decliners, falling more than 6% each.Cigarette MakersShares of ITC Ltd and Godfrey Phillips India plunged in early Mumbai trading after India increased a tax, effective Feb. 2, on specified cigarettes by about 16%.JewelersJewelry stocks dropped after the government left the import taxes on gold unchanged despite demand from the bullion industry to reverse the hike announced in July. The government also increased the import tax on silver. A higher tax increases the cost for consumers as the country imports almost all the bullion it consumes. The benchmark gold futures in Mumbai rose as much as 1.3% to an all-time high of 57,950 rupees per 10 grams. Key losers would be Kalyan Jewellers India Ltd, Titan Co and PC Jeweller Ltd.Oil RefinersIndian state-run refiners Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp are likely losers as the government didn’t announce any compensation toward losses on keeping a check on diesel and gasoline prices. There have been demands from the companies and the oil ministry to partly cover the losses via a budgetary support.Foreign CarmakersImported automobiles, including electric vehicles, will attract higher levies. The customs duty on cars and EVs priced above $40,000 imported in completely-built units were increased to 70% from 60%. Foreign carmakers like BYD Co and Mercedes Benz that rely on imported cars to serve Indian market will face challenges.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/winners-and-losers-from-union-budget-2023/articleshow/97524372.cms

In a bid to encourage private sector participation in the space sector, New Space India Limited (NSIL), a company under the Department of Space, had invited proposals from the Indian industry to build five PSLVs. Minister of State in the PMO Jitendra Singh said two consortia, one comprising Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Larsen & Toubro, and another involving Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) and Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML), have submitted techno-commercial proposals for building PSLV. State-run Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited too has submitted a techno-commercial proposal for ""end-to-end realisation"" of PSLV, he told the Rajya Sabha in response to a question by NCP member Vandana Chavan. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had been working closely with the industry in building launch vehicles, satellites and other components, but it was for the first time in 2020 that the government opened up the sector for private participation for the entire spectrum of space operations, including planetary exploration missions. The Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) acts as the agency to promote, handhold and authorise private sector activities in the sector, besides enabling sharing of technical facilities and expertise from ISRO. NSIL has the mandate to scale up private participation in the space programme and also own and operate capital-intensive assets such as satellites and launch vehicles. Singh told Rajya Sabha that since 2020, there have been 48 applications from private players received to IN-SPACe for undertaking space activities and their applications are being processed for further action. ""Out of these, the applications with respect to authorizing the space activities to non-government private entities are 16, sharing of technology and facilities of Department of Space to NGPEs are 23 and Consultancy and Promotion are 9,"" he said in a written response.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adani-lt-among-firms-keen-to-build-satellite-launchers-govt/articleshow/90420767.cms

Officials said the outer walls of the station will be built first ahead of the tunneling, which may commence later this year. Traffic has been diverted to make way for the construction on OMR. Similarly, construction of the outer walls of Greenways Road Metro has already begun under the corporation playground at RA Puram. Both Thiruvanmiyur and Greenways Road metro stations are part of the 45.8km corridor from Madhavaram to Siruseri SIPCOT.An official at the construction site on OMR said identification and shifting of underground utilities like electric cables, water and sewage pipes is in the final stages to make way for the construction of the outer walls of Thiruvanmiyur metro station. “The construction of the walls will begin next week,” the official said. “Greenways Road Metro station walls are being built at around 21m depth,” the official said. Thiruvanmiyur station will be the first station on OMR before the line proceeds towards the IT corridor and changes into an elevated section from Nehru Nagar to Siruseri SIPCOT. Officials said as the outer walls of the stations are nearing completion, tunnelling will begin.In May 2021, Larsen & Toubro was awarded the contract to build twin tunnels covering 12km from Kellys Station to Taramani Road junction station in 3.5 years. They will also construct diaphragm walls of station box and entry/exit structures of Chetpet metro, Royapettah government Hospital, Thiruvanmiyur metro and part diaphragm wall of Greenways Road metro station.Ahead of the construction, changes have been made to traffic movement in January where traffic from Madhya Kailash to Sholinganallur was allowed on the newly constructed two lane. The traffic in the opposite direction was also allowed on two lanes, which included the service road that was converted into a lane.

The company has been awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract by Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), the special purpose vehicle of the airport’s concessionaire Zurich AG.The two other companies in the fray were infrastructure giants Larsen & Toubro and Shapoorji Pallonji. For the first phase, which has an October 2024 commissioning target, Tata Projects will construct the terminal building, runway, airside infrastructure, roads, utilities, landside facilities and other ancillary buildings. Construction work will begin this month.Following the groundbreaking ceremony by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2021, preparations for the EPC phase of the airport had been initiated with earthwork and the boundary wall construction at the site. So far, the boundary wall coverage has reached about 12 km, with another 5km to go, officials said.YIAPL CEO Christoph Schnellmann said in a statement, “With the award of this EPC contract, our project enters the next phase, which will witness a rapid increase in the pace of construction activities on site. Together with Tata Projects, we’re working to deliver a passenger terminal, runway, and other airport infrastructure with a capacity of 12 million passengers annually, by 2024. Noida International Airport will bolster employment generation and economic growth in the state as well as the country.”Vinayak Pai, CEO and MD designate, TPL, said, “Tata Projects will work closely with YIAPL to deliver India’s most advanced and environment-friendly airport on time. We shall deploy the latest technologies in its construction while meeting the highest standards of quality, safety and sustainability.”TPL has built the new Prayagraj airport terminal. Its other key projects include the new Parliament building, the Mumbai trans-harbour link, stretches of the Dedicated Freight Corridor and metro railway corridors in various cities. The runway for NIA has been approved for Code E status that will allow long-range, wide-bodied aircraft to take off from the strip. The terminal building will have three floors with the top two levels meant for arrival and departure, officials said.The 4km-long and 45 metres wide runway will be equipped with CAT I, II and III instrument landing systems to allow aircraft to land in low visibility conditions. According to YIAPL officials, NIA will be India’s first net-zero emissions airport. Its central design is local, with the flights of steps at the terminal forecourt modelled on the ghats of Varanasi and Haridwar. Schnellman had earlier told TOI the region’s havelis and temples architecture have inspired the design of the terminal building. The roof will be white, translucent and wavy, designed to look like a flowing river.

But electric vehicles (EVs) currently make up a fraction of total sales in the country mainly due to their high price as batteries are imported.The South Asian country wants electric cars to make up 30% of private car sales by 2030 and for electric motorcycles and scooters to make up 40% of such sales, driving demand for batteries which currently contribute about 35% to 40% of the total vehicle cost.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-hyundai-mahindra-bid-for-incentives-under-govts-2-4-billion-battery-scheme/articleshow/88905079.cms

Geology is a multidisciplinary field which consists of sub-disciplines and sections such as geoinformatics, mineralogy, petrology, astrogeology, stratigraphy, hydrogeology, sedimentlogy, seismology, volcanology, geomorphology, crystallography, gemmology, oceanography, geophysics, geochemistry, and economic geology. Geology plays a unique and essential role in today's rapidly changing world. Today, we live in a time when the Earth and its inhabitants face many challenges. Our climate is changing, and that change is being caused by human activity. Earth scientists recognized this problem and will play a key role in efforts to resolve it. They work to develop new sources of energy that will have minimal impact on climate; locate new sources of metals and other mineral resources as known sources are depleted determine how Earth's increasing population can live and avoid serious threats such as volcanic activity, earthquakes, landslides, floods and more.Job opportunities in geologyThe field of geology provides vast job opportunities in both public and private sectors. Union Public Service Commission, State Public Service Commissions, Public Sector Undertakings, Multinational Companies and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Laboratories conduct their own national/state level examination/interviews to recruit freshers.

The infrastructure-to-IT services conglomerate has reduced the number of business verticals to seven from nine, kicking off a fresh round of restructuring. L&T had carved its diversified businesses into nine independent verticals 11 years ago. In the latest scheme of things, Subrahmanyan has brought the hydrocarbon and power businesses involved in EPC/turnkey solutions under the newly created energy vertical. Similarly, he has merged the heavy engineering and defence engineering businesses to form the hi-tech manufacturing segment. Subrahmanyan has also brought the e-commerce/digital platforms and data centres (earlier reported under the “others” segment) under the ambit of IT & technology services — the biggest money spinner for L&T. The IT and tech vertical already includes the company’s three listed subsidiaries — L&T Infotech, L&T Technology Services and Mindtree. The other four verticals are infrastructure (the biggest revenue contributor and the second biggest profit generator for L&T), financial services, development projects and others (which includes realty, manufacture & sale of rubber processing machinery & industrial valves, and military communication projects). L&T said it reorganised its segments effective April 1 of this year in alignment with its strategic plan to achieve a turnover of Rs 2.7 lakh crore by fiscal 2026 and scale up new businesses, which have high growth potential such as green EPC, data centres, electrolysers and digital platforms. The company, which employs nearly 2 lakh people in its IT units and 2.9 lakh labourers at any point of time at its construction sites, had a turnover of Rs 1.6 lakh crore in fiscal 2022. On Tuesday, L&T said its Q1FY23 revenue increased 22% to Rs 35,853 crore, while profit rose 45% to Rs 2,228 crore.“The regrouping would help L&T streamline and simplify its business segments,” said Sharekhan by BNP Paribas assistant VP Khadija Mantri. “Clubbing the inter-linked segments like hydropower & power or IT, e-commerce & digital platform businesses would help the company pursue opportunities in each of these segments in a more constructive manner.”L&T CFO Shankar Raman said that considering the transformation sweeping the energy sector, the company decided to create a new vertical that will house both the existing hydrocarbon and power businesses. “As the world embraces green energy, the green EPC projects the company will bid for will also be part of this new energy vertical.”Raman further said the company combined heavy engineering and defence engineering under hi-tech manufacturing to leverage on the design and manufacturing competencies when they are packed together. “Going forward, the manufacturing of green energy equipment like hydrogen electrolysers will also be brought under hi-tech manufacturing.” Raman also said that since the company anticipates the newly launched digital platforms and recently commissioned data centres businesses to generate revenues, which will be worth reporting, it has decided to bring the two under the IT and tech services vertical.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/lt-cuts-business-verticals-to-7-from-9-reduces-costs/articleshow/93146972.cms

""I have been in public life for over two decades. I challenge them to dig out a single week when I did not launch a developmental project,"" he said.He dedicated the Rs 586 crore Astol regional water supply scheme, an engineering marvel that aims to end the water woes of 174 villages of Dharampur and Kaprada talukas, in tribal-dominated Valsad, by lifting water from the Madhuban Dam to a height of over 1,800 feet (equivalent to a 200-storey building). A network of pipelines has been constructed that criss-crosses the hills in this difficult terrain. The project was announced by Modi during his visit to Navsari in 2018.""In 2018 when I announced this project, critics had claimed that we were doing it with an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha election… We lifted water and took it to the top of the hill. Who would do such hard work for only 200-300 votes? We undertook this project to ease people’s problems, and not due to elections,"" he said.BJP’s tribal outreach here witnessed the participation of nearly five lakh people, which Modi said was a moment of pride for him as he had not received such a rousing reception in the region even when he was CM.Modi said there were a large number of students in this tribal region who excelled in academics but there was not a single science stream school or college to help them become doctors and engineers. ""We have completely changed this scenario and there are not just medical and engineering colleges but universities too now in tribal areas,"" he said.He performed the ground-breaking ceremony of 13 water supply projects for Tapi, Navsari and Surat districts, worth Rs 961 crore, as well as that of a medical college in Navsari, which will be built at a cost of Rs 542 crore. Speaking at a function held after the inauguration of the AM Naik Healthcare Complex and Nirali Multi-specialty Hospital near Navsari town by a trust headed by A M Naik, group chairman of engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro, the PM said, ""We have stressed on a holistic approach during the last eight years to improve our health sector. In addition to providing modern healthcare services, we are also giving importance to nutritious food, better hygiene and behavioural aspects related to preventive healthcare.""He also inaugurated projects worth Rs 163 crore under the ""Nal Se Jal"" campaign for pure drinking water for Surat, Navsari, Valsad and Tapi districts.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-launches-projects-worth-rs-3050-crore-for-gujrat-tribal-areas/articleshow/92136416.cms

The victim was killed after a heavy iron angle being fitted by three workers for the fifth floor ceiling collapsed and fell on the victim, who sustained grievous head injuries that proved fatal. The incident occurred around 6.10 pm on February 4.The deceased Vinod Bhoite, a Thane resident, worked on a contract basis with NMMC’s malaria department for fumigation work. After NMMC duty hours, Bhoite worked for private pest control contractor Amar Kamble. On February 4, after Bhoite finished his NMMC duty hours at 3pm, he was called by Kamble to the L&T unit in Mahape for pest control work.Acting on a complaint by Bhoite’s wife Neha (37), accused contractor Amar Kamble, two supervisors and three workers of L&T, who have not been named in the FIR, have been booked under Section 304A and 34 of the IPC.Rajendra Awadh, Senior Inspector of Turbhe MIDC Police said, “As Bhoite sustained severe head injuries after the heavy iron angle fell on him at the L&T company’s premises, he was rushed to NMMC hospital in Vashi. But the doctor’s declared him dead.”Awadh further said, “The kin of Bhoite along with a large number of NMMC’s contract workers took Bhoite’s body in an ambulance from NMMC hospital to L&T unit in Mahape, where they offered condolences. Thereafter, the agitators demanded monetary compensation and job for the kin of deceased Bhoite, as he was fatally injured in the company’s premises. The agitators took away Bhoite’s body for conducting his final rites, only after the L&T management declared a sum of around Rs 13 lakhs compensation to the kin of Bhoite.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/six-booked-for-death-of-worker-in-navi-mumbai/articleshow/89428005.cms

The oldest among three waited two years of the pandemic to get the coveted degrees. Most from the youngest came to the campus only for the convocation. While the middle one faced the toughest challenge of transitioning from a year of offline teaching to only online. Samruddhi Koli, who was awarded the best allround performance for 2020-22, found the online teaching mode opening up more learning opportunities.Eina Gupta, who bagged the best scholastic performance award for 2019-21, initially had an adjustment problem with online after having been taught for a year on campus.T Bharath, the best allround performance awardee from 2018-20, was mesmerized seeing the new state-of-the-art campus as he completed his course at the makeshift VNIT building.  Dimpy Khurana, gold medalist for scholastic performance from the batch of 2020-22, said though she missed the in-class experience at that time, the effort of their professors always encouraged them to transcend their abilities and learn everything about business education.“Our batch had the unique exposure of transitioning from online classes to the makeshift campus at VNIT, Bharosa, and finally the permanent campus at Mihan. These transitions were full of challenges, but with the support of faculty, administration, and fellow students, each one of us came out as a winner,” she said.SN Subrahmanyan, CEO and managing director, Larsen & Toubro, was the chief guest for the ceremony. “We are rapidly advancing towards the digital world and this is going to be our future. Be prepared to face the challenges of this digital world with new opportunities,” he said in his convocation address. CP Gurmani, chairman, Board of Governors at IIM-N, and insititute director Bhimaraya Metri were present.“Many crises like the Covid pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have plagued the world one after another. This has caused a lot of upheaval in all areas and created a lot of issues.

The current toll revenue of these six-laned highway projects – Vadodara-Baruch, Baruch-Surat and Surat-Dahisar - is around Rs 1,700 crore.The NHAI has been monetizing projects for 20 years to get upfront payment from successful bidders.These were among the first few projects which were bid out by the NHAI under the Build Operate and Transfer (BOT-Toll) model of Public Private Partnership (PPP). The first stretch had gone to Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and it had made upfront one-time premium payment of around Rs 475 crore and the other two projects were bagged by the IRB – one with premium payment and another on revenue-sharing model.“We have amicably completed the process of getting back the projects with no claims or counterclaims. This is also a successful example of how BOT-Toll projects can be managed well, protecting interests of the government agency and the private players. These are completed operational projects and the tolling has stabilized over years,” said an official.He added this is also the first case where an entire corridor will be back to NHAI at the end of the stipulated concession (contract) period after settling all issues amicably.The budget document for the road transport and highways ministry shows that the NHAI will monetize completed projects to generate Rs 20,000 during 2022-23. The provision has been made for raising another Rs 25,000 crore through innovative financing such as InvITs and securitisation of the future toll as it has been done for Delhi-Mumbai expressway project.Officials said more than 90% of the highway projects under the NHAI are financially viable and hence these projects can generate enough revenue to recover the investment. “As such all developed NHs under NHAI are monetized in some way or the other as the government can either get the revenue from toll every year or by bidding these projects to get upfront revenue for 15-years,” said one of them.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/3-gujarat-highway-stretches-may-be-lined-up-for-sale/articleshow/89713235.cms

Upholding the spirit of ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in its recent ruling, the bench said the subcontractor can raise the invoice by charging integrated goods and service tax (IGST) from its office in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. IGST is levied in case of an interstate supply of goods and services. Rulings given by the AAR have a persuasive value. Tax practitioners say that if this ruling is adopted pan-India, it will go a long way in reducing costs — both the cost of registration and other administrative costs for business entities. On the downside, the AAR also held that in the absence of an office in Karnataka, the subcontractor cannot register as an input service distributor. Such registration was required to avail of the input tax credit against goods/services procured from suppliers at the site and distribute such credit onward to its Noida registration.In this case, GEW India, a private limited company that had a unit in Noida and a registered office in Pune (Maharashtra), obtained a work order from Larsen & Toubro to execute a works contract inside a naval base at Karwar in Karnataka. It entailed a composite supply of goods and services, such as installation of a steel structure for harbouring of ships. The steel was fabricated at its Noida unit and installation was on-site.GEW India explained that they are likely to provide accommodation in Karnataka for the resident engineer and others who may visit the work site, but will not have any office or administrative staff. The AAR noted that the applicant company had only one principal place of business — Noida, for which GST registration had been obtained. Thus, there was no requirement for a separate registration in Karnataka for executing its contract.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-need-to-re-register-for-gst-aar/articleshow/87725724.cms

Its founding members include Bharti Airtel, Larsen & Toubro, Nelco (Tata Group), OneWeb, Mapmyindia, Walchandnagar Industries and Ananth Technology Limited.Companies have been eyeing the satellite-based broadband services business in India, and One Web -- where Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal's Bharti Global holds the largest stake and has other partners such as the UK government -- is one of the early starters.Other companies looking to enter the business include world’s richest businessmen Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. Musk’s satellite internet venture, Starlink, and Bezos' Amazon have held separate consultations with the telecom ministry – as well as the Department of Space – for starting satellite-based internet services in India and may apply for a license soon.The plan of the various companies eyeing the sector is to offer large swathes of bandwidth – with speeds as high as 1 GBPS and even more – through low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites that would be deployed at a distance of around 1,000 kms from the earth.The bandwidth would then be sold to a variety of users/customers that will include business enterprises, railways, shipping companies, defence establishments, airlines, and telecom companies, thus directly competing with the likes of Airtel and Jio. Also, these services can be used to reach dark zones in rural areas, as well as difficult terrains such as deserts and mountainous regions, and those infested with naxals and other sensitive locations.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-launch-industry-body-indian-space-association/articleshow/86844013.cms

The official cited a petition filed by a Tehri resident in the letter, also marked to chief secretary Om Prakash, asking the secretary of Union environment ministry to take appropriate action in this regard and provide “updated status of the project and the action taken”.Notably, the environment clearance was initially issued for ten years and was subsequently extended for three years and ended on August 23 this year. Bharat Jhunjhunwala, the petitioner, said, “The clearance, the techno-economic concurrence issued by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), and the agreement with the government of Uttarakhand states the end date as ‘commercial operation date’. And, according to their (L&T’s) Monday’s statement, clearly the project has not been commissioned or commercially operated.” He also expressed his disappointment as the L&T didn’t construct fish ladders (structures to facilitate movement of fishes) as required under the agreement with the government of Uttarakhand.Meanwhile, L&T, in its statement, said that the plant, situated along the Char Dham route, will be a major boost to the state of Uttarakhand as it has the capability of providing over 400 million units of renewable energy per annum.SN Subrahmanyan, CEO & MD, Larsen & Toubro, said, “Given the development imperatives of the state of Uttarakhand, this plant will be a key infrastructure ingredient for the region to become Atma Nirbhar (or self-reliant).”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/singolibhatwari-hydro-plant-gets-ready-gets-ready-but-is-environmental-clearance-in-place/articleshow/78241475.cms

In pics: 7-storey complex built in 45 days in BengaluruThe building, with a plinth area of 1.3 lakh sqft, will house the flight control system integration facility of Aeronautical Development Establishment, a DRDO lab. While the technology was developed by DRDO with the help of L&T, teams from IIT-Madras and IIT-Roorkee did design checks and provided technical support.  90300605 After inaugurating the building, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, “... Economic, political and strategic equations are changing all over the world and major world powers are in a tussle. Our defence needs have also increased and constant modernisation of armed forces is the need of the hour. We are constantly working to enhance our strategic capabilities,” he said, lauding DRDO for playing a crucial role in strengthening national security.  90303544DRDO chairman G Sateesh Reddy, while lauding the project team, said this has again proved that “India can build anything in a short time”.  90303545Singh expressed confidence that the new technology will increase productivity of the construction process, promote optimum utilisation of resources, reduce losses due to wastage, and help in speedy completion of projects.  90303553The facility will support R&D activities for developing avionics for fighter aircraft and FCS for Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) being undertaken by ADE. Tessy Thomas, director-general (aeronautical systems), said AMCA rollout can be expected in the next couple of years.  90303556The complex will provide simulator training to pilots of combat aircraft, which Singh described as its most important aspect as simulators provide an opportunity to learn through mistakes without resulting in losses.He said hybrid technology is an important milestone for the construction sector and hoped India can become one of the leading countries in the field. “The traditional construction industry is generally considered to be labour-intensive, high-risk and low on productivity. But the way DRDO has constructed the complex, our infrastructure projects will be completed in a low-cost and time-bound manner,” he said. How mission was achieved DRDO said the 45-day mission was made possible with hybrid construction technology, used for the first time in the construction industry in the country. “... In hybrid construction technology, the column and beam elements of the structural frame are built with steel plates. The column is of hollow steel tubular section. These columns are concrete-filled steel hollow cross-sections. The slabs are partially precast and all these structural members are assembled at site. Concreting is done simultaneously to make the structure monolithically cast, thus eliminating any dry joints as in case of precast construction,” an official statement read. In this case of concrete-filled hollow sections, DRDO said, steel provides a permanent framework to the concrete core which reduces the time and effort drastically when compared to conventional construction.

Sources said 20 such equipment will be rolled out for this project.With this, India is now coming in the select group of countries like Italy, Norway, Korea and China, which have been designing and manufacturing such equipment, the railway ministry said. These equipment built in India, for the first time, will end or reduce dependence on import of such equipment for mega elevated infrastructure projects.Officials said the “straddle carrier” flagged off by the minister is the biggest in the country and the “girder transporter” for transporting and fixing full span precast girders is the largest in India. These equipment have been built by the construction major, Larsen and Toubro in India, which has bagged the tender to build the major stretch of the first High Speed Rail corridor in the country.According to the National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHRSCL), which is implementing the project, 85% of the components used in the two equipment has been sourced from India and 15% from Spain and Germany.The “straddle carrier” is a tyre mounted self-propelled gantry crane designed to handle the full span precast girders from casting bed to stacking yard. This has 80 tyres. The crane has the capacity to lift up to 1,100 tonnes and a 52.5 meter long and 37 meter wide girder at one time. Similarly, the 27-axle tyre mounted self-propelled trolley “girder transporter” having 216 tyres is designed to transport the full span precast girders fed by bridge gantry to erection location.Speaking at the flag off ceremony, Vaishnaw said soon there will be more High Speed Rail projects in the country.

Companies like Zoho, Kissflow, and M2P Fintech have had company-wide discussions on moonlighting to clarify that the practice is acceptable as long as the company's intellectual property is not compromised. They have asked staff to talk to their managers should there be any ambiguity. A few startups TOI spoke to are also working to tweak employment contracts to accommodate needs of employees working on non-competing startup ideas along with holding full-time positions at the company. Others are launching specific programmes to hire and accommodate moonlighters.API infrastructure startup M2P Fintech said moonlighting is a reality among the developer community today as they dabble in various technology projects, or work on their own startup ideas, and they plan to align company policies to this reality. ""We need to consider the needs of people who are trying to work on startup ideas or projects not directly related to the IP created here, and allow them to pursue these ideas while having a stable salary,"" Prabhu Rangarajan, co-founder and COO of M2P Fintech, said. The company has had an open chat with employees and made this stance clear to them, he added. M2P has started engaging with their legal team to relax and restructure contracts for such employees on the basis of their disclosures. They are also working to start an internal idea group where employees can bounce off startup ideas and explore product-market fit. The company also plans to extend the option of flexible working hours to such employees.Kissflow founder and CEO Suresh Sambandam says they have discussed the issue with employees in a townhall and urged them to assess the nature of their side gigs. “If the project is competing in nature , we are open to restructure the employment terms as a contractual engagement so that we reset expectations and it’s a win-win” Sambandam said.Rajendran Dandapani, director of technology at Zoho Corp, told TOI that apart from a pre-existing clause in contracts about parallel employment, the company has also clarified its stance on moonlighting during weekly townhalls with CEO Sridhar Vembu. ""When it comes to individuals pursuing creative interests like podcasting, painting, sports, etc, we like to encourage employees. However, if it comes to working for a competitor, it's clearly unethical and we do not allow that. That being said, we do not monitor our employees and instead, have always trusted them to do the right thing,"" he said. There are numerous instances of successful startups that have been founded by entrepreneurs who were former employees of Zoho, including Girish Mathrubootham's Nasdaq-listed Freshworks.""What was perceived as wrong even a decade ago is acceptable today. The point is to develop adaptable and fluid HR policies that consider differing viewpoints,"" Siddhartha Gupta, CEO of talent assessment firm Mercer Mettl, said. At Mercer Mettl, transparency is key and to volunteer/work with an organisation (unrelated to Mercer Mettl), employees can declare the same and re-sign a no conflict of interest document.Food tech giant Swiggy was among those who kicked off the entire debate around moonlighting by framing a policy that not just allowed emloyees to pick up additional projects outside work, but also decided to support them. In case of projects that leverage their professional know-how, employees can pursue them once they are approved by Swiggy. Cisco India is among the big tech firms where employees can undertake projects in the same domain with appropriate disclosures and approvals, as long as they don't work for a competitor. “Employees can seek our approval on the projects they want to do, and the kind of remuneration they are likely to get for it. I am also a part of two boards. These are open conversations we have and expect employees to have in our organisation. We have hard skills, and if someone wants to teach a startup in the same area as us, or mentor them, we do not have an objection, but it has to be an open conversation and done with approval,” Daisy Chittilapilly, president of Cisco India and Saarc told TOI.L&T group company Larsen & Toubro Technology Services (LTTS) also believes technical skills can be put to use outside the office without threat to client confidentiality. The company's employees are allowed to teach technical skills or even engage in CSR activities, LTTS CEO Amit Chadha recently told TOI. The exception is working for competition or for somebody in the same domain. ""It is not acceptable because I have data privacy guidelines and I’m worried about what is getting shared in the open about my client,” he says.“At Chargebee, our relationships with team members thrives on the foundation of mutual transparency and trust… we value outcomes and not hours,” Krish Subramanian, co-founder, Chargebee said. Chargebee has instances employees working on their side projects to build SaaS products, people who have written books and run their podcasts etc. “We do make our team members understand that if working with multiple companies is what they wish to do, they should move into contract position and not full time employment with Chargebee, unless they can declare their side projects especially if there is a dilemma of conflict,” Subramanian added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/-mid-tier-it-cos-open-to-conditional-side-gig-work/articleshow/95089352.cms

He was speaking at the golden jubilee celebrations of the television wing of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII). “The exigencies on our active and unsettled borders, both west and north, have only increased in the times of the pandemic. The Indian Army, however, has stood strong and tall in the face of these challenges,” he said.General Naravane appreciated the role of the mainstream cinema in reinforming the core values, preserving the diverse culture of the country and galvanizing the nation in times of crisis. However, he pointed that the “stereotyping” of characters of the Indian Armed forces officers in cinemas should be changed The FTII dedicated its television wing building to the multifaceted PL Deshpande, fondly called Pu La, and also dedicated the TV studios in the memory of P Kumar Vasudev and Vasant Mulay. General Narvane said Pu La always brought a smile on our faces.He said Mulay and P Kumar Vasudev were pioneers in shaping Indian television. Renowned filmmakers Sai Paranjpye and director Jabbar Patel were the guests of honour. The chief praised the FTII’s contributions in launching short courses in Jammu and Kashmir under the skill India initiative. The FTII director Bhupendra Kainthola said FTII conducted courses on smartphone film making, among others in areas of Jamme and Kashmir. Earlier, the chief visited Tata Motors in Pimpri, where he watched the operations of assembly lines of passenger, commercial vehicles and Engineering Research Centre. He also visited the strategic systems complex of the Larsen &Toubro at Talegaon.

The Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, recently notified by the state government with a few tweaks, has made these offences non-compoundable, which means that the offenders may have to appear before court. Law enforcement officers are not too happy with this modification as it would increase their workload tremendously.Previously, offences such as wrong side driving, lane cutting etc., attracted a paltry fine of Rs 200. ""Sending an offender to court should be limited to serious offences such as drunk driving. It's impractical to do so for comparatively petty offences. We are in the process of proposing to the Central Government to let petty offences remain compoundable, which means that the offender can pay a fine and the matter is settled,"" said an IPS officer.  88288047An official from the state transport commissioner's office, however, said that taking offenders to court for these offences was necessary given the number of road crashes and constant complaints of wrong side driving and lane cutting.  Activists are concerned how this would work given that courts are already piled up with pending cases. ""The problem of wrong-side driving has reached massive proportions in Mumbai and violent reprisals are common if a motorist tries to confront the offender. There is an urgent need to carry out enforcement drives and clamp down on offenders on a large scale at well-identified locations, along with an additional force augmenting the traffic department,"" said activist and communications professional Naraayan Kannan.Trupti Amritwar, CEO of the non-profit, Mumbai Environment and Social Network, said that sending offenders to court may sound stringent but may not prove to be a deterrent. ""Hiking fines for lane cutting and making offenders pay penalties on the spot would work better,"" she added. Lane cutting is common on arterial roads such as SV Road, LBS Marg or Western and Eastern Express highways. Motorists say wrong side driving has grown rampant under Lalbaug flyover, on JVLR after the Larsen & Toubro flyover, P D'Mello Road, Mankhurd, Govandi, Sakinaka and even on highways. Over 47500 motorists were challaned for driving in the wrong direction between January and August 2021, which is more than those challaned throughout 2020 (around 31000 challans). But only 14% offenders paid up the fines this year. Another significant modification in the Amendment Act is that the minimum fines for traffic offences is now Rs 500 (from the previous Rs 200) for a first-time offender and at least Rs 1500 for a second-time offender.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-wrong-side-driving-cutting-lane-youll-be-taken-to-court/articleshow/88288049.cms

Three construction firms — Larsen & Toubro, Afcons Infrastructure, and NCC — participated in the civil work tender for the 25km Byappanahalli-Yeshwantpur-Chikkabanavara (Mallige) Line. The technical bid was opened on Wednesday. Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (K-RIDE), which is executing the project, said it is likely to issue the work order to the selected firm by the end of this month. “We will finalise the technical bid in 10-15 days after assessing parameters such as liquidity, turnover, expertise and bid capacity of the firm. Eligible firms will qualify for the financial bid. Our rough estimate for the civil work is around Rs 1,000 crore. If qualified firms have quoted within this estimate, we will award the contract to L1 (lowest quotation) by this month-end,” said a senior K-RIDE official. K-RIDE is expecting the civil work to be completed in 27 months.89984566Contrary to expectations, firms such as ITD Cementation and Tata Projects Ltd didn’t participate in the tendering process. Meanwhile, Egis-Louis Berger-AECOM JV received the general consultant (GC) contract of the project for Rs 196 crore. “We will issue an LoA (letter of acceptance) to Egis JV in a few days. Egis is a reputed global firm which will monitor the progress of the project,” said an official. Separately, RITES has been appointed to provide transaction advisory services for procurement, operation and maintenance of rolling stock on PPP model for the project. “We will soon float a tender to procure rolling stock under the PPP model since the process takes more time. This is also the first time that rolling stock is being inducted on a PPP basis, so we are working out the modalities,” another official said. The Mallige corridor will have stations at Byappanahalli, Kasturinagar, Sevanagar, Banaswadi, Nagawara, Kanakanagar, Hebbal, Lottegollahalli, Yeshwantpur, Jalahalli, Shettihalli, Myadarahalli and Chikkabanavara. Kanaka Line likely to be operational first K-RIDE is planning to float a tender for the Heelalige-Yelahanka-Rajanukunte (Kanaka) Line by next month. Though tender for Mallige Line has been called first, officials said Kanaka will be operational before that. “The Kanaka Line is mostly at-grade, except in some places like Marathahalli where it becomes elevated. At-grade construction is easier. We are planning to complete the work by December 2024. Mallige Line will be ready by the first quarter of 2025,” said a K-RIDE official.

The Public Works Department (PWD) is trying to finish the residual work of the bridge with shifting of the railway quarters being underway. The railway quarters fell in the path of the ramp of the bridge linking Cossipore Road.Ghatak said the state had already released Rs 11 crore for the relocation of the staff quarters a few months ago. The Railways has started the work of relocation and work is now on track “We are hopeful of completing the work by March,” Ghatak said. Atin Ghosh, an MLA from Cossipore-Belgachhia, raised the issue of delay in construction at the state Assembly on Tuesday and sought Ghatak’s intervention at his level in taking up the matter with the Eastern Railway authorities. In reply, Ghatak assured fast-track completion of the bridge which involves a cost of Rs 350 crore. Ghatak said construction had been stuck for the last few months because of the 38 railway quarters that had come in the way. The entire staff quarters needs to be relocated for PWD to start its construction work. The new bridge will have a wider and longer ramp to connect Cossipore Road with the upcoming Tallah Bridge for smooth movement of vehicles from Shyambazar to Dunlop.A crucial 240-metre section of the 750m new bridge will stand over the Tallah tracks in the ER zone. ER’s chief bridge engineer has already passed the design and drawings relating to the girder launching. PWD had been expecting the girder launching to start this month.Initially, there was a delay in getting permission from the Commissioner of Railway Safety regarding construction of pillars for the project. At present, steel girders made by Larsen & Toubro at Panagarh are awaiting the clearance of the ER authorities so that they can be commissioned at the site. “Work will be delayed unless we get the nod from ER,” said Ghosh.The dismantling work of the 57-year-old Tallah Bridge, which was a crucial link between Kolkata and the northern fringes, had begun in February 2020 after RITES and, most importantly, Bridge and Cons-truction expert V K Raina recommended pulling down the structure.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/can-keep-to-mar-apr-tallah-reopening-deadline-min/articleshow/87634504.cms
LT,2022-11-20T12:44:00+05:30,Chethan Kumar,Why India's space startups are set for many more firsts,"India News: While rocket launches grab headlines, private firms are working in tandem with Isro to do everything from earth imaging to space weather monitoring","India is unlikely to produce an Elon Musk or a Jeff Bezos any time soon, but the domestic space sector has grown to display some promise in recent months. On Friday, Skyroot Aerospace’s sub-orbital mission, Prarambh, marked the beginning of private launch activity albeit on a micro scale. As Isro chairman S Somanath says, the launch of (Skyroot’s) Vikram-S, a small, single-stage rocket, will “demonstrate that young people with a dream to build something big can actually do so in India”.While Skyroot is the first, there are already other private companies gearing up for missions, not just from the rocket side, but also satellites and applications. Ramesh Nagasamudram, vice-president, Aniara SpaceCom, a consultancy that specialises in satellite services, believes the space sector is poised for growth like the IT sector. “One welcome change has been Isro’s support. Isro is walking the talk with a visible willingness to listen and encourage as well as extend its infrastructure resources. Also, startups are more industry and revenue focused, addressing global markets,” he says.“We made history today by launching India’s first private rocket. It is a symbol of new India, and just the… https://t.co/ab2V1V582u— Skyroot Aerospace (@SkyrootA) 1668752175000One major milestone in the private sector’s journey so far is the contract the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-Larsen & Toubro consortium bagged to manufacture five Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLV) outside of Isro for the first time. The formal contract worth around Rs 860 crore was signed in September.Given that a rocket launch is the most visible aspect of the space sector, it often overshadows other equally significant work being carried out. Even a mammoth Isro suffers from this with its work almost always measured by the number of launches it carries out.But not all news is from the launch segment. From patents on critical technologies to indigenous product development and projects that have the potential of giving India an edge, there have been a lot of developments in the months following June 2020, when India announced its intent to open up the sector. And some interesting projects are in the pipeline too.In 2021, Agnikul Cosmos, Bellatrix and Pixxel had signed memorandum of understanding with Isro, while also working closely with the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Center (IN-SPACe), India’s space regulator-and-promoter.In the last few months, several tests that validated key technologies built by private firms have been carried out, while some kicked off operations. Pixxel launched Shakuntala — India’s first privately built earth imaging satellite — on a SpaceX rocket. The firm will launch its second satellite, Anand, on a PSLV later this month. Digantara and Dhruva Space have launched tech demonstration payloads on a PSLV earlier this year. Digantara has also signed an MoU to set up India’s first private ground-based space observatory. Digantara CEO Anirudh Sharma says, “We’ve identified that space weather is a crucial aspect that will help enhance the accuracy of our solution. Which is why we launched the patented weather monitor on PSLV.” medium95637445IN-SPACe helps coordinate between private space firms and Isro. “From facilitating access to various Isro infrastructure to mentoring and promotions, we’re providing end-to-end support,” says Vinod Kumar, its director-promotions. IN-SPACe has 294 entities registered with it, of which 89 are startups. It is vetting another 158 project applications.Following Skyroot, Agnikul, will launch its sub-orbital mission. It recently received a key system from Isro, another first as a system built for Isro rockets has never before been used by a private entity. “The industry now has clarity about whom to approach from Isro or IN-SPACe and they’ve been working very closely with industry,” says Agnikul co-founder Srinath Ravichandran. <iframe title=""The room to grow for Indian space economy"" aria-label=""Table"" id=""datawrapper-chart-yft61"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/yft61/1/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""350"" data-external=""1""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Isro and IN-SPACe support being key is something Ajay Kumar, founder-CEO, Vellon Space, and Pawan Kumar Chandana, CEO, Skyroot, also echo.

The likelihood of rate action as well as liquidity reduction measures, it is feared, might adversely affect economic growth which is already slowing down owing to high inflation and its consequences for consumption spending.""The condition is further accentuated by the fact that oil prices are trading relatively higher and the prospects of the same moving lower in the near future looks bleak. These factors will continue to occupy the mind of the market as we progress further into the month,"" said Joseph Thomas, Head of Research, Emkay Wealth Management.In the broader market, the BSE midcap gauge declined 1.45 per cent on Friday and the smallcap index lost 1.16 per cent.Among BSE sectoral indices, power index tanked 2.40 per cent, followed by basic materials (2.31 per cent), utilities (2.21 per cent) and auto (1.74 per cent).

Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) plunged the most at 14.82%, while Union Bank dragged 10.57%. Interestingly, PSU Bank stocks were generating the highest returns for investors since the last 2 months. Metal and Media indices also dragged 4.47% and 4.99%, respectively. Metal stocks fell amid rising Covid-19 concerns in China, the world's largest consumer of steel. * US economic data US weekly jobless claims data pointed to a still tight labour market, while the US economy rebounded faster than previously estimated in the third quarter.Specifically, investors are fretting that the Fed funds target rate could rise higher and stay there longer than previously expected, raising the possibility of an economic contraction.Market attention will now shift to US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data due later on Friday that will provide further clues on whether inflation is continuing to moderate.The US central bank raised interest rates by 50 basis point this month after four consecutive 75 basis-point hikes this year, but Chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed will deliver more hikes in 2023 even as the economy slips towards a recession.* Rising Covid fears Rising Covid cases in world's second biggest economy China has spooked investor sentiments globally, amid concerns about the new variant of infection. China's stringent zero-Covid policy deployed mass testing and strict quarantine measures, which were revised earlier this month in the wake of mass anti-government protests.Several Chinese cities endured lengthy lockdowns, often prompted by a handful of infections and there were indications that people were starting to run out of patience.Experts are now predicting a difficult time ahead, with a grim prediction that close to 2 million deaths due to the virus by next year.India has also strengthened Covid measures and re-introduced random testing of international arrivals from December 24. * Global markets sentiments Global shares were mixed on Friday as the last full trading week of the year comes to a close, with looming US inflation data a reminder of how surging prices and interest rates have fundamentally shifted investor thinking over the past 12 months.Wall Street fell sharply overnight after a resilient final estimate of third-quarter US gross domestic product and other data fuelled worries that the Federal Reserve would keep hiking interest rates for longer than feared.Oil prices rose on expectations of a drop in Russian crude supply, helping to offset worries of a hit to US transport fuel demand as a pending deep freeze Arctic storm threatens travel during the Christmas holiday season.China stocks were little changed, while Hong Kong stocks fell as China grapples with soaring COVID-19 infections, in the wake of Beijing dismantling its strict zero-Covid policy to contain the virus.* Japan inflation Recent data released showed Japanese inflation hitting a 41-year high. This reinforced expectations that the country's central bank will lift interest rates next year.Investors have been on a rollercoaster ride this month with slowing inflation and an easing of monetary policy hikes offset by central bank warnings that borrowing costs will likely have to go higher than expected.Those worries were increased by the Bank of Japan's shock decision this week to move away from its ultra-loose monetary policy, increasing bets on an even more restrictive investment environment in 2023.* Rupee falls The rupee declined by 7 paise to close at 82.86 (provisional) against the US dollar on Friday due to firm crude oil prices and steep losses in domestic stocks amid growing concerns about interest rate hikes.Analysts said investors are concerned that strong US economic data will lead the Federal Reserve to double down on its interest rate hikes to control inflation.(With inputs from agencies)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/markets/sensex/sensex-nifty-plunge-for-4th-day-in-a-row-top-reasons-behind-market-fall/articleshow/96455152.cms

It has been learnt that DK Sen, Director cum Vice President (Development Projects), Larsen & Toubro, wrote a letter to the Chairman of PSPCL offering the thermal plant which has been built with Japanese equipment and supercritical technology has a high plant load factor and top fuel efficiency, at a cost of Rs 10,000 crore. The director has put on record that the ‘company wants to get out of the power generation business,’ while thanking the Punjab Government for its ‘invaluable cooperation.’Surprisingly, the plant which became operational in 2014 was brought up at a cost of Rs around 10,000 crores and it is being contended that the company wants to make a profit by selling at the same price six years later. During this time, the company has also booked profits from the sale of power to the state government. The Rajpura Thermal Plant has two units of 700 MW capacity each. The first unit was commissioned on February 1, 2014, and the second on July 10, 2014. The company had signed a long-term power purchase agreement with the state government for a period of 25-years. The IPPs in Punjab faced a lot of political heat time with various leaders demanding cancellation of the long term power purchase agreements (PPAs) citing the high cost of power in Punjab. L&T feels that if the plant is taken over by the power corporation, it will save the company from the frequent blame game. Surprisingly, the cost of power from IIPs is far less as compared to state-owned thermal power plants which range between Rs 2.15 to Rs 2.45 a unit. It is the accumulated debts of the power corporation which now stands at over Rs 32000 crore and the interest that is paid on this debt which jacks up the cost of power for the end users. Till date, the power com has procured power worth Rs 21,369 crore from Rajpura Thermal till March 31, 2020, including fixed charges of Rs 1,734 crore. In the last financial year, power was purchased from this thermal at Rs 5.05 per unit after the Supreme Court had ordered that the coal washing and other transport charges are to be borne by the power corporation. It is apprehended that taking over the Rajpura thermal plant by the state government might put an additional burden on the state consumers and the power corporation may face losses over the next 20 years, even as the move will wipe out the fixed charges.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lt-proposes-to-sell-rajpura-thermal-power-plant-to-punjab/articleshow/77949629.cms

The corridor is one among three corridors in the 118.9km phase-2 project, expected to be completed by 2026.84640734Sources said three firms -Larsen & Toubro, ITD Cementation and JMC Projects – had bid for the project, proposing to complete it in a span of three years.“On OMR, we will be building the elevated line on the second level and it will be on the second and third level in junctions like Sholinganallur.

Delivery will begin from January 2023 onwards.86955913The monorail currently operates with seven rakes, of which two are kept on stand-by, and services are at a frequency of 20 minutes. MMRDA announced that Indian firm Medha Servo Drives Ltd will supply 10 rakes of four cars each for the 20-km Chembur to Jacob Circle corridor.  “With the introduction of 10 more rakes, a headway of five minutes can be achieved. With this headway, there will be a substantial increase in ridership and revenue. Delivery will be over by January 2024,” said metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas. MMRDA said the new rakes will be spacious and have better safety features. Medha Servo will have to design the rake before starting supply.  The weight of each currently operational coach is 13.5 ton. Coaches in the new rakes will be lighter, decreasing load on the guideway and piers, and also faster. The carrying capacity of the coaches will increase too, but the actual number will be known only after the design is approved. A source said, “As against the current capacity of 568 passengers per train, the new coaches will have at least 10% more capacity.” MMRDA said the cost of maintenance will be lower compared to previous trains due to the Make in India programme. “Spare parts will be easily available in the near future for maintenance purposes. Also, new bogies will be made of stainless steel, just like the Metro,” said an official. MMRDA had appointed the Larsen & Toubro and Scomi Engineering (LTSE) consortium as contractors for the monorail project in 2008. The system has been plagued with problems as Scomi could not provide adequate rakes, thus hampering the project. The consortium was not able to meet terms of contract and has provided only 10 rolling stock units against a provision of 15 as per the contract. Out of the 10, the contractor cannibalised two (thus making them useless) and one was gutted in a fire in November 2017. In December 2018, MMRDA terminated the contractor “for failure to perform and fulfil contractual obligations”. MMRDA took over operations of the entire corridor in March 2019.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-monorail-frequency-to-go-from-20-mins-to-5-as-10-new-trains-ordered/articleshow/86949986.cms

Besides direct moves to spike the intake of women in its massive workforce, L&T and its constituent business verticals in particular, embraced ‘Winspire’ which was aimed at spreading awareness and greater acceptance of workplace diversity and inclusion, starting this International Women’s Day (widely observed in L&T on March 8).  Company sources said that ‘Winspire’, was not a “one off” event and would be observed in greater measure across all L&T verticals in the years to come. A number of women employees working across many of its Group companies contributed stories on various facets of their organisational and personal lives, which were compiled into a coffee table book that was released online by L&T CEO & MD S N Subrahmanyan on March 8.  Speaking on the occasion, Subrahmanyan said, “As things settle and start returning to what is the new normal, all of us, more particularly the women, will find fresh moorings, new ways of working and new opportunities to succeed.”  “Even as ‘Winspire’ is expected to take deeper roots, L&T, in accordance with its commitment to D&I will continue to view “success in today’s world” as “gender agnostic and entirely dependent on how well one capitalises on the available opportunities,” he said.     Company data indicate a steady rise in the intake of women at three major entry levels – Graduate Engineer Trainees (GETs), Post-Graduate Engineer Trainees (PGETs) and Management Trainees (MTs) across most Group companies, with Subrahmanyan declaring that there were now “more and more women on the shop floor, project sites and offices.”  The Company leadership has taken several focused initiatives to restore and sustain a favourable gender ratio and there has been a significant shift in the mindset, which in the past formed the basis for relying on “male-dominated professions”.  In his address to L&T employees, Subrahmanyan’s thrust was on the crucial development in D&I. He said, “D&I has been made a critical part of almost daily functioning within the Company that has always valued its combined ability to allow the flourishing of differences and diversity. This in turn has encouraged the flowering of multiple viewpoints, thought processes and perspectives to work together in assimilative ways to reach our goals”.  L&T’s senior executives are fully aware and grounded that a diverse set of experiences, perspectives and backgrounds are crucial to innovation and development of new ideas. In a study conducted by Forbes, respondents from several companies, including L&T, agreed that gender diversity is crucial to encouraging different perspectives and ideas that foster innovation.   Without shying away from admitting that L&T has “to do much more on D&I”, Subrahmanyan said that the Company management is upbeat on breaking new grounds to allow D&I to take deeper roots across all its other verticals. “L&T has always been and will remain an organisation of opportunities. It is for each individual, man or woman, to seek, find and succeed. All you women of the modern day seek nor take any quarter; for you it is not a question of who is going to let you, rather you dare who will stop you, he affirmed.”   <p style=""font-style:italic; border-bottom:0 font-size: 15px;"">Disclaimer: Content Produced by Larsen & Toubro</p>",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lt-embarks-on-a-mission-to-make-gender-equality-a-reality-with-winspire/articleshow/81461976.cms

The Vikrant is the largest-ever,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to commission India's first indigenous aircraft carrier 'Vikrant' in Kochi on September 2.According to government officials, the Prime Minister was briefed on the capabilities of the carrier.The Vikrant is the largest-ever warship built in India and would be a landmark event for the navy and the country, they said.""Vikrant is a true manifestation of Atmanirbhar Bharat, built with 76 per cent indigenous components,"" Southern Naval Commander Vice Admiral MA Hampiholi said while speaking about the biggest ever Make-in-India initiative in the country.Vikrant is designed by the Indian Navy's in-house Directorate of Naval Design (DND) and built by CSL, a Public Sector Shipyard under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, the carrier is christened after her illustrious predecessor, India's first aircraft carrier 'Vikrant' which played a vital role in the 1971 Indo-Pak war.""The impending commissioning of the indigenous aircraft carrier Vikrant is indeed historic as it gives us the ability as a country to join a few select nations which are able to design and construct aircraft carriers. The Navy's in-house design directorate designed the ship and it has been built by Cochin Shipyard Limited here at Kochi. And indeed, it's a true manifestation of Atmanirbhar Bharat. About 76 per cent of the cost of the ship by way of equipment and services is entirely indigenous,"" Vice Admiral Hampiholi told ANI.The 262-meter-long carrier has a full displacement of close to 45,000 tonnes which is much larger and more advanced than her predecessor.Speaking about the specifications of IAC Vikrant, Vice Admiral Hampiholi said: ""Vikrant carries a mix of about 30 aircraft. It could fly the MiG 29k fighter aircraft in anti-air, anti-surface and land attack roles. It will be able to operate the Kamov 31 which is an early air warning helicopter, the recently inducted but yet-to-be commissioned MH-60R which is a multi-role helicopter as also our very indigenous ALH. It displaces about 45,000 tonnes which is definitely the largest warship in the Indian naval inventory.""With Vikrant, India has joined a select group of nations having the niche capability to indigenously design and build an aircraft carrier.IAC Vikrant consist of 14 decks with 2,300 compartments which can carry around 1,500 sea warriors and to cater to the food requirements, around 10,000 chapatis or rotis are made in the ship's kitchen, which is called the ship's galley.Hampiholi said: ""Just to give an idea the amount of steel which has been used in the ship is enough to perhaps make four Eiffel Towers. The ship's cabling runs almost about 2,400 kilometres which is roughly the distance between Kochi to Delhi. Each of these MIG 29K aircraft weigh as much as about two African elephants and indeed, I must also mention that the ship generates enough electricity perhaps to power a small town and these are the kinds of specifications which we tried to relate ordinarily. But definitely, it can travel close to about 27-28 knots. And as I said most of the equipment onboard the ship is indigenous.""Highlighting the possible role of the Vikrant, Vice Admiral mentioned the carrier can be utilized to project power to ensure safety and security on the high seas and also provide credible deterrence with extreme visibility.""Most important facet of the carrier is the fact that like any other warship it can discharge a variety of roles that it is mandated. Be it diplomatic, be benign, when I mean benign, I mean humanitarian assistance, disaster relief operations, constabulary as also the military role. The ship can like any other warship be utilized to project power to ensure safety and security at high seas and also provide credible deterrence with extreme visibility. I would say that a carrier battle group that is a squad of a carrier along with a carrier which is centered on INS Vikrant background will provide Indian Navy extreme flexibility sustainance and reach for the accomplishment of missions in the Indian Ocean region with persistence and presence definitely it's a big shot in the arm,"" he added.Hampiholi said Vikrant will give the impetus to further Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of security and growth for all in the region (SAGAR) and added,"" it would also give impetus to be the first responder as also the preferred security partner in our immediate maritime neighbourhood.""Vikrant has been built with a high degree of automation for machinery operation, ship navigation and survivability, and has been designed to accommodate an assortment of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft.Using a novel aircraft-operation mode known as STOBAR (Short Take-Off but Arrested Landing), the IAC is equipped with a ski-jump for launching aircraft, and a set of 'arrester wires' for their recovery onboard.The ship has a large number of indigenous equipment and machinery, involving major industrial houses in the country such as BEL, BHEL, GRSE, Keltron, Kirloskar, Larsen & Toubro, Wartsila India etc as well as over 100 MSMEs. The indigenisation efforts also led to development of ancillary industries, besides the generation of employment opportunities and bolstering plough back effect on the economy, both locally as well as pan-India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-set-to-commission-countrys-first-made-in-india-aircraft-carrier-vikrant-on-september-2/articleshow/93737924.cms

Sena MP (south central Mumbai) Rahul Shewale and BJP MLA Kalidas Kolambhkar arrived to ensure it was carried out. After nearly three years an eligibility survey was being attempted there. Mhada’s failure to carry out the survey, shift tenants and hand over land to its contractor, Larsen & Toubro, for construction had resulted in the company withdrawing from the project, but it was convinced to stay on.A senior Mhada official said local Congress has been opposing the redevelopment, demanding that the GR allowing redevelopment under section 33(9)(b) of Development Control and Promotion Regulations (2034) be first amended to allow permanent resident agreements for eligible tenants.Congress leader Raju Waghmare said it was wrong of Mhada to carry out the survey during lockdown. “I told Shewale every building has 500-700 residents. They would have to line up outside for the survey and interact with officials and police. It could turn into a Covid super spreader. Shewale agreed, and it was decided not to have the survey,” he said. Mhada had planned to do the survey on May 24-25.Shewale said the CM agreed to the permanent agreement and a revised GR will be issued soon. “PWD has the documents. It will carry out the survey. Mhada and the collector’s department are not required to do it now,” he said.Kolambhkar said Congress was keen to hand over redevelopment to a private contractor but BJP is firm it must be done by government under Mhada’s supervision. Waghmare said government must decide on eligibility of those who purchased the tenements post-1996 and have no proof prior.

Even 11 rounds of talks couldn’t bring them back to fields.Their campaign against the corporate world has moved from half-yearly stocktaking on September 30 to March 31 annual performance audit. The farmers see World Trade Organisation (WTO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank behind the Centres’ agri-marketing laws.The bills got through a heated debate in the Rajya Sabha on September 20 and Presidential approval on September 27, but on October 1, 2020, 30 farmer unions occupied railway tracks, toll plazas, corporate outlets, and refueling stations in protest, besides cordoning the homes of senior members of the Punjab BJP, a thing which is on for 180 days. The tracks were vacated but the hijacking of the toll plazas has cost the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) Rs 550 crore, so far. NHAI regional officer R P Singh said: “Punjab’s 25 national highway toll plazas are free for the past six months. Barring only a couple, those in Haryana are free, too, and our losses are mounting.”Besides Ambani and Adani, Vedanta and L&T (Larsen and Toubro) also had their property and business assets destroyed in Punjab, while the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) blocked coal supplies to the thermal-electricity plants of these corporate houses. The latest in its line of fire is the Adani dry port at Kila Raipur in Ludhiana district.The farmer unions claim to have lost 300 comrades in these six months of protest. BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said: “We have stopped counting the months. We survived zero temperature and we’ll survive the 45-degree-Celsius heat, too, but not retreat until victory and the repeal of three laws. The government is free to test our patience.

The requirement of another bridge was felt due to frequent traffic snarls on the existing two-lane narrow bridge.A detailed project report was submitted by state road construction department in 2018, which was approved by the expenditure finance committee of MoRTH in July 2020. Subsequently, PM Narendra Modi laid the foundation for the bridge through video conferencing from New Delhi on September 21 last year. Meanwhile, the former deputy CM, while thanking Union MoRTH minister Nitin Gadkari, said the 4.367-km long bridge with 68 pillars will be constructed 50-metre east of the Vikramshila Setu. “The state government has acquired 21.3 hectares of land needed for the bridge from its internal resources,” he added.“The parallel bridge will be constructed within four years,” Modi said in reference to Gadkari’s reply to his question in the Rajya Sabha recently. He added the construction company will maintain the bridge for 10 years after its commissioning.An NHAI official said 875-metre approach road, designated as NH-131B, on the northern end of the proposed bridge (Naugachia end) and 987-metre approach road on the southern end (Bhagalpur end) would also be constructed along with the parallel bridge.

It will take at least 70 days to remove debris from the site and then the temple base will be laid after digging 40feet below ground level. Stones, lime and concrete will be used in the foundation and a retaining wall will be built around the base.” Dr Mishra, however, refused to divulge whether cement and iron will be used in the retaining wall.During the grand puja at Ramjanmabhoomi, construction committee chairman, Nripendra Mishra, made the announcement to devotees and trust members about recommencing construction of the temple.

The SIB is also the first impact bond involving public, private partners and a public private partnership organisation, NSDC.The coalition has brought together a US$14.4 million fund to benefit 50,000 young people in India over four years. The target group includes 60% women and girls and to equip them with skills and vocational training and provide access to wage-employment in Covid-19 recovery sectors, including retail, apparel, healthcare, and logistics. The stakeholders will work towards promoting effective interventions, supporting research and enhancing the impact of the skill development programme.“India’s aspirational youth require skills for the jobs that meet the demand of the industry. Core functional knowledge and competencies enhance an individual's ability to secure and retain a job and improve their potential to earn.

These are Apollo Medskills Ltd, Gram Tarang Employability Training Services Pvt Ltd, Learnet Skills Ltd, Magic Bus India Foundation and PanIIT Alumni Foundation.Impact bonds are innovative financing instruments that leverage private sector capital and expertise, with a focus on achieving results. It shifts the focus from inputs to performance and results. Rather than a government or a donor financing a project upfront, private investors (risk investors) initially finance the initiative and are repaid by ‘outcome funders’, only if agreed-upon outcomes are achieved. The outcomes to be measured are agreed upon at the outset and independently verified.Millions of Indians have lost their jobs during the pandemic. Youth have been hit harder than adults (25 and older) in the immediate crisis and risk bearing higher longer-term economic and social costs2. The attention of the impact bond is to address the youth employment crisis and specifically that for young women.The focus on women in the SIB is an urgent response to the negative impact of the pandemic on women and employment. Women were eight times more likely to lose jobs during the national lockdown than men. Women made up 24% of the workforce before the pandemic, yet accounted for 28% of all job losses as the pandemic took hold4.In addition, India has the lowest female labour force participation in South Asia at 20.3%5 and current outcomes of skilling for them are highly inadequate. Out of every 100 women enrolled in skilling programmes, only 10 stay in post-skilling jobs for three months or more.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nsdc-launches-skill-impact-bond/articleshow/87310548.cms

Lack of","AHMEDABAD: The mass exodus of migrant workers during the lockdown, and after it, sparked an unprecedented labour shortage across industries in the state. Lack of skilled workers brought labourintensive jobs to a standstill or slowed them to a snail’s pace, adversely affecting production. During such times, Ahmedabadbased startup, Keepsake Automation, which helped mechanize cutting and welding processes, came to the manufacturing industry’s rescue.Manan Bateriwala, founder, Keepsake Automation, said, “Welding and cutting are two inevitable processes not just in the metals sector but also in heavy engineering and manufacturing set-ups. Being highly labouroriented, these processes were impacted due to the pandemicinduced labourer shortage. Our startup addresses this issue by providing automated technology for welding and cutting.”“We have developed a control system using which one can build a special-purpose machine. The machine, which is an Internet of Things (IOT)-enabled system, not just automates these processes with precision but also helps attain consistency in quality,”added Bateriwala.The startup, which is currently incubated at the Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII), also received a prototype development grant of Rs 10 lakh from the government of Gujarat, in 2019.Post pandemic, the company has bagged various orders and is currently catering to divisions of Larsen and Toubro (L&T), besides other government projects and MSMEs in the engineering, heavy engineering, oil and gas, vessel and shell manufacturing, defence and metals sector.“Given the worker shortage, companies are using semi-automated and automated systems for better productivity and consistent quality as well as for keeping costs under check,” said Bateriwala, a computer engineering graduate, who later joined his family business in specialized welding, when he realized the need for automation in certain industrial processes and thus went on to start his own venture.The startup was founded in 2017 and has an assembly facility at Gota area of Ahmedabad and operates with a team of 11 persons, including research and development teams and on-site professionals.“At present, we’re catering to companies within India, and going forward, we are looking to expand overseas as well,” he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-startups-tech-helps-solve-labour-gap/articleshow/80079665.cms

Two persons had died in the building collapse.Police said that during investigation in the accidental death case, it was revealed that L&T had laid down safety norms while handing over the contract to the scrap trading company. “The company had asked them to keep all safety equipment handy for the workers and conduct demolition only in the presence of an expert. Neither of these instructions was followed,” said sub-inspector D V Chaudhary, who became the complainant in the case.On October 19 last year, the administrator Ejaz had told the demolition machine operator to start breaking the pillars on the ground floor due to which the building came down. “We have arrested all three partners of the scrap trading company, but the administrator is still on the run,” said investigating officer D M Rabari, sub-inspector at Fatehgunj police station.Two labourers Kaiful Pathan and Abdul Wahid had died and around 11 persons were injured in the incident.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/three-of-scrap-trading-firm-held-after-8-months/articleshow/76363313.cms

L&T has so far acquired 28.90 per cent stake in Mindtree and the open offer, if fully subscribed, will take its shareholding in the IT company to about 60 per cent.  In all, the infrastructure major is eyeing about 66 per cent stake in Mindtree for over Rs 10,700 crore -- a mix of recent stake acquisition from Cafe Coffee Day owner, the ongoing open market transactions and the ensuing open offer.  The open offer is slated to commence on June 17 and close on June 28, according to the letter of offer by L&T. In March, L&T had mounted a hostile takeover bid on Mindtree after entering into a deal to buy Cafe Coffee Day owner V G Siddhartha's 20.32 per cent stake in the Bengaluru-based firm and also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15 per cent of the company shares from the open market. ""Larsen and Toubro makes a cash offer of Rs 980 per fully paid up equity share of the face value of Rs 10 each, to acquire up to 5,13,25,371 equity shares representing 31 per cent of the voting share capital ... to the shareholders of Mindtree Ltd,"" said the letter of offer communicated to the BSE by Mindtree Ltd. At Rs 980 apiece for 5,13,25,371 shares (31 per cent stake), L&T will have to shell out about Rs 5,029.8 crore for the planned open offer. The open offer price is higher than Mindtree's closing price of Rs 969 at BSE on Friday. L&T's open offer was earlier scheduled to begin on May 14 but got delayed as the engineering major was awaiting nod from the Securities and Exchange Board of India. According to the schedule drawn up, the deadline for dispatch of the Letter of Offer to the shareholders of Mindtree is June 8, while the last date by which a committee of independent directors of Mindtree is required to give its recommendation to shareholders on the offer, is June 13. The deadline for upward revision of the offer price or the offer size is June 14. The acquisition is expected to be ""value accreting"" for both the L&T's and Mindtree's shareholders in the medium to long term, the filing said. ""The target company is expected to operate as an independent company within the Larsen & Toubro Group in the short to medium term. The board of directors of the target company may recommend consolidation of the target company with other entities in the Larsen & Toubro Group, which may be given effect to after obtaining the necessary approvals under applicable law,"" it added.  L&T said the open offer is being made after it acquired 3.33 crore shares, aggregating up to 20.15 per cent of Mindtree share capital from V G Siddhartha, Coffee Day Trading Ltd and Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd for Rs 980 apiece, totalling Rs 3,269 crore.  Also, another 2.48 crore shares aggregating up to 15 per cent shareholding is to be acquired by way of a purchase order placed with stock broker Axis Capital Ltd on March 18 for Rs 2,434 crore. L&T said Mindtree acquisition is in line with its strategy to grow the revenue and profit of its asset-light services business portfolio.  Mindtree's net profit grew 32.2 per cent to Rs 754.1 crore in 2018-19 while revenue was up 28.5 per cent to Rs 7,021.5 crore from the previous fiscal. The company has been under the media and investor spotlight for months now - first on account of the takeover drama that unfolded earlier this year and more recently when Mindtree's board in mid-April proposed to pay a special dividend to shareholders, including promoters, that along with regular dividend and tax components would strip the mid-sized IT firm of about Rs 530 crore.

Comprising two units of 700 MW each at Rajpura, the plant was set up by L&T. In July 2020, it has completed six years of operations with high-efficiency, high-reliability, and social and environmental benefits.   Under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), all the power NPL generates is supplied to Punjab, accounting for over a quarter of the State’s power requirements. It is the cost-effective, most efficient and reliable source of power among all the TPPs in the State. Apart from providing electricity, the NPL is a source of direct and indirect employment to 3,000 people and contributes significantly to the revenue generation for the State of Punjab.   The Rajpura TPP of NPL has been delivering consistent top-notch performance and is a socially and environmentally conscientious organisation too.    Top Performance  Over the last six years, it has supplied close to 47,500 MU of power to PSPCL and 8,314 MU in FY20 – the highest of all TPPs in the State. While the thermal power plants in India operate at an average PLF (Plant Load Factor) of 55%, Nabha Power runs at a high PLF of 73% and during peak paddy season it operates at a PLF of close to 100%. High equipment reliability and best maintenance practices enable the plant to generally achieve 100% availability and with shutdown requirements for repair and maintenance activities, averages over 85% availability, year after year. This speaks volumes of the state-of-the-art Japanese supercritical technology and efficient plant operations.   NPL achieved its best-ever heat rate of 2281 kcal/KWh in FY20 and lowest auxiliary consumption of 5.06% in FY 20, best figures among the TPP’s in the State of Punjab. The CERC benchmarks for similar capacity plants are 2350 Kcal/Kwh and 5.75% for Aux consumption.    A slew of awards affirms NPL’s consistently high productivity:   National Energy Leader Award, CII, 2019, 2020 Excellent Energy Efficiency Unit Award, CII, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 Best IPP Award for 3 consecutive years by IPPAI Finalist in Global Platts Energy Excellence Award, S&P, USA, 2019 High Efficiency and Sustainability Leadership, Peabody, USA, 2019 Best Coal Based Operational Plant, Power Magazine USA, 2018 National Energy Conservation Award, BEE, MoP – GoI, 2017   A Social Conscience  When the lockdown was imposed in Punjab in March, it was a critical period for Rajpura TPP, as Unit-1 Capital Overhaul was underway. But it was operational 24x7 during COVID-19 lockdown and generated 49 Million Units before Unit-2 was asked to go under reserve shutdown. With over 1800 personnel coming to the plant, NPL acted proactively to arrange for smooth movement of labour and ensured complete safety of staff and workers.   NPL’s CSR wing distributed over 40,000 masks to employees, contract workers, local administration and police personnel. Grocery & food items were distributed to more than 4000 BPL families in 49 villages in the vicinity of the plant. Twice a week, the labour colonies were completely sanitized by the company.   As a responsible corporate, NPL has undertaken many initiatives for the benefit of the environment. Over 20,000 trees have been planted and are nurtured on the 9 km road connecting the plant with NH7 and in nearby villages. Last year, NPL planted 50,000 plants within its premises in record time.   Forward to the Future  NPL has provision for capacity addition of third unit of 700 MW, thereby equipping Punjab to be able to draw more power from the expanded TPP in the future. NPL’s Rajpura TPP will continue to play a critical role in the supply of electricity to Punjab, and help the State reach closer to achieving its economic and social objectives.        <p style=""font-style:italic; border-bottom:0 font-size: 15px;"">Disclaimer: Content Produced by Larsen & Toubro</p>",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nabha-power-at-the-forefront-of-providing-cost-effective-electricity-with-ace-tech-high-efficiency-social-benefits/articleshow/78099456.cms

Earlier officials said they may opt for ballasted tracks for the depot to cut cost and ballastless tracks for operation of trains on the mainline.A metrorail official said work on phase-2 had slowed down due Covid-induced nationwide lockdown last year and the state assembly elections this year. “But we had been working on getting the paperwork ready during the lockdown period. The work has also been delayed due to the model code of conduct that was in place during the assembly elections. We do not want any further delays,” an official said.CMRL recently awarded four construction contracts to three companies. It included two contracts for construction of a portion of corridor-4. Officials said contracts will begin pre-construction work like soil investigation and other surveys if required in a month.Corridor-4 links many of the city’s core localities like Marina Beach, Mylapore, Nandanam, T Nagar, Kodambakkam, Vadapalani and Saligramam with the IT hub at Porur and west Chennai localities like Chennai bypass crossing, Iyyappanthangal bus depot, Katuipakkam, Karayan Chavadi and Poonamallee, which are otherwise poorly connected by public transport.On corridor-4, Larsen & Toubro was awarded a contract to build a 7.9km elevated line from Power House in Kodambakkam to Porur junction with nine stations within a period of 2.9 years and Hindustan Construction-KEC International Consortium was given a contract to build 7.9km elevated line with nine stations from Chennai bypass crossing to Poonamallee bypass in three years.“The companies will have to complete the formalities of signing the contract within 28 days and begin work after that. So, we can expect some work to begin after 28 days, but mobilising manpower and bigger machinery may take some time,” an official said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/work-to-begin-on-part-of-metro-rail-phase-2/articleshow/83026006.cms

The conglomerate - Mediawire","90400239Larsen & Toubro (L&T), one of India's leading engineering and construction companies, has always been committed to creating a safe and healthy workplace for its employees. The conglomerate has been taking this commitment a step further by aiming to become a ‘Zero Harm’ company. What does this mean for about 50,000 L&T employees, over 2 lakh workmen hustling across 800-plus project sites, 13 manufacturing campuses and multiple offices across 30 countries?It means that L&T is doing everything possible to prevent accidents and injuries from happening at workplaces. This includes implementing rigorous safety procedures and training programs, constantly monitoring and improving workplace safety standards, as well as harnessing new age technologies for SMART applications. All, L&T work sites are certified under ISO 45001.Mr. S N Subrahmanyan, CEO & MD, L&T shares his thoughts about ensuring Zero Harm at L&T workplaces, “Safety will not take root if it is only top-driven; it must be bottom-up too, with the widespread realization that everyone needs to get home safe every single day. Create an attitude of safety, not just procedures. Watch your back and those of your colleagues and co-workers too. Do it right. Do it safely. Do it every time.”Managing Safety ‘Top-down and Bottom-Up’Within L&T, with the widespread realization that everyone needs to get home safe every single day, an EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) Council was formulated set up to ensure that the Board of Directors is fully apprised of the implementation and direction of L&T’s Health and Safety Policy across the Group.The EHS Council undertakes periodic review of all incidents and provides guidance to proactively manage risks and focus on resources to prevent any accident or incident.The corporate EHS Policy of the company demonstrates its commitment to an accident-free workplace along with the management framework to be deployed across businesses. It has deployed EHS teams at every site which work in tandem with project site teams, with the objective of implementing industry-leading safety practices to achieve ‘Zero Harm’. To stay relevant, the policy is periodically reviewed by Mr. Subramanian Sarma, Whole-time Director and Chairman of the EHS Council, and the senior management.The Connected Workman & Digital EHS InitiativesThe firm’s ultimate digital vision is that of the connected workman. Sensors and beacons on the workmen can detect altitude, temperature and other environmental conditions and monitor vitals such as heartbeat, pulse rate, blood pressure and fatigue. Various AI models and methods can generate suitable alerts in real time to prevent incidents. Work in this area is at an experimental stage as L&T strives to find the best solutions in the near future. In a the quest to achieve its ‘Zero Harm’ objective, L&T firmly places digitalization at the heart of safety.The ‘BIM for Safety’ initiative is transforming the way EHS functions. BIM comprises 3D-models embedded with data and information, and has been an excellent platform to share resources and improve co-ordination. This path-breaking technology is used to enhance safety at work sites through identification and mitigation of risks, resulting in a paradigm shift in EHS performance.Good safety begins with awareness and training, and L&T is using innovative digital technologies to impart such training to its workmen. L&T has developed films using Immersive Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to demonstrate safety practices covering multiple scenarios like working at heights, material handling, heavy vehicle management, working at excavation sites, working with HT lines, safety barricading, work permits and working in a marine environment.To ensure consistent compliance with safety processes, the Safety App in use at all its project sites has digitized safety processes like safe-to-start, pre-start inspections, near-miss and incident reporting and rectification. The data from this app enables online real-time reviews of safety, and analytics on this data enable trends and patterns to be identified for effective rectification actions and improvements.Leading the wayL&T has developed a robust online safety training module which familiarizes workmen with safety requirements. As workmen come from different parts of the country, this interactive online training module is available in several Indian languages. This ensures that there is standardization in the way different parts of the business at different locations in the country adhere to on-time delivery of various products and services. A culture of safety emerging out of action on several fronts, including management time devoted to all aspects of safety, augment customer satisfaction.To support education and training with a special focus on helping workmen become specialists in areas of interest, L&T has set up academies across the length and breadth of the country. L&T has won several accolades for Safety from the RoSPA and British Safety Council. However, the biggest award will be to have ‘Zero Harm’ across L&T’s businesses, with on-time performance, and without compromising on complete customer satisfaction.      <p style=""font-style:italic; border-bottom:0 font-size: 15px;"">Disclaimer: Content Produced by L&T</p>",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lts-focus-on-zero-harm-aided-by-tech-ehs-policies-and-commitment/articleshow/90400241.cms

Three month,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (Mhada) could save Rs 250 crore if it replaces transit tenements with rehab flats at Worli. Three months back MHADA began laying the foundation for three transit buildings at Worli, which will take at least three years to complete. Saving time and preventing cost-escalation has now forced the authority to relook at one of its most ambitious housing projects in the city.The transit tenements are being constructed on open spaces within Worli BDD chawl complex. Constructing rehab flats, rather than transit tenements, is being considered along with other issues, that are proving to be hurdles in redevelopment of BDD chawls at Worli, Naigaum in Dadar and at N M Joshi Marg, Lower Parel.A committee comprising Mhada vice-president, chief engineer (roads), public works department and chief officer (Mumbai Board) is discussing how to speed up the redevelopment.Yogesh Mhase, chief officer (Mumbai Board), said redevelopment is moving at a very slow pace and work must be speeded up. While Worli BDD, the largest cluster with 121 chawls, is estimated to take 10 years for redevelopment, Naigaum and N M Joshi are expected to take at least eight years. In the case of Naigaum, the contractor, Larsen & Toubro, had even served a termination notice as MHADA in three years failed to complete the eligibility survey and to hand over vacant land to the contractor to begin construction.“The government is keen the project is completed in five years,” said Mhase. He said deciding eligibility was crucial as government had promised a free 500 sq ft flat to eligible tenants, and is one of the biggest stumbling blocks. The promise of a free flat has led to disputes within families, often resulting in violence and police cases. The committee will also decide if the cut-off date for eligibility for commercial units can be extended beyond June 2017.The committee is also considering a multi-level car park, rather than three-level basement parking, as it would reduce maintenance costs. Mhada promised to bear maintenance costs for 10 years for the rehab buildings.The committee, meeting everyday, will submit recommendations to the government by January 10.Mhase said changes that will be proposed by the committee will be within the framework of the contract signed. “The process of deciding eligibility for phase I is on. Shifting of eligible tenants has been delayed on account of Covid-19 and is unlikely for 3-4 months. This process of consultation does not impact work currently under way,” he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mhada-can-save-rs-250cr-if-it-replaces-transit-tenements-with-rehab-flats-at-worli/articleshow/80193249.cms

The NHSRCL has already awarded work for 237km of viaduct between Vapi and Vadodara in Gujarat including 4 elevated stations namely Vapi, Billimora, Surat and Bharuch and one train depot at Surat.The Ahmedabad-Vadodara contract which is also for elevated corridor involves the design and construction of civil and building works including testing and commissioning for Double Line High Speed Railway involving 87.5km of Viaducts and bridges, 25 crossing bridges and a tunnel, 97.50km of roads, one station, a maintenance depot, 4 sub-maintenance depots, and other associated structures.The project is being financed by JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency). The other bidders for this package were the Tata Projects-J Kumar Infrastructure Projects Ltd-NCC Ltd. and AFCONS Infrastructure Ltd.-Ircon International-JMC Projects consortiums.With this the NHRSCL has awarded the contract for the majority of the portion in the state of Gujarat. Officials said that the NHSRCL, the nodal agency implementing the 508km corridor, will award the contract to L&T soon even for the Ahmedabad-Vadodara section and has set a deadline of 48 months for the work from the date of issue of work order.

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa will flag off the work between Cantonment and Shivajinagar stations at 10.30am.The much-delayed section saw several hurdles, including land acquisition issues, alignment changes, Covid-19 pandemic, lockdown and India-China standoff even before the complicated process of tunnelling through congested CBD areas could begin. BMRCL had changed the corridor’s colour from red to pink.Four giant TBMs, including Avni (earth), Urja (energy), Lavi (lion) and Vindhya (knowledge), will drill and cut through central business district areas between Vellara Junction and Pottery Town (5.5km).

Tunnel shafts, which will be used to lower the machines, were created at Shivajinagar and Cantonment stations.“The tunnelling process is finally kicking off after several obstacles. First, it was land acquisition and then delay in arrival of TBMs from China because of Covid-19. This was followed by visa restrictions for Chinese engineers to assemble these machines and shortage of workers due to lockdown. In fact, tunnelling was supposed to start in March 2020 but was delayed due to the pandemic,” said a senior BMRCL official.The TBMs are expected to tunnel 2.5-5 metres per day, depending on the geographical condition they encounter. BMRCL has set 2024 as the deadline for commissioning of the underground section. It took about five years to complete the 10km tunnelling work during Phase I.BMRCL said nine TBMs will be deployed along the 14-km section.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-after-hurdles-tunnelling-for-pink-line-starts-on-thursday/articleshow/77254382.cms

On Tuesday at 9pm, L&T had unilaterally withdrawn access to the CCTV cameras for cops and civic authorities over pending payment issues. The access was restored on Thursday at 7pm.City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who had written a strong letter to NMC and Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL), had been taken aback by the abrupt decision of the private service provider to deny access to CCTV cameras. This was barely two hours after his meeting with the top L&T officials on Tuesday. 84062302The meeting had discussed upgrading the CCTV software further and installing 64 unused CCTV cameras at Kalamna and Hudkeshwar. Soon afterwards, that the top cop got the message from the L&T official about their decision to withdraw access over an unresolved payment issue.As the top brass started alerting police stations to remain on toes, especially near vital installations and sensitive locations, three major incidents took place in the city on Wednesday where investigations were hampered in the absence of CCTV access. A 69-year-old woman was robbed at Pandey Layout, and some armed robbers attacked a family at Pardi. The third case was of two ATM thieves decamping with cash Rs3.65 lakh from a Central Avenue bank. This incident was old, but cops could not access CCTV footage when they got a complaint about it on Wednesday.The CP said such an abrupt decision to withdraw access had serious implications on the law and order, safety and security of citizens, Covid management and enforcement of the lockdown. “City police have taken a strict view about this arm-twisting measure by the private operator. This was certainly not the way to resolve a grievance, by threatening security of the city and citizens,” he said.Meanwhile, a day after L&T stopped streaming videos to the Command and Control Centre, NSSCDCL served legal notice to it for breach of service conditions, said chief executive officer Buvneshwari S. The CEO also told TOI that the firm had stalled screening of video footage by sending a letter of suspension of service for want of payments.Buvneshwari said NSSCDCL has no outstanding of payments. “We have already paid our payment of Rs103 crore in advance. NSSCDCL has no shortage of funds for the projects it launched in the city,” she said.A L&T representative refused to comment but said the service provider would follow the guidelines of the court and its orders.Sources said the firm has to recover over Rs150 crore from department of information technology and home department. According to sources, the home department has not paid its dues of Rs68 crore, while DIT has defaulted on around Rs100 crore. The NSSCDCL CEO said just video on system was off and Command and Control centre was shut, but surveillance system across the city was continuing. “Cameras installed at important squares, roads, WiFi service etc were all on but our access to video footage was cut off,” she claimed.

If the buyer wishes to withdraw from the project, the builder is liable to return the amount received by him for the apartment, plot or building as the case may be, with interest, the Act states. And if the buyer wishes to continue in the project, the builder has to pay “an interest for every month of delay, till handing over of the possession”.Chatterjee, in his order, said: “Simple present tense used in the starting line of Section 18 clearly indicates that the provision shall apply only till the project is incomplete or the promoter is unable to give possession. Once the project is complete or possession is given, the provision ceases to operate.” He ‘advised’ the Serraos to take possession of the flat and make a balance payment.Counsel for Serraos, Basil Menezes, said they were to make requisite payment when the builder on July 31, 2018, asked them to pay an additional Rs 10.85 lakh since the flat’s carpet area had increased by 127 sq ft. No explanation or physical examination over the increase was provided, said the Serraos.But the order stated that increase in carpet area and price “being covered in agreement for sale, cannot be termed breach of agreement” and directed the builder to provide a certificate for the added area.Advocate Anil Dsouza, secretary of the Bar Association of MahaRERA Advocates, said “the now famous case of Suresh Swamy v Larsen & Toubro in February 2019 was a landmark order on the sanctity of the possession date as per the registered agreement”. “We had filed the Serraos case too and will explore options to file an appeal against this order,” he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/flat-buyers-cant-seek-relief-for-delay-after-project-ready-maharera/articleshow/79313574.cms

He, however, did not divulge the reason for the cave-in.The incident has added to residents’ worries. “It happened on Thursday night. We heard a noise after the road caved in. Following this, BMRCL engineers arrived and used three trucks of concrete overnight to fill this sinkhole. There are several old buildings in this area. We are now worried about our safety,” said a shopkeeper.Larsen & Toubro is responsible for the section from Vellara Junction to Pottery Town. BMRCL along with L&T has deployed TBMs Avni, Urja, Lavi and Vindhya on this section. Of them, Avni, Urja and Vindhya have started tunnelling.In September, a 10ft sinkhole appeared above the tunnel bored by Avni at Shivajinagar Metro station. However, BMRCL maintained no damage was reported to the TBM.“The expected geology in this tunnel section is about 250m in hard rock, 350m in mixed-ground conditions and about 255m in soil,” a BMRCL release had said during commencement of tunnelling work for the 855-metre corridor between Cantonment and Shivajinagar Metro station in July.As boring tunnels are fraught with challenges, soil tests were conducted before and during the tunnelling, and instruments were fixed to gauge settling of soil and study cracks on buildings. Work on the city’s longest underground Metro corridor — between Dairy Circle and Nagawara (14km-Phase 2) is now progressing. This phase of Metro tunnelling is likely to be more challenging as the TBMs will pass through densely populated areas and there are concerns about safety of old buildings in areas like Shivajinagar.The TBMs will tunnel 2.5-5 metres per day, depending on the geographical condition they encounter.

The accident happened on February 12 at the construction site of the Dwarka Expressway near pillar 16 on Pataudi Road.When TOI visited the spot, the workers there said it was the fourth such accident since December last year. Officials in the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said they had sought a report from the contractor, Larsen & Toubro.The 13-second video, uploaded on Twitter, shows the 50-tonne iron girder and concrete girder being lifted with cables. A few seconds later, the girder comes off the hooks and crashes onto the ground. While three of the four construction workers hang from the cables, one who was on the girder falls with it. No one was injured in the accident.The workers said the impact of the fall was such that the girder developed cracks and had to be made again. The 29km expressway, which will connect Dwarka in Delhi with Gurugram, is being constructed under the Bharatmala Project. Almost 19km of the expressway is in Haryana while 10km in Delhi. A few days ago, Union minister Nitin Gadkari had said the entire expressway would be completed by August next year.“It was around 4pm on February 12, when we were pulling up the girder through the winch machine. There was a sudden jerk and the girder fell off the chains. Three people were holding on to the cables and hanging in the air while one fell with the concrete structure,” a worker said.“Senior officials found that the gear box of the machine had failed and smoke had started to come out of the motor,” he added. The worker claimed that a similar accident had taken place at the site in January while two others had occurred in December last year. NHAI officials dubbed the accident a result of mechanical failure. “Preliminary observation had suggested that there could have been a technical issue while placing the girders, which caused the tensions on the rope and the harness attached to the workers to oscillate. There was neither any injury or casualty, nor did the structure sustain any damage. However, the contractor will have to submit a report to us about the accident and the safety measures taken at the project site. If lapses are found, appropriate action will be taken,” an NHAI official said.L&T has claimed that the workers had sufficient safety gear to avert any unfortunate incident. “Mechanical issues can occur while carrying out such heavy construction work. That is why we try to ensure that our safety measures are well in place. In the video, we can see that due to a sudden jerk caused during launching of the girder, the harness starts to swing a little. But, workers had all the gear in place to avoid any injury and avert an untoward situation. We’ll submit the details of the accident to NHAI soon,” said an L&T official.(With inputs from Siddharth Tiwari)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/video-shows-girder-falling-at-dwarka-expressway-site-workers-clinging-to-cables/articleshow/81500470.cms

The collector’s office tried to organise a survey of tenants in October but shelved it after local BJP MLA Kalidas Kolambhkar sought a postponement, Mhada sources said. MHADA is the nodal agency for the project and is now owner of chawl land at Naigaum, Worli and N M Joshi Marg. Political interference has resulted in a stalemate. Local Congress leaders have opposed the project from the beginning, while BJP has been pushing for it. Mhada sources said the company, after waiting for long, in July served a termination notice. “It bagged a major contract from Cidco, where it got a vacant plot, and work has started. It does not make economic sense for them to wait indefinitely here for the government to do a survey and shift tenants,” said the source. The former chief officer did try to persuade L&T to stay for at least a year, but the company was firm about the termination.It had provided a Rs 120-crore bank guarantee while government paid Rs 10 crore as it was a cash contract. “Once we accept the termination, we shall settle accounts and focus on carrying out a survey of eligible tenants. We have permission but will not appoint a contractor till eligibility is decided,” said an official.Mhada had tentatively planned to build four sale buildings with 60 floors each at Naigaum. It had also proposed a 20-storey commercial building besides 20 buildings with 19-23 floors to house tenants of Naigaum chawls.TIMESVIEW: The Naigaum BDD redevelopment fiasco exemplifies how a project goes wrong in the absence of government support. Since it involved the sensitive issue of housing and rehabilitation, state agencies should have hammered out a consensus among residents before inviting bids or roping in a contractor.

Infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has already approached market regulator Sebi seeking approval for launching a share buyback programme. The offer is likely to open soon.  ""The government will participate in the buy back process. The shares would be tendered on proportionate basis,"" an official told .  The government currently holds 1.8 per cent stake in L&T through the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI).  The share buy back price has been fixed at Rs 1,475 a piece.  ""At this price the government is likely to get around Rs 700 crore by tendering shares in the buy back offer,"" the official said, adding over 49 lakh shares held by SUUTI in L&T are likely to be bought back.  When contacted, L&T spokesperson declined to comment on the story.  Shares of L&T closed at Rs 1,425.15, up 1.77 per cent over previous close on the BSE.  The government had sold 2.5 per cent stake in L&T held through SUUTI in 2017 through block deals in the market. After that, some portion of SUUTI holding in L&T has been transferred to Bharat-22 ETF.  The proceeds from buy back would help the government move forward in achieving the Rs 80,000 crore disinvestment target set for current fiscal.  The government has already mopped up over Rs 32,000 crore through minority stake sale in CPSEs and launching ETFs.

Engineers of Larsen & Toubro, key agency for temple construction, will aid the two premier tech institutes, the trust said.Setting a deadline of 36-40 months for completion of the temple, the Ram Janambhoomi Teerath Kshetra Trust in a series of tweets emphasised that iron won’t be used in construction and copper plates will bind the marble blocks. The plates should be 18inch long, 30mm wide and 3mm in depth. “At least 10,000 such plates may be required,” the trust said, while appealing to Ram Bhakts to donate copper plates.Also, donors can engrave family names, place of origin or names of community temples on these plates. “This way, copper plates will not only symbolise unity, but will be testimony to the nation’s contribution to mandir construction,” said the trust, which is also in possession of soil and water brought from hundreds of villages and rivers across India. The trust tweeted details of bank accounts where people can make donations, amid Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) plans to reach out to 3 lakh villages and 700 cities across the country to crowd-fund the project.The move to rope in CBRI and IIT-Madras comes days after the construction committee headed by PM Modi’s former principal secretary, Nripendra Mishra surveyed the site, followed by the drawing of a blueprint for temple complex straddling 69 acres.This also comes close on heels of the trust deciding to alter the original plan of the temple by raising dimensions and number of domes. The trust had decided to increase the height from 128ft to 160ft, while also announcing construction of five domes instead of three as was proposed during the temple movement.The trust said, construction would be done by imbibing Vedic technology to shield the structure from natural calamities, including earthquakes and have a life span of 1,000 years.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ram-temple-to-be-completed-in-over-3-yrs-cbri-iit-m-roped-in/articleshow/77664684.cms

The company said the fire broke out in the 36-inch gas pipeline which is part of the 240-km long pipeline network from Bombay High. There was no casualty or injury to any person, the company said.The blaze could be seen from several kilometres away and people came out of the houses to record videos that became viral on social media.Three blasts happened at around 3 am.Hazira facility receives gas from ONGC's Bassein field off the west coast as well as from Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields. It was handling some 32-33 million standard cubic meters of gas per day. It is India's largest gas-processing facility and a critical supplier of the fuel to domestic industries that receive gas from the Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) trunkline. The HVJ trunkline is the country's largest and runs from Hazira in the west to Jagdishpur in northern India.Sources said that three fire tenders of the Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) fire and emergency department were rushed to the ONGC plant for bringing the blaze under control, even as the oil and gas major’s own fire fighting vehicles had already started the exercise to douse the fire. The gas leakage resulted in foul smell in about 15 sq km area, said fire officials. In some of the areas including Magdalla, Ichhapore, Hazira, Dumas, Piplod, Adajan, residents experienced tremors due to the multiple blasts.All the 24 terminals in the ONGC’s Hazira plant were immediately shut down. The supply of gas to the other industrial units in Hazira including Reliance, KRIBHCO, GAIL, Larsen & Toubro, GSPC, GSEB was suspended for few hours. In a statement, DM Roy, group general manager of ONGC Hazira Plant stated that small and moderate fire broke out in the 36-inch gas line coming from offshore at Hazira plant due to the leakage of gas from the pipeline. “This led to actuation of emergency alarm systems and shutdown of the plant,” he added.

Members of several bungalow societies have been expressing opposition to the move, which they fear will eat into their small bungalow plots.“The widening proposal pertains to 335 roads. A major policy decision like this should have been given wide publicity. The PMC’s publicity was inadequate and it is now refusing to entertain our objections on the ground that we filed the applications after the deadline. This is not acceptable,” said S Padmanabhan, independent director of the Pune Smart City Development Corporation and a former IAS officer. “Besides, the PMC has not given us any explanation on what basis the access roads meant only for our bungalow colony were shortlisted for widening. No traffic survey report has been made available to us,” said Padmanabhan, who is a resident of the Vishrambag Cooperative Housing Society off Senapati Bapat Road.Ashwin Panemangalore, former vice-president of Larsen & Toubro Limited, said, “In Vishrambag, the PMC only pasted the map and that too only recently. How am I supposed to know that it pertains to the road widening proposal?”After the issue was highlighted by the TOI, Panemangalore searched the PMC website and wrote to it saying: “There are many unclear maps with no details of areas pertaining to Shivajinagar. It has taken me several days of research on the PMC website to understand if I am an affected party.”Vishrambag Cooperative Housing Society chairman Lt Col Sureshkumar Rege (retd) told TOI, “Our society’s general body meeting has decided to move court if the PMC fails to give us a hearing.” He said the Vishrambag Cooperative Housing Society has communicated to the PMC that none of the 41 property owners “is interested in getting the Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) and the additional Floor Space Index (FSI) to be offered after widening of the three lanes within the society”. In his objection letter to the PMC, Rege said, “Our general body and managing committee meetings have unanimously resolved that we prefer a quiet and tranquil environment, and not the TDR.”Padmanabhan said, “Our society bylaws categorically state that no high-rises should be constructed. The PMC should read the Gujarat high court judgment of 2019. The order categorically states that if the housing society bylaws impose such a cap, it must be honoured.” ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/citizens-wonder-why-the-hush-hush-rush-by-civic-body-to-widen-roads/articleshow/81078384.cms

Work on the 10.6 km road started in 2018.""Despite the lockdown, 17% of the work has been completed and we have spent Rs 1,281 crore - the highest so far on construction of the coastal road,"" said municipal commissioner I S Chahal. The Rs 8,429-crore project will comprise a pedestrian promenade, which will be 7.7km long, stretching from Priyadarshini Park to Haji Ali and from Haji Ali to Worli.The BMC-appointed contractor Larsen & Toubro is now busy assembling the tunnel boring machine (TBM) that arrived in 100 dismantled parts in April. Owing to India-China tensions, there were difficulties in finding Chinese engineers to assemble the TBM, the longest and largest to ever be used in India. It will be ready by December 15 for drilling through Malabar Hill to create an underground link between Priyadarshini Park and Girgaum Chowpatty.The Supreme Court in October reserved final orders on the project while indicating it would not vacate its December 2019 interim order allowing reclamation strictly for the construction of the road and for no other purpose. The high court had put a stay on the work on grounds of lack of environmental clearances.The 10.6 km coastal road stretch is the first phase of the project and will extend from Girgaum Chowpatty till the Worli-end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. It will comprise an eight-lane road on reclaimed land, bridges, elevated roads and a tunnel stretch at its southern end.According to Vijay Nigot, in-charge of the coastal road project, it will have three interchanges at Amarsons (4 lanes), Haji Ali (8 lanes) and Worli (6 lanes). These interchanges will together stretch over 15.5km. At the Amarsons interchange, one arm will lead towards the sea link, two to Amarsons junction and a third towards Nariman Point. Similarly, at Haji Ali, the interchange will have eight arms, including ones leading towards the sea link and Nariman Point.The project includes underground parking at four places, the largest being at Haji Ali, with a provision for parking 1,200 cars. At Worli and Amarsons, parking has been planned for 200 cars each. A depot for a Bus Rapid Transit System has also been planned at Worli.Recently, the BMC invited tenders for the rehabilitation of fisherfolk at Worli and Haji Ali, who have been affected by the coastal road project. Environmentalists and the fishing community have criticised the BMC for a belated survey which they said should have been done prior to work starting on the project.

Sources said Dholpur stone will be largely used like that of the existing Parliament and in some interior portions, red granite may be used in place of the red sandstone. “This will be a building with most modern facilities but displaying our culture and tradition,” said an official.This is the first construction project of the government’s mega plan of redevelopment of Central Vista. TOI on November 3 had first published the full design of the Central Vista redevelopment plan, which included a new PM’s residence and Vice-President House on two sides of the President’s House. As per the bid document, the construction work of the new Parliament won’t have any impact on holding of sessions in existing Parliament.Sources said the preparation for getting necessary approvals for the other components of the overall project, including construction of new office complexes along Rajpath, would start after December.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tatas-set-to-bag-new-parliament-building-project-with-lowest-862-crore-bid/articleshow/78157565.cms

The decision on whether to accept or reject it will be taken by the empowered committee of secretaries, said state officials.The housing department is worried the Worli and N M Joshi Marg BDD chawl redevelopment projects may meet with a similar fate as there too no construction has started yet.In case of N M Joshi Marg, though, 10 chawls that are to be taken up for redevelopment have been surveyed and 607 tenants have been found to be eligible; the process is underway for the others.“Around 269 residents have also been shifted to transit tenements in the nearby mill areas,” said a Mhada official.Sources said they have received massive cooperation from tenants of the Worli BDD chawls. “So far, we have surveyed 1,120 tenants and found 762 eligible. We were to sign agreements for transit tenements but it has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said an official.Local activist Raju Waghmare said Mhada should take up construction under 33(5) of the Development Control Rules applicable to Mhada buildings as the land has already been handed over to it. “If that is done, then residents will get homes measuring as much as 680 square feet,” he said.Mhada officials alleged residents are being instigated to oppose the public project as there is a certain section that wants private developers to take over the project. “A majority of the tenants are in favour of the project. They must come together and openly support it. We are providing tenants 500-sq-ft homes as against the current 160-sq-ft tenements, besides other amenities. The project will become economically unviable if tenants keep making unfeasible demands.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/naigaum-bdd-residents-want-lt-to-revive-redevelopment-project/articleshow/77863347.cms

We are ready to bear their expenses. They can return to their houses once the work is over. We are taking all steps to prevent any loss of life or damage to buildings,” he said, adding they will decide whether to raze the structures or repair them based on the extent of damage caused by tunneling work.In October, a road caved in but no casualty or damage was reported.

This is part of the city’s longest underground Metro corridor — between Dairy Circle and Nagawara (14km, Phase 2).Sources said BMRCL along with L&T used around 60 tunnel ring segments to complete 80 metres of tunnelling along this section. Water leakage and cracks have been reported in about 25% of the segments on the two tunnels which are being built.“It’s unusual to have water leakage and cracks in Metro tunnels. There should be a thorough investigation to find out whether it is a design fault or poor workmanship. Action should be taken against the contractor for lapses,” said an engineer.Sources in BMRCL and L&T confirmed to have detected the issue. However, BMRCL officials played down the incident. “These are construction challenges and being addressed,” said BMRCL managing director Ajay Seth.Queries sent to L&T did not elicit any response.Four TBMs —Avni, Urja, Lavi and Vindhya —have been deployed on this section. Of them, Avni, Urja and Vindhya have started tunnelling. On Thursday, a portion of Sultanji Gunta Road near Bamboo Bazaar, Shivajinagar, also caved in. Last month, a 10ft sinkhole appeared above the tunnel bored by Avni at Shivajinagar Metro station. Tunnelling by Avni was reportedly disrupted after the incident.Experts say leakage also threatens the safety of operations on underground Metro services. There are several methods like manual inspection, photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning to detect leakage in tunnels.“Water will flow through any opening available — joints, cracks, voids, pores, etc. There are various techniques, materials and technologies available for application, depending on the causes and reasons as well as duration and durability,” said Umesh B Rao, co-founder of Institute for Research Development & Training of Construction Trades & Management.Another civil engineer said: “Tunnel liners with appropriate thickness should be suitably reinforced and anchored. There is a possibility that water will accumulate and seep through the weaker portion of the concrete during heavy rain.”Namma Metro’s Phase 1 underground tunnelling had also faced challenges, including road cave-in incidents, damages and cracks of old buildings.BMRCL MD Ajay Seth said these are construction challenges and being addressed.

Goa State Infrastructure Development Co","PANAJI: Delayed by nearly a year, the second phase of the 103m-bridge linking Patto-Neugi Nagar is nearing completion. Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) officials said that Larsen and Toubro (L&T) is currently constructing the approach roads and will subsequently lay the asphalt.The hotmixing work is likely to commence in the coming fortnight, GSIDC officials said.The bridge serves as a second entry point into the capital and primarily benefits students and teachers of People’s High School, Mary Immaculate Girls High School and Lok Chetna Primary School, as well as residents of the government quarters located in Bhatulem.“Some of the minor utility services are still being shifted but it will be completed soon. The contractor will start laying the bitumen soon and we want to open the bridge by summer,” the official said.Conceptualised by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar as a means to decongest the city and decrease commute for residents of Mala and Bhatulem, the bridge has helped reduced entry into the city by at least 1.5 km, government officers said.However, due to the delay in completing the bridge and the poor condition of the roads, Neugi Nagar junction has become chaotic and dangerous for motorists. Officials said that there is a proposal to create a traffic island at the junction to streamline traffic.Parrikar inaugurated phase I of the bridge over the Rua de Ourem creek in December 2017, while phase II of the bridge was taken up only after the water pipeline adjoining the bridge was dismantled. The pre-stressed bridge is being built at a cost of approximately Rs 25 crore and includes a 1.5m footpath and a utility service duct. Phase I of the project was built for Rs 8.5 crore by L&T.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/2nd-phase-of-neugi-nagar-bridge-nears-completion/articleshow/73396803.cms

As per the bid condition, the successful bidder will need to provide helicopter services from Srinagar to the project site twice a month.The project, earlier awarded in 2017, was terminated after the crisis hit IL&FS. Officials said the work will be awarded this month and will be completed in six years.This is for the first time such a provision to provide helicopter services has been incorporated as in the bidding document of a road project to transport officials and workers to the site. Other infrastructure entities such as in sectors such as oil and gas, power and railways have been using such services to ferry their manpower and equipment.The bid condition to provide helicopter services in the bid document has raised eyebrows considering that highways minister, Nitin Gadkari, had asked the National Highway and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL) to reduce project cost. However, sources said this has been done to ensure that work can continue round the year at the site.The tender document said, “The contractor shall provide the helicopter service within one month from the appointed date.”Sources added that during winter, it would be impossible to take the workforce from one portal of the 14.15 km tunnel to the other end. “The construction period has been reduced to six years from the earlier estimate of seven years considering that the construction can continue round the year. There will be a need to relocate the workforce every 10-15 days because of harsh climatic conditions at site,” an official said.The bi-directional tunnel with an escape tunnel was earlier awarded to IL&FS and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone in May 2018. But IL&FS could not start work and the contract was terminated in January 2019.The project cost has been reduced to Rs 4,400 crore. While the emergency escape tunnel has been done away with, which was estimated to cost Rs 850 crore, the new bid has included widening of the existing 18 km approach road to 10 metres. The NHIDCL has set 2.5 years for completing the approach road, which will also have two tunnels with total length of 2 km and another underground portion of 2.5 km.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-construction-majors-bid-for-zojila-tunnel-project-winner-to-provide-helicopter-service-to-site/articleshow/77320466.cms

Even the two unmanned missions scheduled before the manned mission in which Isro will send ‘humanoids’ (robots resembling humans) to space are unlikely to be completed by 2021-end.Talking to TOI, Isro chairman K Sivan said, “Because of the pandemic-triggered lockdown earlier and restrictions in different cities (where Isro centres are located), lot of our mission activities suffered. We will target (to launch two unmanned missions by next year). But a lot of work is still pending. We need to make an assessment first.”When asked whether Isro will be able to launch the final mission by August 15, 2022, the deadline fixed by PM Narendra Modi in his I-Day speech in 2018 so that it coincides with India’s 75th Independence Day, the Isro chief said, “It’s too early to say that. Will make every effort to go fast.” With Isro not even sure of completing two unmanned missions next year, the final manned mission launch won’t be possible by December 2021 or even early 2022.Sivan, however, said that “realisation of the service module and the crew module is going on. Indigenous development of environmental control and life support system is also on.” He also said that training of four astronauts in Russia “will be completed by either March or April next year and they will thereafter be undergoing further training in India”.Last month, Isro said its heavy-lifter GSLV MkIII launcher was identified for the Gaganyaan mission and the process for human rating (compatible for carrying humans) of the rocket was in progress. In order to human rate the booster, many new design features have been introduced in the hardware.A week ago, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) had on November 30 delivered the biggest cryogenic propellant tank (C32 LH2) ever fabricated by the company to Isro much ahead of its schedule. The tank is a developmental cryogenic propellant tank of aluminium alloy designed for improving the payload capability of the GSLV MK-III that will carry astronauts to space. HAL also supported the space agency in the developmental phase of the crew atmospheric re-entry experiment and PAD abort test for crew escape.Likewise, engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L&T) last month delivered the first hardware — a booster segment — for the Gaganyaan launcher. “Notwithstanding the limitations imposed by Covid-19, the middle segment of the world’s third-largest solid propellant rocket booster ‘S-200’ has been delivered ahead of schedule with zero-defects,” the company said. Sivan had then complimented L&T, saying “both L&T and Isro teams have relentlessly worked on realising the flight hardware ahead of schedule while maintaining the highest quality standards required for a human space flight mission”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gaganyaan-launch-delayed-as-pandemic-stalls-isro-work/articleshow/79610168.cms

In fact, BMRCL had changed the corridor’s colour from red to pink.“Tunnel Boring Machine Urja will tunnel from Cantonment (Bamboo Bazar) towards Shivajinagar. Testing has been completed. Three more TBMs will be deployed along the section in a phased manner,” said a BMRCL source.Four giant TBMs, including Avni (earth), Urja (energy), Lavi (lion) and Vindhya (knowledge), will drill and cut through CBD areas between Vellara Junction and Pottery Town (5.5km). In February 2019, Larsen & Toubro received bids for the underground section from Vellara Junction to Shivajinagar (2.7km) and Shivajinagar to Pottery Town (2.8km).L&T had procured four TBMs from China Railway Construction Heavy Industry Corporation Limited (CRCHI). Tunnel shafts, which will be used to lower the machines, were created at Shivajinagar and Cantonment stations.“The tunnelling process is finally kicking off after several obstacles. First, it was land acquisition and then delay in the arrival of TBMs from China because of Covid-19. This was followed by visa restrictions for Chinese engineers to assemble these machines and shortage of workers due to lockdown. In fact, tunnelling was supposed to start in March 2020 but was delayed due to the pandemic,” said a senior BMRCL official.The TBMs are expected to tunnel 2.5-5 metres per day, depending on the geographical condition they encounter.BMRCL has set 2024 as the deadline for commissioning of the underground section. It took about five years to complete the 10km tunnelling work during Phase I.ITD Cementation India Ltd is responsible for construction of the 4.6km underground section between Tannery Road and Nagawara.

It said the decision was not linked to tension on the border with China. Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority decided to float fresh tenders under Make in India initiative. In March 2018, China’s CRRC Corporation Ltd and BYD had submit bids to supply train sets. In January, MMRDA decided to float fresh bids as a bidder was unresponsive. MMRDA said, “For the present bid, responses were received from two companies, both Chinese. They were continuously seeking revision in terms and conditions, and eligibility criteria, even after uploading of documents.” Metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said MMRDA did not want a Scomi-like situation, when it had to depend on foreign manufacturers even for spare parts of monorail coaches. “As the companies are dictating changes in tender conditions, MMRDA decided to search for technology partners in India and develop them in India. As we do not require large quantities, Indian companies can manufacture and supply them in less time,” he said. MMRDA had appointed Larsen & Toubro and Scomi Engineering (LTSE) consortium as contractors for monorail project in 2008. On December 14, 2018, MMRDA terminated the contractor LTSE “for failure to perform and fulfil contractual obligations”.Malaysian firm Scomi Engineering had failed to supply adequate rakes, hampering the project. In the current economic situation, due to Covid-19 and in line with Government of India polices to encourage Make in India schemes, it was decided to look for an Indian technology partner for development and long-term support. An MMRDA spokesperson said, “Considering this, we decided to cancel the tender and restart the process immediately, with revised eligibility criteria, such as manufacturing facilities should have been in India for 10 years on similar projects to enable participation of Indian companies.” MMRDA also decided to initiate dialogue with Indian manufactures like BHEL and BEML. It had floated bids on June 16, with the cost of each rake estimated at Rs 40 crore. MMRDA operates monorail services with five rakes at a 20-minute frequency between Chembur-Jacob Circle. Services were suspended since lockdown was announced on March 25. ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bidding-by-two-chinese-firms-for-10-mono-rakes-shot-down/articleshow/76474039.cms

GSIDC may not be able to complete the High Court Complex at Porvorim by December 2020 if it is unable to release funds to the contractors in time.Paucity of funds has brought all infrastructure projects to a standstill. While chief minister Pramod Sawant, who is also the chairman of GSIDC, had asked the corporation to fast track certain projects, the lack of funds has proved to be a stumbling block.“The state government has to stand guarantee before the banks. The modalities will have to be finalized and only then can the works resume,” said an official.On August 31, TOI reported that the state government has decided to adopt the ‘discounting bill’ method to clear around Rs 700 crore worth of contractors’ bill. The adoption of the bill discounting option means that banks, contractors and the government through various departments will have to register themselves on the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) trade receivables electronic discount System (TReDS) platform for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) - an online electronic institutional mechanism aimed at facilitating the financing of trade receivables through multiple financiers. Big contractors who have taken up major works including construction of bridges and roads are expected to benefit from the scheme.When the GSIDC board met on July 23, it cleared a proposal to give the state legislative assembly complex a Rs 7 crore facelift. Sawant, who chaired the meeting, also asked GSIDC to ensure that the new High Court complex at Porvorim is also ready by December. According to officials, the finance department has yet to accord financial approval for the Rs7crore facelift for the Assembly complex. “The priority was to complete those projects which are already 80% to 90% complete. Putting more money to complete projects is better than pouring money into new projects,” said an official.Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has stopped work on the Atal Setu bridge’s Panaji arm and work on the second phase of the Neugi Nagar bridge has also come to a standstill.M Venkat Rao (MVR), the contractor for the High Court of Bombay complex at Porvorim has also reduced the pace of work to a bare minimum to keep the workers engaged.

Irdai said TCS, Larsen and Toubro InfoTech, Wipro and EIT Service India Private Ltd (a DXC Technology company) have been shortlisted for the next round of bidding.  The four companies had submitted their initial bids in response to an 'expression of interest' floated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) in August.  L&T InfoTech has been providing BAP services on a BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer) model to Irdai since 2011. The contract is expiring this month.  Irdai said BAP was implemented for automation of registration and other connected activities for insurers, brokers, surveyors and third party administrators, as well as automation of product approvals, branch office opening and advertisements, among others.  In addition to providing the BAP services, the selected company will also be responsible for enhancing the services/functionality of the platform.  While inviting the expression of interest, Irdai had said 'BAP 2.0' will be the next version of the project with additional business and administrative processes designed to provide a significantly enhanced experience to end-users through a major revamp of some of the current interfaces.  The regulator said the BAP system has been designed for effective supervision and regulation including compliance, monitoring trends of the insurance industry, risk based assessment of functioning of insurers, providing early warning signal and initiating corrective action.  As part of BAP, Irdai had introduced the concept of e-filing, doing away with manual filing and paper based records in its departments.

The letter adds that the leakage can lead to tunnel bursting, endangering the lives of several people.In his communication to the Centre and the state government, activist Bharat Jhunjhunwala, who also submitted photos and videos taken by a local whistleblower as proof of his allegations, urged for an inspection of the tunnel and asked the authorities to ‘take a decision whether it would be safe to allow commissioning of the project in these circumstances’. Notably, private engineering and construction firm Larsen & Toubro (L&T) had announced 100% completion and readiness for commissioning of the 99 MW hydroelectric project in September this year. The company’s authorities, when queried, denied any such leakage, adding that “these allegations hold ulterior motives”. In a written communication to TOI via email, a company spokesperson said, “The allegations are baseless and motivated with vested interest. As the matter is sub-judice, we will not comment further on the specifics of the issue.”Meanwhile, in his letter, sent out on October 27, Jhunjhunwala said that the leakage in the HRT may lead to a disaster when the process of electricity generation would kickstart. The letter, accessed by TOI, reads, “The leakage may entail the water moving at a high speed in the tunnel. This is likely to scour the damaged area of the HRT, thereby leading to tunnel bursting and endangering the lives of people living below Adit-3.” The activist added that “Rudraprayag has already suffered a massive tragedy in Kedarnath in 2013 and this district might face another disaster if officials fail to address such sensitive issues relating to the hydroelectric power plant.” “Leakage from a stable tunnel is already happening. During electricity generation, things may go absolutely turbulent and there will be a high possibility of tunnel bursting. Such a disaster will be a major loss not just for the state but also for the entire country,” said Jhunjhunwala.Notably, Jhunjhunwala had earlier filed a PIL in the HC alleging that the construction of the Singoli-Bhatwari hydroelectric power plant went on despite the expiry of the environmental clearance issued for the project by MoEFCC. While hearing the petition on October 12, the HC had given four weeks’ time to the Centre, state government, and L&T to file their counter affidavits in the case. Reacting to the allegations of work continuing at the site despite lapse of environmental clearance, L & T officials had told TOI that all the construction work at the site was completed before August 23 (the date till when environmental clearance was obtained). “We had intimated the completion of work to the government of Uttarakhand via a letter dated June 27, 2020. We also informed the MoEFCC via letter dated August 19, 2020, about the completion of all works including environmental obligations and requested them to inspect the site,” a company spokesperson had said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/singoli-bhatwari-hydroelectric-project-facing-leakage-in-tunnel-may-lead-to-disaster-alleges-activist-firm-executing-project-terms-allegations-baseless/articleshow/79103799.cms

This is a special campaign under which door-to-door contact will happen to collect donations through sale of coupons. Contributions for the temple other than the special drive have already begun and will continue, said Giri.So far Rs100 crore have been collected for the project. The Rs6 crore collected during the drive of 1990s has also been handed over to the trust, he said.Giri said the idea is to make Ayodhya the cultural capital of the world. The campus will have a number of facilities like a yagnashala, library and a martyrs’ memorial. “The memorial will pay homage to all those who have laid down their lives for the temple, which include those who fought the war during the invasion of 1528AD and also the karsevaks who lost their lives.”Giri said the design of temple’s foundation will be decided on Tuesday after a meeting with experts from IITs at Mumbai, Hyderabad, Surat and Roorkee. “They have come up with two suggestions for the foundation. After finalizing the plan in the meeting, we hope to start construction by January. It will take over three years to complete the temple structure,” he said.The earlier plan had been put up by Larsen & Toubro on the request of then president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad late Ashok Singhal. Now, alternatives are being explored, he said.During the donation drive coupons worth Rs1,000, Rs100 and even Rs10 will be sold. The idea is to get contribution from even the poorest for which coupons worth Rs10 will be sold.The donation drive has drawn flak from other parties, who call it be an election campaign of the BJP. Reacting to this, Giri said, “We have nothing to do with any party, yet if the drive helps the country in any way, then let it.”Donations will be sought from devotees of Lord Rama even in neighbouring countries like Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, and also Pakistan and Afghanistan.“The idea is to bring students from these countries to India. If the devotees of Lord Rama in such places feel isolated then we are here to assure them that India is always there for them. This way it will help build bridges too,” said Giri.BOX‘No hosp at temple site’On a question whether the trust will also build a hospital at the temple land, like the Sunni Wakf Board is doing on the 5 acre plot granted to it, Govindneya Giri said, “It’s not our job.

He heard a sound like blast and the earth literally shook.As the dust billowed on the road, Sheikh and his customers ran towards the building of Larsen & Toubro (L&T). Some more people ran towards the site, but on reaching there neither Sheikh nor the others could make a sense as the mammoth building they saw daily had turned into rubble.However, Parth Purohit, who is into construction business, stopped his car and rushed to help those who were trapped. Purohit was passing by the building after dropping a relative at Chhani octroi post when he felt the tremors. “It felt like an earthquake initially and when I saw to my right, I saw building falling like a pack of cards,” said Purohit who lives in Harni. Purohit added that as the dust settled, he rushed to help the labourers who were on the front side and had suffered minor injuries.A security guard of the vacant building Khoda Chauhan too feared for his life when he heard the blast. Chauhan was in the security cabin on the rear side of the building and when he felt the rear portion may also collapse, he jumped a six-foot high wall and ran to a safer distance. “There was a doctor and two other persons with me in the cabin and we all jumped because we could not realize for a while what had happened,” said Chauhan, a resident of Koyali.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/the-noise-was-nothing-less-than-an-earthquake/articleshow/71668734.cms

The unavailability of workers trained to carry out engineering jobs has hit the progress of several key infrastructure projects in the city, like the Dwarka Expressway and the Sohna Elevated Road.78358759Officials agreed that most of the workers who were returning from their homes were unskilled or semi-skilled and could not be involved in big-ticket projects. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and private contractors agreed that the workforce strength was limping back to pre-lockdown figures, but added there was still a scarcity of trained labourers. This, they said, had posed challenges in ensuring the quality of work and the progress of the projects.“The shortage of skilled workers is certainly creating impediments. Although the situation is gradually improving and workers are coming back in batches, it will take some time to achieve the pre-lockdown productivity levels,” said a senior NHAI official.At the Dwarka Expressway project, where advanced technology is being deployed to build the corridor, officials are finding it difficult to strike a balance between productivity and quality of work. The project officials claimed that though they had achieved 60-70% of the workforce, the share of skilled labourers was critically low.“First, our workforce got reduced to 25-30% during the lockdown period. The workers who had left didn’t return to the city until late in July and August. Now, workers are there in the market, but most are not fit for skilled jobs. Many even lie to us about their experience just to get the job and because there aren’t enough skilled labourers available, we are forced to keep them and impart training,” said a senior project official looking after packages 3 and 4 of the Dwarka Expressway.To bridge the gap between existing resources and what is required to carry out the project work, contractors are being asked to provide training to the available workers in a private institute in New Delhi before employing them. But even after getting the required training, it takes several weeks for the supervisors to help the workers adapt to the machinery, tools, project designs and quality standards.“We have our training institutes in New Delhi. Workers are sent there for a month-long training and only then, they are allowed at the site. But, when 40-50% of the workers who’ve come back are unskilled or semi-skilled, it takes more than just training. At the worksite, regular monitoring and guidance of supervisors are required. To put it into a nutshell, our resources are squeezed beyond a point to grapple with a shortage of labourers. But, we can’t help evade its consequences—reduced productivity and delay in work,” said a senior official at Larsen & Toubro.the contractor for the project.At other infrastructure projects too, the acute shortage of skilled labourers has posed a challenge in keeping the required momentum for the work and meeting the SOPs and quality standards of the government.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/big-infra-projects-in-gurgaon-hit-hard-by-absence-of-skilled-workforce/articleshow/78354896.cms

Birla","MUMBAI: Two of India’s largest conglomerates — Tata and Aditya Birla — have decided to evaluate applying for a banking licence, if RBI guidelines favour them. On Friday, an RBI committee recommended offering such licences to industrial houses by making necessary amendments in banking laws. It has also recommended allowing NBFCs, owned by industrial houses, with an asset size of over Rs 50,000 crore, to be converted into banks.  79331805Tata’s NBFC arm, Tata Capital, has an asset size of over Rs 74,500 crore, while Aditya Birla’s NBFC unit Aditya Birla Capital, has an asset size of over Rs 59,000 crore. While it will be some time before the final RBI guidelines are rolled out, the two conglomerates have always had banking aspirations. In 2013, the two companies had submitted applications for banking licences when the RBI issued new guidelines for opportunities in the private sector. But Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, withdrew its application after it found out that RBI’s conditions were restrictive and adhering to them would impact its other businesses. Aditya Birla Group, on the other hand, did not get a licence as the RBI refused to grant permissions to industrial houses. Only IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank had managed to acquire licences. The RBI had said then that all eligible applicants may not be allowed to promote banks.  79333701Several other industrial houses, like Bajaj and Larsen & Toubro, who had shown interest to acquire banking licences in 2013, are expected to evaluate options this time too. These conglomerates have NBFCs that are larger than many mid-sized banks in India.“We welcome the report of the RBI’s internal working group on the ownership guidelines and corporate structure for Indian private sector banks. NBFCs with a proven track record, supported by the brand values of reputed corporates, can play a key role in bringing the benefits of banking and economy to the underserved and newer segments of India,” said an Aditya Birla Group spokesperson.For Tata and Birla, it will be a second coming if they win banking licences. In 1917, Tata established the Tata Industrial Bank but the latter ran into trouble and had to be amalgamated with Central Bank of India in 1923. It was the first merger in India’s banking history. Birlas, meanwhile, established United Commercial Bank (UCO) in 1943, which was nationalised in 1969. G D Birla, Kumar Mangalam Birla’s great grandfather, stayed the chairman of UCO for long before handing over the charge to M P Birla, during whose term the bank was taken over by the Indira Gandhi government.In 2013, Tata Sons had said that RBI rules were coming in the way of its international operations, which account for two-thirds of its multi-billion-dollar revenue. The rule it found restrictive was the RBI’s requirement for conglomerates to transfer their financial services business to a non-operative financial holding company. But Aditya Birla, in an attempt to procure the licence, had agreed to abide by the rule and proposed to transfer its financial services business to a non-operative financial holding company. In fact, group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had stepped down from the board of the RBI in 2013 to avoid conflict of interest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tatas-aditya-birla-look-to-reopen-banking-account/articleshow/79332020.cms

The deal, if closed, will be the latest bet by KKR in the country’s manufacturing and industrial sector after its investment in JBF Industries last year. L&T Valves, a more than five decade-old-company, clocked revenues of Rs 1,465 crore and profits of Rs 138 crore in fiscal 2016. The unit manufactures industrial valves for key sectors like oil & gas, power and chemicals, among others.Other investors, including London-based private equity fund Actis, have fielded interest in L&T Valves, which has three manufacturing facilities in the country. But KKR is said to be more aggressive. KKR has been working on the deal for the past six months and has had several meetings with the Larsen & Toubro leadership, which is actively working on divesting non-core businesses like valves and hydrocarbons.The conglomerate’s chairman A M Naik will decide on the eventual investor and the quantum of stake it would sell in the valves unit, a decision which is expected within a few weeks, sources said. Last year, media reports said Larsen & Toubro was seeking a $700-million valuation for an outright sale of the asset.The eventual plan of the $16-billion Larsen & Toubro is to exit the industrial valves business completely and the move to sell part of its 100% stake is towards that direction. The diversified enterprise’s stated intention is to get out of small, non-core businesses which have revenues of Rs 1,000-1,500 crore. L&T Valves accounted for just 1.18% of the construction and engineering company’s net assets and 2.7% of its profits. The conglomerate, over the last few years, has been divesting several non-core units such as petrol pump vending machines and plastic moulding machines businesses to rationalise its wide portfolio.Naik confirmed that the company is in talks with investors to sell a stake in the valves business but said that no deal has been sealed yet. KKR India head Sanjay Nayar declined to comment on the story. KKR, which set up its India operations nine years ago, has invested more than $2 billion in various companies till date. L&T Valves started as a joint venture between Larsen & Toubro and UK’s Serck Audco in 1961. Later, following the acquisition of Serck Audco by Flowserve, the latter continued as a partner in the India valves business. However, in 2013, Larsen & Toubro bought out its foreign ally’s stake, thus gaining 100% control of the valves business, which is a leading player in the segment.

If approved as proposed, companies will be able to issue shares with either superior or fractional voting rights. This comes at a time when founder-control over strategic decisions in a company against growing investor influence is one of the on-going debates, especially in tech-startups. This is because the founders dilute their stakes, while raising capital from investors. This also comes at a time when Larsen & Toubro has made a hostile bid for software company Mindtree, where founders hold 13% stake. Most recently, cab-hailing major Lyft’s IPO documents show how founders of the company control majority of decision-making rights due to dual-class voting structure. They have 20 votes for every one vote of an investor in the company. This could also help companies fight better in case of a hostile takeover attempt by other investors or companies.

A bench of Acting Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice Girish Kulkarni, said Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation andnthe contractor, Larsen & Toubro, shall abide by recommendations of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. In August 11, 2017, the HC had restrained MMRC from carrying out construction and ancillary activities from 10 pm to 6 am on a petition by local resident advocate Robin Jaisinghani who complained about the noise. MMRC recently sought modification of this order to carry a round-the-clock tunnel boring work. At the HC’s instance, NEERI monitor the ambient noise levels and confirmed that noise from ongoing construction exceeds prescribed levels of 55 decibel during day and 45 decibel night time. Ambient noise level for overall sampling locations during the day ranged from 68.5 to 91.9 decibel and 60.3 to 83.4 decibel at night. It recommended use of noise barriers and fitting mufflers to all equipment used in above ground work. The court allowing the Metro work to be carried out at night has directed that State government shall immediately and within a week make available a grievance redressal mechanism so that those affected by the noise can approach it.On August 20 while reserving the verdict, the bench said the project is in larger public interest and the contractor will have to take precautions. Senior advocate S U Kamdar, representing contractor Larsen & Toubro, had submitted that it is open to taking noise mitigation measures. He said the tunnel boring work will be carried out 25 feet below the ground and it will not be heard. ``Once it starts, it cannot stop,’’ he said. Jaisinghani said his objection is to noise from movement of trucks following loading of muck and lowering of precast tunnel lining which can be done during the day. But Kamdar said it will majorly lead to traffic congestion in the area. Kamdar also said the contractor will not exceed 10 decibel of the ambient noise levels.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, for MMRC, a grievance redressal mechanism will be set up comprising a person on site 24 × 7 with toll free telephone line and also an email address to receive complaints.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-lifts-night-ban-on-metro-work-at-cuffe-parade/articleshow/65527243.cms

Sources said about 100 workers are present at the site usually, but most had gone home for the festival. It was around 7.40am that the concrete slab came crashing down between pillars 107 and 109 near Daultabad.81743933The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said it had suspended two officials — one each of the contractor and the consultant — in connection with the collapse. The accident comes a little more than a month after a girder being lifted with chains came off the hook and crashed on to the ground at another construction site of the same expressway project on Pataudi Road. A video of the February 12 collapse had come to the fore two weeks ago.On Sunday morning, senior officers of the police, state disaster response force and civil defence teams rushed to the accident site and cordoned off a portion of the area. A team of the National Disaster Response Force also reached the spot and looked for any worker who might have been trapped under the debris. No casualties were reported. Sources said technical flaws at the site had come to the fore a few days ago. Last week, two girders had been placed between pillars 107 and 109. During examination, officials were learnt to have found a crack on one of the girders. “We decided to change the girder and work had started on it last Thursday. On Saturday night, an engineer found some mechanical issue and ordered the work to be stopped. Work had been suspended in the morning too when the girder collapsed,” a source said.NHAI said it would constitute a technical committee to ascertain what could have caused the collapse. Preliminary reports, sources said, suggested that pillar number 108 was damaged and could not withstand the weight.“The cause of the accident would be investigated. Prima facie, it seems to be the result of a technical fault. A technical committee will probe the accident and samples will be sent to the Central Road Research Institute to check the quality of materials being used,” said Nirman Jambulkar, the NHAI project director.Officials of Larsen & Toubro, which has been handed the project, ruled out any lapses on the company’s part. “Engineers of the company are trying to determine the cause of the collapse. Mechanical issues such as these can occur while carrying out such heavy construction work. That’s why we ensure safety measures are well in place. We’ll submit the details of the accident to NHAI soon,” said an L&T official.Work on the Dwarka Expressway project has picked up pace over the past few weeks. During a recent inspection, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari had announced that the entire expressway, stuck for long, would be completed by August next year.Residents of highrises that form the backdrop of the expressway project were jolted out of sleep by the deafening sound of the girder crashing down. Some even mistook it for an earthquake. As people stepped out of their homes, they saw a thick cloud of smoke had engulfed the area. “I, for certain, felt tremors. I rushed out and saw that a portion of the flyover had collapsed,” said Devi Ram, a resident of Rajendra Park.Rajesh Mandal, who had gone out for his morning walk, said the workers who came down with the girder were not wearing safety cables. “Otherwise, they would be hanging in the air. I found two workers had suffered injuries to their hand, while a third one was nursing a wound in the leg.

The prime minister spoke of the space sector's significance in communication and navigation and told the participants that they will be co-passengers with ISRO in this age of space research, expressing hope that the country would soon become the manufacturing hub of space assets.""He said the decision to unlock India's potential in the space sector has heralded a new age of public-private partnership in this sector,"" the PMO said, quoting Modi.Taking note of the plans of companies to make rockets and satellites, he said this marks a big change that will further strengthen India's foray into the space sector. He said private investment in the sector will lead to the creation of hi-tech jobs, which will provide a host of opportunities to the talent pool in IITs and NITs and other technical institutions. The prime minister said it is his firm belief that just like Indian talent has been able to attain worldwide fame in the IT sector, it will be able to do so in the space arena as well.Underlining that the space sector reforms are not limited to ensuring ease of doing business, he said necessary mechanisms have also been put in place to ensure help for the participants at each stage, including making available testing facilities and launchpads. He said the endeavour is not only to ensure that India becomes a competitive space market, but also to ensure that the benefits of the space programme reach out to the poorest. He asked the participants to think boldly and work for the benefit of the society and the country, the statement added. The Union Cabinet had in June 2020 decided to open up the space sector to enable the participation of Indian private sector in the entire gamut of space activities. With the creation of Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe), the reforms will provide a level playing field for private companies and start-ups, the PMO said. Subsequently, several ventures have submitted proposals with IN-SPACe under the Department of Space, and they pertain to a vast range of activities, including satellite constellation, small satellite launch vehicles, ground station, geospatial services, propulsion systems and application products, it said. During the interaction, K Sivan, secretary, Department of Space and ISRO Chairman, briefed the prime minister on various proposals received from industry and noted that more than 25 industries have already approached the department for undertaking their space activities. Sunil Bharti Mittal from Bharti Enterprises, Jayant Patil from Larsen & Toubro, Srinath Ravichandran from Agnikul Cosmos, Pawan Kumar Chandana from Skyroot Aerospace, H S Shankar from Alpha Design Technologies, Rakesh Verma from MapmyIndia, Awais Ahmed from PIXXEL India and Srimathy Kesan from Space Kidz India also expressed their views during the session, the PMO said.

But defence experts said they didn’t address critical issues such as the certification of systems and locally-made components, and won’t prevent the military from making emergency purchases of equipment from foreign vendors.Modi has struggled to transform the world’s second biggest arms importer into a defense manufacturing powerhouse since a 2014 proposal to produce indigenous equipment and systems worth $100 billion by 2020. The target has since been slashed in half and the deadline extended to 2027, while the need for more advanced weaponry grows more urgent following the most deadly border clash with China in four decades.The ministry’s ban on imports will have little impact beyond “measures already taken to localize defense production and reduce import dependency,” said Amit Cowshish, a consultant with the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute For Defence Studies and Analyses and a former financial adviser on acquisitions in the ministry of defence.“The promotion of local manufacturing requires more cooperation between the military and domestic defence industry,” Cowshish said. “Mutual trust is missing, with everyone working at cross purposes.”While New Delhi is the world’s third-biggest military spender, its air force, navy and the army are still equipped with weapons that are largely obsolete.‘Self-Reliance Push’The push for locally-produced systems and hardware was a big step toward self-reliance in defence and creates an opportunity for the defence industry to manufacture the items using their own design and development capabilities, the ministry of defence said in a statement on August 9.A defense ministry spokesperson was not immediately available for a comment.Similar policy declarations to stem imports were made by India in 2013, under then prime minister Manmohan Singh, and also by Modi’s administration in his first term in 2018, didn’t significantly increase the ‘Made in India’ products deployed by the military.“Time and access to technology is fundamental to such efforts -- currently a large proportion India’s defense industry is little better than system integrators,” said Rahul Bedi, a New Delhi-based independent defense analyst. “A major dose of realism is needed.”The banned list is also vague on the position of joint-ventures between Indian and foreign manufacturers and license produced weapon systems, he said.Despite its drawbacks, nascent defence industry is cautiously optimistic about the new policy.“We are sure that this list will keep getting amended to add newer programs that lay a road map matching our nation’s aspiration,” said Jayant Patil, senior executive vice president (defence & smart technologies), Larsen & Toubro Limited.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-ban-on-47-billion-arms-imports-sowing-uncertainty-experts/articleshow/77596370.cms

The residents form part of a group called ‘Save our coast’.The HC bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice S S Shinde wasn’t keen to proceed with the matter after project contractor Larsen & Toubro Ltd, which had intervened, submitted through its counsel Mukul Rohatgi, that a challenge to the work was already filed and pending before the Supreme Court after the apex court had last December permitted the contractor and BMC to “reclaim the land, build and secure the road.’’.The bench asked the residents’ counsel Janak Dwarkadas whether they would “like to put in a security (deposit) as a condition precedent) to hear their claims on merits.’’ The residents sought liberty to approach the SC and raise all its issues there now, which the HC gave.The HC thus said, “The PIL petition is not entertained. It stands dismissed.’’The HC passed no opinion on merits of the matter.The residents wanted to enforce the prohibitory orders passed under the Disaster Management Act, first in March and latest one in May.On May 22, the HC had given BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) counsel Anil Sakhare time to file its reply after residents’ counsel Janak Dwarkadas said relaxations permitted by the state on May 19 permits in-situ construction, only if workers are available on site, while here the BMC was bringing in skilled workers from outside. The PIL said more than 500 workers working in close proximityWhile pre-monsoon related work was permitted by the state, their plea was that tunneling, blasting and widening of road by reclamation of land was on, which cannot be classified as pre-monsoon works.The disaster management secretary said the PIL was “misconceived’’ and deserved to be “dismissed.’’ In his reply, the secretary said, “All urgent pre-monsoon works were exempted from restrictions.’’L&T had intervened to say it was as the project contractor “best placed to answer all the allegations and provide necessary details’’ and any orders would directly affect it.The BMC and L&T submitted that the work being done was in compliance with all permissions and that the petitioners”failed to appreciate the extent of pre-monsoon work'' required in the project.Besides the PIL now is “infructuous’’ said the authorities with the latest orders of the state and Centre.Hemant Kumar, Group General Counsel of L&T later, said “If they go to the SC, we are prepared fo contest their claims there too.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bombay-hc-dismisses-pil-against-coastal-road-work-gives-residents-liberty-to-raise-issue-before-sc/articleshow/76287202.cms
