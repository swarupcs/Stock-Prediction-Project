The global financial major on Friday downgraded SBI, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank, retained its 'buy' rating on HDFC Bank while it upgraded Bajaj Finance to 'neutral' rating from 'sell'.""We believe the proverbial Goldilocks period - strong growth and strong/visible profitability - is over for the financial sector in the near-term as headwinds are increasing,"" the report by Goldman Sachs noted.107953061The headwinds include rising pressure on cost of funds due to structural challenges in the funding environment. Another negative for the banking and financial sector could be the growing concerns on rising consumer leverage posing potential asset quality challenges, particularly in the unsecured lending space, leading to higher credit costs. It also listed pressure on operating costs for banks and financials due to elevated wage inflation as well as the need to expand the distribution network for future deposit growth as a headwind.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they preferred lenders that are strong in the commercial retail space, compared to the ones that have strong presence in the consumer retail space. They believe entities with strong presence in the commercial retail space are expected to grow faster and offer a much better returns profile.Goldman Sachs expects up to 37% downside in Yes Bank's stock price, between 3% and 4% in SBI and ICICI Bank but sees up to 33% upside in HDFC Bank.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/headwinds-emerging-for-banks-says-goldman/articleshow/107953046.cms

Read more about the court's findings and the alleged corruption case.,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court held that a December 12, 2022 arrest Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of former ICICI Bank Managing Director Chanda Kochhar and her businessman husband, Deepak Kochhar was sans application of mind and regard to law and amounts to “abuse of power’’. The findings come in a reasoned order now available of the HC's Feb 6 pronouncement of their arrest being illegal.The CBI arrested the couple in an alleged corruption case over a high value Rs 3200 crore loan given between 2009-2012 to the VN Dhoot promoted Videocon group with Chanda Kochhar as a sanctioning committee member. The January 2019 FIR alleged that in a quid pro quo, Dhoot had invested Rs 64 crore in Deepak Kochhar’s company via a circuitous route.Justices Anuja Prabhudessai and N R Borkar held the arrests “illegal for breach of mandatory provision under section 41 A of Criminal procedure code’’ . The section mandates notice be issued first when offence attracts max seven years’ imprisonment and only non-cooperation can merit arrest.Senior counsel Amit Desai for the Kochhars, citing their constitutional right to silence, argued their arrest was illegal as they had already been interrogated by another central agency,ED, and cooperated.The HC held that while an Investigating Agency has a right to interrogate, the accused has a right to remain silent under Art 20 (3) of the Constitution, to protect against self incrimination. ""Exercise of the right to remain silent cannot be equated with non-cooperation,'' said the HC.CBI counsel Kuldeep Patil had argued that the Kochhars’ arrest was legal and necessary to confront them with co-accused Dhoot. The HC, however, observed that the CBI had knowledge at the time of registration of the FIR of the allegations that the petitioners are involved in the conspiracy, its gravity and alleged quid pro quo and yet felt no need to arrest and interrogate the petitioners for a period of over three years.The HC confirming a Jan 2023 order of interim bail granted to the Kochhars held that the CBI was unable to demonstrate the existence of circumstances on which it decided to arrest them. “Absence of such circumstances, information or material which is the sine qua non for the decision of arrest reduces the provision of a dead letter and renders the arrest illegal,’’ the HC held.In September 2020, the Enforcement Directorate had arrested Deepak Kochhar and attached his properties in proceedings initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on the basis of the CBI’s FIR. The HC granted bail to Deepak in March 2021, observing that there was no loss caused to the bank due to his actions, and in January 2022, the SC dismissed a special leave petition filed by the ED against the HC relief.Kochhar said she received summons from the CBI in July 2022. The petitioners were placed under arrest on 23.12.2022, when they had appeared before the Investigating Officer for interrogation pursuant to notice dated 15.12.2022 issued under Section 41A of the Cr.P.C; on the grounds of non-cooperation with the probe.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-high-court-quashes-cbi-arrest-of-chanda-kochhar-and-husband-as-abuse-of-power/articleshow/107830526.cms

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

ICICI Bank holds 75% stake in its securities arm, while public shareholders own the remaining 25%. I-Sec was listed in 2018.Despite resistance from a section of retail investors, the proposal garnered significant support from institutional shareholders - 72% of public shareholder votes favouring the proposal, surpassing the required two-thirds majority. The institutional investor's segment swung the voting, with 84% voting in favour. However, nearly 68% of retail investors who participated in the vote were against the proposal.Following the announcement of the voting results, shares of ICICI Bank rose 1% on Thursday to Rs 1,096 while the shares of its securities arm declined 2%. Under the proposed scheme of arrangement, ICICI Securities will be delisted, and shareholders will receive 67 shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 shares they hold in the securities arm.Four proxy advisory firms, which advise institutional investors, recommended voting in favour of the proposal. There was, however, dissent among some retail investors who voiced their opposition to the swap ratio on social media. Some raised concerns over canvassing for votes in favour of the proposal by ICICI Bank employees and agents of ICICI Securities.

The section mandates notice be issued first when offence attracts max seven years’ imprisonment and only non-cooperation can merit arrest.Senior counsel Amit Desai for the Kochhars, citing their constitutional right to silence, argued their arrest was illegal as they had already been interrogated by another central agency,ED, and cooperated.The HC held that while an Investigating Agency has a right to interrogate, the accused has a right to remain silent under Art 20 (3) of the Constitution, to protect against self incrimination. ""Exercise of the right to remain silent cannot be equated with non-cooperation,'' said the HC.CBI counsel Kuldeep Patil had argued that the Kochhars’ arrest was legal and necessary to confront them with co-accused Dhoot. The HC, however, observed that the CBI had knowledge at the time of registration of the FIR of the allegations that the petitioners are involved in the conspiracy, its gravity and alleged quid pro quo and yet felt no need to arrest and interrogate the petitioners for a period of over three years.The HC confirming a Jan 2023 order of interim bail granted to the Kochhars held that the CBI was unable to demonstrate the existence of circumstances on which it decided to arrest them. “Absence of such circumstances, information or material which is the sine qua non for the decision of arrest reduces the provision of a dead letter and renders the arrest illegal,’’ the HC held.In September 2020, the Enforcement Directorate had arrested Deepak Kochhar and attached his properties in proceedings initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on the basis of the CBI’s FIR. The HC granted bail to Deepak in March 2021, observing that there was no loss caused to the bank due to his actions, and in January 2022, the SC dismissed a special leave petition filed by the ED against the HC relief.Kochhar said she received summons from the CBI in July 2022. The petitioners were placed under arrest on 23.12.2022, when they had appeared before the Investigating Officer for interrogation pursuant to notice dated 15.12.2022 issued under Section 41A of the Cr.P.C; on the grounds of non-cooperation with the probe.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-high-court-quashes-cbi-arrest-of-chanda-kochhar-and-husband-as-abuse-of-power/articleshow/107830526.cms

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

The court confirmed their bail and criticized the CBI for the casual and mechanical manner of the arrest. Find out more about the case and the allegations against ICICI Bank and Videocon.,"MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court on Tuesday held as ""illegal"" the arrest of ICICI Bank's former managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar and her businessman-husband Deepak Kochhar by the central bureau of investigation (CBI) in an alleged loan fraud case. A division bench of Justices Anuja Prabhudessai and N R Borkar confirmed a January 2023 interim order passed by another bench granting the duo bail soon after their arrest in the case. The couple was arrested by the CBI on December 23, 2022, in connection with the Videocon-ICICI Bank loan case.They immediately moved the HC challenging their arrest and sought it to be declared as illegal. By way of an interim order, they also sought to be released on bail. On January 9, 2023, the HC, in its interim order, granted bail to the duo after coming down heavily on the CBI for making the arrest in a ""casual and mechanical"" manner and without application of mind. On Tuesday, the bench led by Justice Prabhudessai allowed the duo's petition, thus declaring their arrest as ""illegal"" and confirming the earlier interim order. Apart from the Kochhars, the CBI had also arrested Videocon group founder Venugopal Dhoot in the case. He, too, was granted bail by the HC in January 2023 in its interim order.The central agency has alleged that ICICI Bank had sanctioned credit facilities to the tune of Rs 3,250 crore to Videocon Group companies promoted by Dhoot in violation of the Banking Regulation Act, Reserve Bank of India guidelines and credit policy of the private sector lender. The CBI had named Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar as well as Dhoot along with Nupower Renewables (NRL), managed by Deepak Kochhar, Supreme Energy, Videocon International Electronics Ltd and Videocon Industries Ltd as accused in the FIR registered in 2019 under Indian Penal Code sections related to criminal conspiracy and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The central agency has alleged that ICICI Bank, when it was headed by Chanda Kochhar, sanctioned credit facilities to the tune of Rs 3,250 crore to these companies in violation of norms. It further alleged that as a part of quid pro quo (a favour granted in return for something), Dhoot made an investment of Rs 64 crore in Nupower Renewables through Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd (SEPL), and transferred SEPL to Pinnacle Energy Trust managed by Deepak Kochhar through a circuitous route between 2010 and 2012.

The Mumbai-based private lender's standalone net profit rose to 2.31 billion rupees ($27.8 million) in the three months ended December 31, it said on Saturday. That was up from 515.20 million rupees in the same period a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected a net profit of 3.43 billion rupees, according to LSEG data.

Its net interest income, the difference between the interest earned on loans and that paid to depositors, rose 2.33% to 20.17 billion rupees.  The net interest margin, a key indicator of a bank's profitability, fell to 2.4% from 2.50% a year earlier, and the 2.30% reported in the prior quarter.

Yes Bank's net advances grew 11.8% on year to 2.18 trillion rupees ($26.23 billion), led by retail loans, while deposits rose 13.2%. Its gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio was at 2% at the end of December, unchanged from the end of the previous quarter.

If not set aside, it would sound the “death knell’’ for fundamental rights of citizens under the right to life and liberty, said her petition.Counsel for CBI, Kuldeep Patil, sought time to file a reply to the petition.Kochhar, 62, represented by Rashmikant and Partners said the sanction issued by ICICI Bank ltd on May 15, 2023, was “without any application of mind and in breach of Bank’s statutory duties.’’ Her petition says she was recognised in many “prestigious power lists’’ including among the TIME Magazines’ ‘100 most influential People in the World in 2015 and was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Indian Government in 2011, as well as the recipient of the ‘Woodrow Wilson Award for Global Corporate Citizenship’ by the Wilson Centre at Washington DC, USA.She also challenged all actions taken pursuant to the sanction, including orders passed by the special CBI court in the CBI case against Videocon International Electronics Ltd and others.In December 2017, a preliminary enquiry was registered against her by the CBI. In January 2019 the CBI registered an FIR against her and her husband Deepak Kochhar for alleged offences of cheating, criminal conspiracy and under the PC Act.In September 2020, the ED arrested her husband and attached his properties in proceedings initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on the basis of the CBI's first information report (FIR) as the predicate offence. She was never arrested by the ED. The HC granted bail to her husband in March 2021 observing that there was no loss caused to the bank due to his actions and in January 2022 the Supreme Court dismissed the special leave petition filed by the ED against the HC relief to him.But in July last year, she said after almost three years she received summons from the CBI and when she appeared on December 23, 2022 as she said he was “preoccupied’’ with legal matters, she was arrested on the grounds that she was not cooperating with the probe.The Kochhars challenged the arrest as illegal and sought quashing of the FIR.

This was the biggest single-session slide in the sensex in almost 23 months, which left investors poorer by about Rs 4 lakh crore, BSE data showed.Sub-par quarterly results by HDFC Bank, the most valued lender in the country, led to an over 8% crash in its stock price on Wednesday. This in turn affected investor sentiment about all banking and financial stocks and was the main reason for the sensex’s four-digit points slide. 106938182A weak overnight closing on Wall Street, after traders realised that in the backdrop of rising inflation reading in the US, its central bank may not cut rates as aggressively as was thought earlier, also weighed on domestic investor sentiment that led to Wednesday’s selloff, analysts and traders said.According to Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities, hawkish comments by a top US Federal Reserve official triggered a spike in yields on US 10-year bonds and the dollar index, which spooked European and Asian markets, including India. The country’s market valuations are also expensive compared to global stock indices and investors would wait for more positive cues now to extend their equity exposure, he said.Foreign portfolio investors led the day’s selling. End-of-the-session data on BSE showed that FPIs were net sellers at Rs 10,578 crore — the biggest single-session net outflow by this investor group since July 31, 2023. In contrast, domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 4,006 crore.The day’s session left investors poorer by Rs 4 lakh crore, with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 377 lakh crore, official data showed. The day witnessed a savage selloff in banking & financial stocks since the pandemic months of early 2020. After HDFC Bank announced its results on Tuesday showing strong growth in net profit, investors were sceptical about the quality of the lender’s numbers, including a tax write-back that boosted its bottom line.After a weak opening, HDFC Bank stock continued to slide through the session and closed 8.5% lower. The stock alone contributed to more than 50% of the sensex’s fall for the day. The other top contributors to the index’s fall were ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Bank, BSE data showed.The selloff in banking and financial stocks pulled down BSE’s bankex by 4%.For the next few sessions, market players feel that global factors like the widening conflict in West Asia and worries about rate cuts in the US market may weigh on investor sentiment.

As of late 2023, several prominent banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and Punjab National Bank (PNB), have made adjustments to their FD interest rates. Here’s an insightful comparison of the FD rates offered by these banks, focusing on the highest rates available and the corresponding tenures.SBIAccording to ET, SBI has recently increased its FD interest rates on specific tenures, effective from December 27, 2023. Notable changes include a 50 basis points hike for deposits maturing between 7 days to 45 days, bringing the rate to 3.50%.

As evident from the comparison, each bank has its unique offerings. Individuals should carefully assess their preferences and requirements before making an informed decision on where to invest their money for optimal returns.How do banks decide FD rates?Banks determine Fixed Deposit (FD) rates based on the repo rate set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks. Banks align their FD interest rates with the current repo rate. Investors can monitor changes in repo rates to identify opportune times to invest in FD schemes, optimizing potential returns.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fixed-deposit-interest-rates-sbi-vs-icici-bank-vs-hdfc-bank-vs-axis-bank-vs-pnb-fd-rate-compared/articleshow/106629390.cms

ICICI,2024-01-03T08:10:00+05:30,Times Of India,GST dept goes on tax demand overdrive,"The GST department has gone on a tax demand overdrive, targeting companies like Hindustan Unilever, ICICI Bank, and more. Find out the details and implications of these tax demands.","New Delhi: From Hindustan Unilever to ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Eicher Motors, almost all the big names of India Inc and thousands, if not lakhs, of smaller GST taxpayers have received tax demand on the eve of new year as authorities sought to meet the five-year deadline to raise claims, literally burning the midnight oil.The notices range from mismatch of input tax credit, mismatch in turnover for various returns to demand for non-payment of tax on payments made to expats (in case of MNCs) for which demand has been raised from multinationals despite the confusion over their legality.For instance, HUL has been slapped with a demand of over Rs 400 crore. “HUL has been proactively compliant in discharging all its GST dues for seconded employees. The company believes it has strong merits to challenge the demand as per the order and will make an assessment to exercise its right to appeal or make submissions before relevant authorities against the order. The order has no material impact on financials as well as no impact on operations or other activities of the company,” a spokesperson said.Tax consultants said that several MNCs have received similar demand notices.There is no count on the number of notices as the Centre and state authorities have issued separate orders. According to exchange filings, one large company received five notices between December 30 and 31 from various officers, while another received three between December 29 and 31.The tax demand ranges from a small portion of an entity’s turnover, which will not cause any material impact, to the entire turnover, which is bound to trigger litigation. For instance, the demand on LIC is over Rs 800 crore, including penalty, while for Eicher Motors it is Rs 130 crore and around Rs 27 crore for ICICI Bank.“Since December 31, 2023 was the last date for issue of assessment orders for 2017-18 it has resulted in raining of orders on the eve of the new year. Blame lies equally on the doorstep of taxpayers who casually reply to notices without submitting proper evidence before GST authorities,” said tax advocate RS Sharma.Under the law, cases are “time-barred” and demand has to be raised within five years of filing of final returns. For 2017-18, the notices had to be issued by September 30 and demand orders had to be issued by December 31. Companies stare at the prospect of getting another set of notices towards the end of April, the extended deadline for financial year 2018-19.“When thousands of notices are issued within a span of few days under pressure of meeting the statutory timeline, details of facts and figures are often missed. Even if a small percentage of these notices culminate into tax demands, the appeal process would entail substantial cash flow issues, given the requirement of pre-deposit of 10% at first level itself. As we go ahead, the authorities should plan in advance so that such last-minute pressure situations are avoided.

""HUL has been proactively compliant in discharging all its GST dues for seconded employees. The company believes it has strong merits to challenge the demand as per the order and will make an assessment to exercise its right to appeal or make submissions before relevant authorities against the order. The order has no material impact on financials as well as no impact on operations or other activities of the company,"" a spokesperson said.106497650Tax consultants said that several MNCs have received similar demand notices.There is no count on the number of notices as the Centre and state authorities have issued separate orders. According to exchange filings, one large company received five notices between December 30 and 31 from various officers, while another received three between December 29 and 31.The tax demand ranges from a small portion of an entity's turnover, which will not cause any material impact, to the entire turnover, which is bound to trigger litigation. For instance, the demand on LIC is over Rs 800 crore, including penalty, while for Eicher Motors it is Rs 130 crore and around Rs 27 crore for ICICI Bank.""Since December 31, 2023 was the last date for issue of assessment orders for 2017-18 it has resulted in raining of orders on the eve of the new year. Blame lies equally on the doorstep of taxpayers who casually reply to notices without submitting proper evidence before GST authorities,"" said tax advocate RS Sharma.Under the law, cases are ""time-barred"" and demand has to be raised within five years of filing of final returns. For 2017-18, the notices had to be issued by September 30 and demand orders had to be issued by December 31. Companies stare at the prospect of getting another set of notices towards the end of April, the extended deadline for financial year 2018-19.""When thousands of notices are issued within a span of few days under pressure of meeting the statutory timeline, details of facts and figures are often missed. Even if a small percentage of these notices culminate into tax demands, the appeal process would entail substantial cash flow issues, given the requirement of pre-deposit of 10% at first level itself. As we go ahead, the authorities should plan in advance so that such last-minute pressure situations are avoided. Also, the GST Council should consider reducing the quantum of pre-deposit required in the appeal process,"" said Pratik Jain, partner, Price Waterhouse & Co.Tax experts said that the current situation is far from the ease of business that was promised.

ICICI,2023-12-29T18:06:00+05:30,Times Of India,Stock Guide: What are India’s biggest private banks doing to fund future credit growth?,India Business News: Credit growth has been outpacing deposit growth for a year and a half now. How do banks plan on adding fresh deposits to keep funding this credit grow,"This article has been been written by the InvestYadnya.in team.Indian banks are going through a challenging environment amid India’s growing economy and the Reserve Bank of India’s tightening monetary conditions. Amid the country’s high inflationary environment, the RBI has gone through a series of interest rate hikes to absorb the surplus liquidity in the overall banking system. Accordingly, the RBI has raised the repo rate by almost 250 bps since the February 2022 MPC meeting and currently interest rates are hovering at their peak at 6.50%. These higher interest rates led to a rise in the cost of borrowing for the banks. So, currently, all banks have the same pain point — how to attract fresh deposits to fund future credit growth? Banks’ deposit traction needs to pick up to sustain healthy loan growth ahead. Here, we will take a deep dive into how Big 4 private banks are making a way ahead and addressing this challenge of new deposit addition.Indian banking sector: Gap between credit growth and deposit growth widenedOver the last year and a half, Indian banks’ credit growth has been outpacing the deposit growth majorly triggered by the improved economic outlook and initiation of a fresh capex cycle through both government and private investments. This means that Indian banks’ loan books are growing at a higher rate than the growth of their deposit books. The banks are disbursing new loans at a faster rate than the rate of adding new deposits. medium106382942(Source: RBI Data)(Data comprises of the loan book growth and the deposit growth of All Scheduled Commercial Banks in India across – Public Sector Banks, Private Banks, Foreign Banks and Small Finance banks, etc)Banking sector credit growth was boosted by HDFC twin’s amalgamation to 19.9% YoY. The credit growth stood at 15% YoY excluding HDFC Ltd. Post HDFC twins merger, there is a growing gap between credit growth and deposit growth. This gap, which reached 6-7% at its peak, has led banks to focus on expanding their networks to increase their deposit mobilization i.e. new deposit addition.Deposit war is intensifying aheadThe RBI has been taking measures to reduce the money available in the financial system as a way to combat inflationary pressures. This tightening of liquidity can make it more challenging for banks to attract deposits and maintain a healthy credit-to-deposit ratio.Accordingly, the major banks are trying to attract more new deposits from customers to bridge the gap and maintain their operations. medium106382984(Source: investyadnya.in)How are the Big 4 private banks strategizing to achieve incremental deposit growth?HDFC Bank: HDFC Bank is focusing on deposit mobilization i.e. adding incremental deposits by the new customers. HDFC Bank has expanded its branch network by 39% in the last two years. The bank is looking at strengthening its liability franchise with the capacity to sustain growth over the next 8-10 years. The bank’s ambitious target is to open 1,500 branches every year over the next 4-5 years. The Bank added almost 1,446 branches over the last four quarters (as of September 2023).ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank is also going for the new branch addition, though the pace of branch expansion is slower than HDFC Bank. ICICI Bank has added 656 new branches over the last four quarters. On the technology front, ICICI Bank is much ahead of HDFC Bank for new customers as well as deposit acquisition. ICICI Bank has been strategizing the repricing of term deposits (by raising the interest rates on term deposits) to have a competitive edge in the industry and attract fresh deposits. The management said the move will be reflected in terms of the cost of deposits, which is expected to see further catch-up. Axis Bank: Axis Bank is getting more deposits from its wealthy clients in the Burgundy segment. (Burgundy segment is a premium banking experience offered by Axis Bank that is designed for the privileged few, bringing them integrated wealth management solutions, a bouquet of lifestyle privileges, etc). The bank is also chasing salary accounts to attract new deposits. Also, the recent acquisition of Citibank’s consumer business has offered a new growth lever for the banks towards deposit mobilization. Kotak Mahindra Bank: Kotak Bank is tapping its digital highway for new deposit accretion. The bank successfully launched a new product - ActivMoney, a Mobile Banking app in Q1 FY24 and strategically marketed it very well. ActivMoney – “Earn FD wala interest in Savings Account via Auto sweep facility”. Kotak Bank is also offering higher rates on term deposits. medium106383042(Source: Investor presentations of respective banks)In this way, different banks are adopting different strategies to boost their deposit mobilisation and to drive growth in retail deposits. The success of each bank’s strategy depends on factors like the bank’s customer base, competition, and the economic environment. Adapting to changing circumstances and regulatory requirements is a key challenge for banks in maintaining a healthy balance between credit growth and deposit growth while also serving the needs of their customers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-guide-what-are-indias-biggest-private-banks-doing-to-fund-future-credit-growth/articleshow/106382676.cms

The need for a higher capital buffer comes at a time when the central bank analysed how problems in one bank could affect others in its financial stability report. The report shows that if the most critical bank were to fail, it would now affect 3.6% of all banks’ tier-1 capital, up from 2.2% in March 2023.RBI has also revised the methodology for evaluating systemically important (too big to fail) banks and included the ‘total value of digital payments’ criterion. However, gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of all scheduled commercial banks is projected to improve to 3.1% by September 2024 from 3.2%. The report said that if the macroeconomic environment worsens to a medium or a severe stress scenario, the ratio may rise to 3.6% and 4.4%, respectively.Even if the GNPAs rise to the worst-case 4.4%, the banking system would be able to comply with minimum capital requirements, with the system-level CRAR (capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio) in September 2024 projected at 14.8%, 13.5% and 12.2%, respectively, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios. 106361910“The health of the Indian financial system is steadily improving on the back of multi-year high earnings, low-level of stressed assets, and strong capital and liquidity buffers with financial institutions... Now is the time to consolidate these gains and enable the economy to move to a higher growth trajectory with macroeconomic and financial stability,” said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in the report.For SBI, the additional common equity tier-1 capital requirement has been raised to 80 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) above the prescribed level for banks, as opposed to 60bps.Similarly, HDFC Bank’s additional capital requirement has been adjusted to 40bps from 20bps. Meanwhile, for ICICI Bank, identified as the third systemically important institution, the additional capital requirement remains at 20bps over the prescribed level.The heightened domestic systemically important banks (D-SIB) surcharge for SBI and HDFC Bank will be effective from April 1, 2025. The update is based on March 31, 2023 data, accounting for the increased systemic importance of HDFC Bank following the merger with erstwhile HDFC on July 1, 2023. The report has also cautioned over the growing interconnectedness between banks and NBFCs through the funding route, highlighting the potential increase in contagion risk for banks due to idiosyncratic risks posed by various types of NBFCs.“Stress in the NBFC sector has been assessed to be higher under a high-risk stress scenario relative to the March 2023 position. Contagion risks may warrant monitoring on account of increased inter-bank exposure,” the report said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/too-big-to-fail-rbi-increases-capital-buffer-for-sbi-hdfc/articleshow/106361864.cms

She said it was granted “without any application of mind and in breach of the bank’s statutory duties”. The sanction, she said, is liable to be set aside as it was issued on “specious grounds” on “mere allegations of bribery and corruption” without considering the underlying evidence, including witness statements, and is also “self-contradictory”. If not set aside, it would sound the “death knell” for the fundamental right to life and liberty, she said.The petition said Kochhar was named on many “prestigious power lists”, including Time magazine’s ‘100 most influential people in the world’ in 2015, and was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2011 and the ‘Woodrow Wilson Award for Global Corporate Citizenship’ by Wilson Centre at Washington, DC.Kochhar also challenged all actions taken pursuant to the sanction, including orders by a special CBI court in the CBI case against Videocon.The CBI registered a preliminary enquiry against her in December 2017. In January 2019, it filed an FIR against her and her husband, Deepak Kochhar, for alleged offences of cheating and criminal conspiracy, and under the Prevention of Corruption Act. In September 2020, the ED arrested Deepak and attached his properties in proceedings initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on the basis of the CBI’s FIR. The HC granted bail to Deepak in March 2021, observing that there was no loss caused to the bank due to his actions, and in January 2022, the SC dismissed a special leave petition filed by the ED against the HC relief.Kochhar said she received summons from the CBI in July last year and when she appeared before it on December 23, 2022, while Deepak was “preoccupied” with legal matters, she was arrested on the grounds that she was not cooperating with the probe. The Kochhars challenged the arrest as illegal and sought quashing of the FIR. In January, the HC granted the couple interim bail, holding that Kochhar’s arrest did not comply with a legal mandate that she be issued a notice first, said her plea.

The horse has gone away for the last 4-5 years. On Wednesday, the man who rode the horse with pride down city streets each morning for over four decades also passed away.The bank came up at the spot some 10 years ago ago. Before that, the sprawling Chandak Bhavan bungalow — the house of Chandak family — stood facing the road. A horse with a shining coat could be seen right at the entrance. Every morning, dressed in white riding gear and black boots, Jugalkishore Chandak rode out of his house. The horses changed from Laxmi to Chandni, Roshni to Badal over the last 42 years. But his routine was a constant.105641602 The rest of the day, Chandak could be found at the M Chandak consumer durables store at Sitabuldi, where the friendly businessman interacted with customers.Taking different routes each day, Chandak had become a familiar face for many as ‘Ghodewale Chandak’. Each day, Chandak attracted the awe of morning walkers and commuters, controlling the animal with a gentle word as a bike or car zoomed by. During elections, Chandak made it a point to ride his horse to the polling booth and cast his vote. Chandak saddled the horse every morning till some time in mid 2017. “A spine injury after he slipped in the bathroom forced him to give up riding. The last horse he had, named Badal, died some days after he gave up riding,” says his son Manish Chandak. “My father was not keeping well lately and died at home,” he added.“Those days there used to be a riding school near the CP Club. One day, he along with two friends saw the training. They were so impressed that they joined the riding school. That was before our marriage,” says his wife Kantadevi. The riding trips made him so famous that he was often invited home by top officials, including a couple of police commissioners, says his nephew Vinay Chandak. “All the children in family were taught riding. We used to follow him in a car or two-wheelers during the ride. I remember people used to wave at him. At times, a curious commuter would even stop and inquire about the breed and other details,” said Vinay. After extensive research on equestrian sports, Chandak had purchased a mare from Rajasthan, named Laxmi. After it came Chandni, then came Roshni, and finally Badal, said a family member. Except Badal, all were mares, said the kin.Anant Daksindas, who lives close by, remembers seeing him every morning, but cannot recall when he stopped riding by in the last few years.“I remember the night when the mare started violently stomping her hoof. My father rushed out and soon we felt tremors. That was the day a massive earthquake struck Latur. Shocks were felt in the city too,” recalls Chandak’s daughter Sheetal.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/chandak-remembering-nagpurs-maverick-horserider/articleshow/105641604.cms

During the inspection, RBI found that the bank had given loan","MUMBAI: The RBI has imposed a record penalty of nearly Rs 12.2 crore on ICICI Bank for violation of lending rules and delays in reporting fraud. The penalty on ICICI Bank is bigger than the Rs 10-crore fine imposed on HDFC Bank in May 2021 for irregularities in auto loans. The penality is also higher than the total fines levied on private banks in FY23, totalling Rs 12.17 crore. RBI inspected the books of ICICI Bank in 2020 and 2021 to evaluate its financial status. During the inspection, RBI found that the bank had given loans to companies where two of the lender’s directors held board positions — in violation of RBI guidelines. The bank also marketed and sold non-financial products, which are outside the remit of a commercial bank. Third, ICICI Bank failed to report frauds to RBI in time. Following the detection of these irregularities, RBI served the bank a show-cause notice.“After considering the bank’s reply to the notice, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and additional submissions made by it, RBI came to the conclusion that the charge of non-compliance with the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act and RBI directions was substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty on the bank,” the central bank said. The regulator has also fined Kotak Mahindra Bank nearly Rs 4 crore for violating rules on risk management, outsourcing, recovery agents, and loan management. RBI inspected Kotak Bank’s financial position as of March 2022. The regulator found multiple irregularities: The bank did not review or check the operations of its service providers. The bank had also violated RBI directions that customers should not be contacted after 7pm and before 7am for loan recovery. Other violation of consumer protection norms included charging interest from the date of loan approval rather than the date of actual disbursement, which violates loan terms. The private bank was found to be levying a prepayment penalty on small borrowers even though the terms of the loan did not have any provision for such fines. After following the due process of issuing a show-cause notice to Kotak Bank, RBI decided that the charges of non-compliance with RBI directions was substantiated and warranted the imposition of penalty on the bank.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-slaps-record-rs-12-crore-fine-on-icici-bank-over-lapses/articleshow/104507599.cms

The high court's decision was upheld by ,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday declined to consider the petition of Chanda Kochhar, former managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, who was seeking retirement benefits from the bank. Justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti, presiding over the bench, stated that it was not a case warranting interference, expressing their disinclination to challenge the high court's decision. Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Kochhar, pointed out that the high court had dismissed the petition without any discussion or findings.The bench, after reviewing the facts, maintained that there was no justification for interference. Kochhar contested the May 3 order of the Bombay High Court, which rejected her petition, asserting that granting interim relief would harm the bank irreparably. Another Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice Bela M Trivedi, postponed the hearing on a separate plea filed by the CBI challenging the interim bail granted to Kochhar; the plea will now be heard on December 11.In her quest for retirement benefits from ICICI Bank, Kochhar cited various documents and court orders, contending that no prima facie case was established in the bank's lawsuit. She also referred to the November 2022 order of the high court's single judge bench, which directed her not to deal with the Rs 6.90 lakh worth of shares she acquired in 2018.Kochhar's plea before the high court sought the specific performance of entitlements and benefits provided to her when the bank accepted her early retirement in 2018. She argued that the bank could not terminate someone who had already retired. The unconditional benefits included employee stock options exercisable until 2028.In May 2018, an inquiry was initiated against Kochhar by the bank following a complaint about her alleged involvement in granting out-of-turn loans worth Rs 3,250 crore to the Videocon Group, benefiting her husband, Deepak Kochhar. After going on leave, Kochhar applied for early retirement, which the bank accepted, treating it as a 'Termination for Cause' and seeking regulatory approval from the Reserve Bank of India for her termination, as mandated by the RBI Act.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-dismisses-chanda-kochhars-plea-for-retirement-benefits-from-icici-bank/articleshow/105840869.cms

The bank was ordered to pay him 41,691 rupees in rewar","CHENNAI: It is the festive season, and online retailers are offering reward points for every purchase. But what will you do if your bank denies it to you? A man from Chennai fought a legal battle against ICICI Bank for two years and got his compensation.The District Consumer Disputes Grievance Redressal Commission has ordered ICICI to not only pay 41,691 in lieu of reward points but also another 35,000 for deficiency in service, compensation for mental agony caused, and litigation expenses.In March 2021, D Sylvester Arokiaraj had bought jewellery worth 8.89 lakh on Amazon using his ICICI credit card, and the e-commerce site had rewarded him with 41,961 points for the purchase. One point is equivalent to one rupee.But these reward points did not reflect on Arokiaraj's monthly bank statement. Despite repeated complaints, there was no reasonable explanation, and his credit card was blocked two weeks down the line without any prior information, he said in his petition filed before the District (Kancheepuram) Consumer Disputes Grievance Redressal Commission.A few days later, Arokiaraj received a reply from the bank stating that the card was blocked and reward points had been put on hold because it was used for 'business or commercial' purposes. The bank informed him that gold purchases on Amazon are eligible for 0% rewards.However, Arokiaraj argued in the commission that the transaction was solely for personal use and has not caused any default in the payment of the outstanding amount for the said credit card.The bank neither replied to his subsequent complaints regarding them nor appeared before the commission to submit its explanation. So in the bank's absence, the commission decided to dispose of Arokiaraj's complaint on merit and ordered compensation.

ICICI,2023-10-23T04:43:00+05:30,Mayur Shetty,Private banks tighten vigilance on small unsecured loans,India Business News: Banks in India are seeing a rise in stress related to small unsecured personal loans as borrowers with low incomes struggle to repay their debts. Yes ,"MUMBAI: Small loans may turn out to be a big worry for banks. Some lenders are seeing stress rise in small-ticket unsecured personal loans as borrowers with low incomes find it hard to repay dues. RBI has flagged concerns over an increase in unsecured loans. While Yes Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank said delinquencies are higher than last year, ICICI Bank has said that borrowers who are falling behind delinquencies are in the below Rs 50,000 segment where the bank does not have a significant presence. ""On the unsecured loans, we have seen slight deterioration. These are early days, but we do find that delinquency is on a rising trend. Compared to six months ago, we are seeing a larger part of the portfolio in the 30-plus days past due (category),"" said Yes Bank MD & CEO Prashant Kumar. Kumar, who was addressing reporters after the bank's Q2FY24 results, said that the bank has already taken the necessary steps to tighten underwriting policy. ""When we reach a proper mix of the retail to total loan, I think we will need to lower the growth rate of retail,"" he said. Yes bank reported a net profit of Rs 115 crore for Q2FY24 - an increase of 47% over the previous year. Kotak Mahindra Bank MD & CEO Dipak Gupta said that delinquencies in the unsecured segment are higher than 12 months ago, but it is still lower than the pre-Covid days. He said that the build-up of risk could never be ruled out and the bank was growing its business and had its foot over both the accelerator and the brakes. ICICI Bank executive director Sandeep Batra said the bank's unsecured portfolio is not seeing any additional stress as the lender focuses on existing customers, mostly salaried employees with corporates and the public sector. Batra said that the build-up of stress that analyst reports are referring to is on the low-ticket size with loans of Rs 50,000 and below, where affordability and repaying capacity are a constraint. ""As far as our bank is concerned, we do not have a meaningful exposure in this segment. We are monitoring this segment and continue to give loans within our threshold,"" said Batra. ICICI Bank is also monitoring the jobs situation in its borrower group to identify any early signs of stress. In the post-policy press conference, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said, ""Certain components of personal loans are, however, recording very high growth. These are being closely monitored by RBI for any signs of incipient stress.""'RBL Bank, another private lender that announced its results on Saturday, said it had decided to make Rs 252-crore contingent provisions on unsecured loans and its credit card portfolio.'The bank has also decided to make full provisions for credit card defaults at the end of 120 days past due as against 180 days earlier. RBL Bank MD & CEO R Subramaniakumar said there is no increase in delinquencies and that the portfolio is performing well.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/private-banks-tighten-vigilance-on-small-unsecured-loans/articleshow/104636068.cms

Arcion Revitalization, originally promoted by Apollo Global and ICICI Bank, has become the latest firm to relinquish its license for an asset reconstruction company (ARC). In January of this year, Lonestar had surrendered its ARC license. In 2020, amid the pandemic, KKR had abandoned its 'firm' intentions to establish an ARC. ""In emerging economies, foreign capital has played a key role in cleansing the non-performing loans market and releasing blocked domestic capital. Probably, there is a need for a more liberalised environment to facilitate ease of doing business in the stressed asset market,"" said Hari Hara Mishra, CEO of the Association of ARCs in India.Bankers say there are various reasons for the flight of foreign investors. The increase in the capital requirement for these companies - from Rs 2 crore in 2016 to Rs 100 crore, which was to be achieved by 2019 - is a major factor. Last year, the capital requirement was raised to Rs 300 crore by April 2026.The second reason is the government's decision to establish the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL), which enjoys government backing and guarantees. Private players found it challenging to compete for assets with NARCL given the government's support. Around 29 companies were granted a licence by RBI. Of this, the active foreign players are JC Flowers and ACRE. RBI announced that Arcion had surrendered its certificate of registration, marking its exit from the asset reconstruction business. The certificate has been cancelled as of August 28. Apollo Global, KKR and Lonestar continue to be major players in the bad loan business globally. International funds are also crucial players in the bad loans business because they have deep pockets.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/another-international-company-gives-up-its-asset-rejig-business-licence/articleshow/103616984.cms

Indranil Acharya, zonal head (investigation) ICICI Bank, made students aware of fraudsters taking control of bank accounts. “These accounts-on-rent are being used for crypto currency and investment fraud cases,” said Acharya. Bongaon police superintendent Joyeeta Bose said that due to vast usage of the internet without adequate knowledge, students are at times falling prey to cyber fraud. Bongaon police’s office-in-charge (cyber cell) Sudipta Dey, during his session, stressed that everyone should lock their social media profile and should refrain from sharing personal photos to their virtual “friends”. He shared a case study wherein a girl became victim of online fraud by accepting a friend request from an unknown source. Chittaranjan Das, the college principal, said, “Though youngsters nowadays are very much aware of the use of various electronic media and gadgets, they still fall prey to the incidents of cyber fraud.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/icici-bank-cops-alert-students-on-fin-frauds/articleshow/102555854.cms

The matter will come up for hearing on August 2.In the chargesheet, the CBI said after Chanda Kochhar's appointment as ICICI Bank MD and CEO was announced in December 2008, the accused conspired with her to get loans sanctioned to the financially-beleaguered Videocon group. Loans were extended from time to time in lieu of illegal gratification of Rs 64 crore paid in the guise of investment in M/s Nupower Renewables Limited, the Kochhars' company.The CBI claims an apartment in Churchgate, where the Kochhars were staying, was also among the inducements. The CBI said ""a flat of almost like area was sold in this society for Rs 16 crore in 2014 and for Rs 18.5 crore in 2017"", whereas Chanda Kochhar got the flat transferred in October 2016 for Rs 11 lakh only. ""It is worthwhile to mention herein that her son Arjun Kochhar purchased a flat of like area on the same floor for Rs 19.1 crore on November 12, 2021,"" said the chargesheet.The CBI claimed its investigation revealed that the Kochhars' apartment in CCI Chambers was owned by Videocon during the relevant period. Deepak Kochhar, in conspiracy with Dhoot, purchased shares of Quality Appliance (company that owned the apartment worth Rs 5.3 crore in 1996) for only Rs 11 lakh when various loan proposals of Videocon were under consideration in ICICI Bank.In all, after Kochhar assumed the CEO's role in May 2009, the CBI said six rupee-term loans were given to Videocon, and all were sanctioned by the Committee of Directors headed by Chanda Kochhar in violation of guidelines and ICICI Bank's credit policy.The chargesheet also named Dhoot's nephew, Saurabh, and a CA, Dattatraya Kadam. Videocon Industries Limited, NuPower Renewables Limited and Supreme Energy Private Limited are the companies named in it.The CBI said Deepak Kochhar was the director and sole authorised signatory of NuPower Renewables. He accepted a cheque dated August 20, 2009, for Rs 64 crore from Dhoot, CMD of Videocon. The cheque came after a Rs 300-crore loan was sanctioned on August 26, 2008, by a committee headed by Chanda Kochhar in favour of a non-business entity of Videocon group, Videocon International Electronics Limited.The CBI alleged that the Dhoots, in criminal conspiracy with the other accused, convinced the ICICI Bank that the loans would be used for capital expenditure. But the loan amount was diverted.The CBI probe showed the Rs 251 crore shown to have been paid on November 2012 as pre-payment of the Rs 300-crore loan came from fresh finance of Rs 1,730 crore sanctioned by ICICI under a debt consolidation and capex scheme.

At this, Deepak Kochhar “became very angry and told Dhoot that (sic) listen to his advice otherwise he would ruin him,” the witness said.

He has allowed him to stay free of cost, it does not mean it is Deepak’s flat. Deepak Kochhar became infuriated and told V N Dhoot to sell all the shares of Quality Appliance Pvt Ltd at face value of Rs 11 lakh, this way flat would be transferred to his family trust Quality Advisor, otherwise Chanda would declare his loan accounts NPA.”The chargesheet also said there was trust deficit between Dhoot and Deepak, because of which the former earlier appointed his proxy along with an ex-BMC chief on the board of the latter’s company. A witness told CBI that sometime in 2010, Dhoot told him that as he had made an investment of Rs 64 crore in NuPower Renewables Ltd (NRL), Deepak Kochhar was following up with him for more investments to increase wind power capacity. At that time, Videocon Group had started facing a financial crunch, due to which Dhoot was hesitant to make any more investments in NRL through his subsidiary Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd (SEPL).The witness said, “To avoid the uncomfortable situation with Deepak Kochhar, he (Dhoot) told me that on paper (being proxy shareholder for V Dhoot), he will sell his Equity Shares in SEPL to me. Dhoot had already resigned from the directorship of SEPL, but to control and safeguard his investment in the company, he got me and one Karun Chandra Srivastava (IAS, ex-chief of BMC) appointed on the board of NRL in 2009.” In 2009, Dhoot invested Rs 64 crore in SEPL in the form of a loan from Videocon Industries Ltd.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/deepak-told-v-n-dhoot-to-listen-or-hed-ruin-him/articleshow/102463763.cms

HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank led the slide. On the NSE, the nifty lost 207 points or 1% to close at 19,527 points.The weakness in the global markets also affected the rupee that closed at 82.57 to the dollar, weaker by 32 paise from its Tuesday close.

Economists and analysts expect the US 10-year yield to rise, which in turn could lead to some shift of investor interest away from risky assets like emerging market stocks, including Indian shares.The day’s selling on Dalal Street came on the back of heavy offloading by foreign funds, market players said. According to them, Fitch’s decision to downgrade, along with weak economic data from the US, the EU and China, led to a rise in risk-off trades among traders and investors around the world, including in India.According to Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services, the Indian market witnessed a broad sectoral slide on the back of weak global market trends. “Negative news regarding the US rating downgrade on fiscal concerns, coupled with weak factory activity data from Eurozone and China, led to widespread worries across the globe.” Additionally, selling by FPIs, triggered by a rise in US bond yields, has disrupted the mood of the domestic market, he said.As a reaction to Fitch’s decision on the US, on Wednesday Nikkei in Japan closed 2.3% lower while Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 2.5% and FTSE in the US was down 1.4% in late-session.

The boards approved the delisting of ISec on June 29, 2023 through a unique share-swap arrangement in which ISec shareholders will be issued 67 equity shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 equity shares of ICICI Securities.In a letter to the board members of ISec, the minority shareholder, who has requested anonymity, said ISec went public in March 2018 with profits of Rs 550 crore, implying a trailing valuation of 30 times earnings and a book value multiple of 20. In five years since listing, sales and profits have almost doubled (grown 84% and 102% respectively). While earnings compounded by 15% CAGR at the least, the implied trailing multiple is pegged at 18 times earnings and a book value multiple of 7 (as per closing price June 30, 2023), based on the approved swap ratio.Why is the proposed exit multiple lower than the entry multiple at the time of IPO, considering the overall business quality has significantly improved? - the minority shareholder asked. Since the delisting proposal forces minority shareholders to give up the potential upside, does the swap ratio consider the opportunity cost and time they invested while the business was being nurtured? Or has at least the additional risk premium associated with the share swap been considered while arriving at the fair value of the share?“The implied exit multiple results in a 4% price CAGR since the IPO, substantially lower than the growth in earnings at 15% CAGR. As minority shareholders, we strongly believe in the business’s growth prospects and find this unfair. There is no mechanism of reverse book building leading to the discovery of fair value or options available to minority shareholders who do not wish to participate,” the letter said. The reason cited for the ‘scheme of arrangement’ is - access to a larger and more diversified business with greater stability, liquidity and the ability to better capitalize on the synergies in line with the Customer 360-degree focus of ICICI Bank. “These reasons are powerful and explain the benefits to an ICICI Bank shareholder, but to a minority shareholder of ISec, they have almost no relevance at all. An investor can directly participate in ICICI Bank for the above-mentioned reasons, but it must be our choice to make,” the letter said.According to market sources, public shareholders hold around 11% in ISec but a bigger role needs to be played by institutional holders. Institutional investors (LIC, Mutual Funds and Foreign Institutions) should not only get a chance to actively participate in the price discovery of ICICI Securities for delisting as is available in any other delisting process, but they should also engage vigorously with ICICI Bank to obtain the fair value of the business.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/minority-shareholder-prods-board-over-delisting-isec/articleshow/101771483.cms

For the first time, the index ","MUMBAI: Posting their quickest gains, the sensex and investor wealth hit record highs on Monday, riding on foreign fund buying. For the first time, the index breached the 65,000 mark, hopping from the 64,000 level in just one session, even as the value of Indian stocks on the BSE crossed Rs 300 lakh crore in just over two years after topping the Rs 200-lakh-crore milestone.The sensex recorded an all-time high for the third session in a row on Monday as it rose nearly 1%, or 486 points, to 65,205, led by gains in Reliance, ITC and the HDFC twins. The sensex breached the 65,000-level early in the day on the back of positive cues from US markets.According to analysts, sustained buying by foreign investors is a key reason for Indian stocks' resurgence in recent months. In the first six months of 2023, foreign institutional investors have net invested Rs 88,256 crore in equities. In 2022, these investors had sold over Rs 1.2 lakh crore worth of stocks. Since its March 24 low of 57,527, the sensex has surged over 13%.

This translates to around $3.7 trillion - ranking India 5th in terms of market valuation between Hong Kong ($5.1 trillion) and France ($3.3 trillion).Steady corporate earnings and robust macroeconomic fundamentals have supported the rally, analysts said, apart from global factors. A stable rupee, which rose 8 paise to close at 81.96 against the dollar on Monday, along with moderating inflation too have positively impacted the markets. 101470594""Global markets, which had expected a US recession by mid-2023, have been proved wrong and are now compensating for the excessive pessimistic discounting in 2022. The US rally is being led by a handful of tech stocks while it is more broad-based in India,"" V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services said. He attributed the surge in foreign fund inflows to the ""sell China, buy India"" strategy which is evolving in the US.On a year-to-date basis, investor wealth has gained by Rs 15 lakh crore. The rise in BSE market cap has come despite a nearly Rs 10-lakh-crore drop in Adani stocks' valuation over the same period in the wake of a critical report by US short-seller Hindenburg. In addition to a flood of foreign funds, the monsoon covering most parts of the country last week too lifted investor sentiments. ""India is performing well on most economic parameters and that could strengthen the fund flows in the near term,"" Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said.Market players said that though the rally may continue for a short while, valuations in some sectors have started getting stretched. When the BSE market cap crossed Rs 200 lakh crore in February 2021, the sensex's price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, an indicator of valuation, was near 35. The sensex's current PE ratio is at 24, according to the BSE website, , which is close to its 2017-20 average.Due to robust profit growth potential and increased demand from domestic and global investors, Indian shares remain appealing despite high relative valuations.

There are several reasons for this surge, including strong foreign investor inflows, revival of monsoon, and positive economic indicators such as strong GDP growth and low inflation.Foreign investors bet big on IndiaOne of the primary reasons for the recent surge is flow of foreign investors' money into Indian stock markets. Foreign investors have been net buyers of Indian equities in recent months, pumping in billions of dollars into the market.According to report in the Economic Times, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) made a significant investment of ₹2.9 lakh crore in Indian equities on a gross basis in June. This amount sets a new monthly record, surpassing the previous high of ₹2.55 lakh crore invested in December 2020. This is a vote of confidence in the Indian economy and its long-term growth prospects.""After key benchmark indices scaled fresh peaks last week, investors are hoping that FIIs would continue to increase exposure to Indian markets, given the strong growth trajectory. India's record GST collections for the month of June further signifies the improving economic growth momentum,"" Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, told PTI.""Sentiments of investors are reinforced by positive domestic data and optimistic global cues. The global market was supported by resilient economic data, avoiding the possibility of a recession. India's stock market trend was broad-based, owing to the outperformance from energy, financial, metal, and FMCG sectors,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Monsoon revivalThe investor sentiment is also riding high due to possibility of India likely to experience another year of normal monsoon conditions. The southwest monsoon has already covered the entire country six days before the normal date, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday.On Friday, the IMD had said the monsoon is expected to be normal in July across the country, barring parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh and south Bihar.The monsoon holds significant importance as it serves as the lifeblood of India's $3 trillion economy. A plentiful monsoon in July would alleviate concerns regarding summer crop yields and bring about higher incomes in the rural areas.""The market's record-breaking momentum continued as the robust June GST collections, and the monsoon covering most parts of the country in the last few days brought cheers to investors. The rally has been mostly due to strong foreign fund inflows and India performing well on most of the economic parameters could further strengthen the fund flows in the near term,"" Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities Ltd, told PTI.Cooling inflation: Inflation in India has been on the decline in recent months, giving the RBI room to pause its interest rate hike cycle. This is positive for businesses and consumers, as it will lead to lower borrowing costs and boost spending.Strong corporate earnings: Corporate earnings in India have been growing steadily in recent quarters, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming quarters.

The board recommended a dividend of eight rupees per share, subject to the shareholder approval.Net interest income rose 40.2% to Rs 17,667 crore, widening the net interest margin to 4.9% from 4%. Announcing the results, ICICI Bank’s executive director Sandeep Batra said the interest margins improve with rising interest as deposit rates are fixed and get repriced on maturity. Batra refuted reports that the bank faced a data breach, saying, “This is a totally baseless, mischievous and false claim.”“There has been a significant formalisation of small businesses following the introduction of GST, and our ability to assess credit in this segment has increased,” said Batra. He added that ICICI Bank had not seen any impact of rising rates on home loan demand.

However, it is still not part of the payments l","Amazon Pay offers an entire range of financial services which includes payments, credit and insurance. However, it is still not part of the payments leaderboard in India. To get back into the leadership game in consumer payments, e-commerce giant Amazon’s digital payments arm is reportedly counting on the traditional mobile wallet business. According to a report by The Economic Times, after allowing interoperability in its wallets, the company is hoping to get transactions back on track. What is Amazon Pay Wallet interoperability? With this new function, Amazon Pay wallet users will be able to scan any QR code in the country. The company also noted that more mobile wallets are being activated every day, but users are not using these wallets to make transactions. Amazon Pay users are not using walletsAs per RBI’s data, in April 2023, Amazon Pay created 62.8 million wallets but they cumulatively reported only 3.8 million transactions that month. The number of wallets has gone up by 14% from 55 million in 2022. However, the transactions reported on the wallets have reduced by over 50% from around 8 million in April 2022.To compare, Paytm Payments Bank has more than 500 million wallets. Amazon Pay is also lagging behind the competition on Unified Payments Interface (UPI)-based transactions as well. NPCI data notes that Amazon Pay reported 57 million transactions in May 2023 and the number has been fairly stable over the last year or so.How Amazon Pay is planning to win back customersBy tapping the 100 million plus registered users in India in its e-commerce business, Amazon wants more users to utilise the payment platform. The company wants users to access Amazon Pay for bill payments, train ticket bookings and other daily transactions.“We are behind in the race in terms of share of transactions, but we have a large customer base and it is just about how we get them to use it and build a habit around it,” said Vikas Bansal, whole-time director, Amazon Pay India.He also added that the discoverability of the platform has been an issue as the payment platform is integrated into the larger e-commerce app, To address this issue, Amazon has built a shortcut that can take users directly from the home screen into the Amazon Pay micro app. Bansal hopes that this change will help boost adoption, yet the company is still not convinced about having a separate app for the payment platform.“That (separate app) is something we continue to debate internally—there are pros and cons. But we have one question in mind: how far are we able to solve the problems for our customers? And if it means that we need another app, then maybe we will,” Bansal said.Amazon’s plans for mobile walletsBansal noted that over 70% of daily UPI transactions are payments of a value of less than Rs 500. To keep their bank accounts clean, several customers prefer to use a wallet for such transactions and Amazon is planning to appeal to this set of users.Apart from Google, the other two tech majors—Meta-owned WhatsApp and Amazon—have both lagged in the consumer payments business. WhatsApp Pay’s failure has also seen its entire top India leadership leave, the report adds.Amazon Pay’s plans about credit and insurance optionsUnlike other payment apps, Amazon Pay started offering credit and insurance options much earlier. The company’s payment arm got the corporate agency licence back in 2019.Amazon Pay’s insurance business has not scaled up significantly, but the credit business has seen some progress. Bansal said that more than 10 million customers have been offered credit on the platform. The two major products offered by the platform are ICICI Bank-Amazon Pay credit cards and a buy-now-pay-later line for online purchases. Around 3 million ICICI Bank-Amazon Pay credit cards have been issued as of March 2022.Bansal noted that this card gets used a lot even outside the Amazon ecosystem. With active rates of more than 65 to 70%, this card is one of the most successful co-branded cards in the market, he added. Active rate is the number of people who use their cards more than once a month. However, Amazon did not share any details on the number of credit lines or the amount outstanding in this business. Offline channels and call centres still sell insurance very aggressively in India. Bansal mentioned that the insurance industry still needs time to mature and settle down. An entity like Amazon will be able to sell these products on a mass scale, through online channels only after the market is settled and mature. Currently, Amazon collaborates with Acko to offer motor insurance products.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/how-amazon-is-planning-to-boost-its-payment-business-in-india/articleshow/101023841.cms

The US markets ended in positive territory on Tuesday.""The domestic indices rebounded after an initial phase of profit booking, driven by encouraging WPI inflation data and positive global cues, while selling in IT and banking stocks kept a check on gains. The favourable decline in US inflation, driven by lower energy prices, and speculation about a potential pause in the Fed rate hike campaign, brought comfort to global equities.""However, the persistence of higher core inflation levels may compel the Fed to maintain its hawkish tone during today's policy announcement with an indication of a prolonged pause,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Global oil benchmark Brent crude climbed 1.08 per cent to USD 75.09 a barrel.Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 1,677.60 crore on Tuesday, according to exchange data.Climbing for the second straight session, the BSE benchmark had jumped 418.45 points or 0.67 per cent to settle at 63,143.16 on Tuesday.

In 2022, UPI payments and card transactions hit a milestone of Rs 149.5 lakh crore. These numbers show the growing popularity and acceptance of digital payments in the country. While the UPI offers convenience, and has become one of the most-popular payment modes, there’s also the risk of cybercrime. UPI-related frauds have been on the rise. To check the number of transactions and reduce the risk of big financial frauds, leading banks including HDFC Bank, State Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have implemented some restrictions on UPI transactions. These come as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has set guidelines to regulate the expanding digital payment ecosystem.What NPCI has to say about UPI transaction limitsNPCI has specified in its guidelines that individuals can initiate UPI payments up to Rs 1 lakh per day. However, this limit varies across different banks.BanksDaily transaction limitCanara BankRs 25,000State Bank of India (SBI)Rs 1 lakhHDFC BankRs 1 lakh (Rs 5,000 for new users)ICICI BankRs 1 lakhAxis BankRs 1 lakhBank of BarodaRs 25,000Apart from monetary limits, NPCI has also restricted the number of transactions users can make per day. As per the new regulations, users can conduct up to 20 UPI transactions within 24 hours. Users have to wait for 24 hours before initiating further transactions once this limit has been reached. It is also important to note that specific transaction limits may vary across different banks.Transaction limits in popular UPI appsPopular UPI apps, including Paytm, Google Pay and Amazon Pay UPI, have also established a daily transaction limit of Rs 1 lakh. Moreover, there is a cumulative limit of up to ten transactions across all UPI apps and bank accounts. Google Pay has also implemented a precautionary measure. Under this, the daily transaction limit is temporarily halted if someone sends money requests of Rs 2,000 and above. Similarly, Amazon Pay UPI also restricts new customers to transact only Rs 5,000 within the first 24 hours.Growth of UPI digital transactions UPI transactions witnessed significant growth in May as they reached an all-time high of Rs 14.3 lakh crore in terms of value and 9.41 billion in volume. This represents a 2% growth in value compared to April's figure of Rs 14.07 lakh crore while the transaction volume increased by 6% as it went up from 8.89 billion to 9.41 billion.Untitled Carousel 100425777 100710473As per NPCI’s data, transactions worth approximately Rs 3.96 lakh crore were conducted in the last 10 days of May. To compare the amount with May of the previous financial year (2022-23), the volume of transactions has grown by 58%, while the overall value has surged by 37%.This surge in UPI transactions comes as the government is also actively promoting the adoption of digital payments to process tax collection across various sectors.

The upgrade is available for all passengers, visitors coming to see their families off, those coming to the airport for meetings and parking their vehicles at Terminal 2. 100464332FASTag is an electronic toll collection system. Private sector lender ICICI Bank has enabled FASTag-based payment for parking at the city airport. The facility allows FASTag users of any bank to pay the parking charges digitally and in a contactless manner, resulting in quicker movement of vehicles in the parking zone. The scanners installed at the parking zone read the FASTag affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle, record the entry/ exit time and deduct the parking charges automatically. “To facilitate quick movement, SVPIA has designated one lane at the entry and one at the exit for passengers using the FASTag option. With FASTag, the movement of the vehicle at parking will be fast, thus helping to save time and fuel. One of the main advantages of FASTag is that it eliminates the need for cash transactions, which would mean quicker parking options for all,” said an SVPIA spokesperson. “Travellers using parking with FASTag must ensure that their FASTag is active with sufficient balance to make an exit. Additionally, passengers entering the designated FASTag lane must follow the same lane to exit,” the airport spokesperson said. “Passengers must pay the standard rate, and no additional cost is applicable for the new parking facility.” Sudipta Roy, head, credit cards, payment solutions and merchant ecosystem, ICICI Bank, said, “We are delighted to introduce FASTag-based payment for parking at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad.

The move makes the food del,"Gurugram-based Zomato has become the first online food and grocery delivery app to offer UPI services for some of its users in India. For the uninitiated, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system which is developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). This service helps users to transfer money amongst users directly from their phones using a UPI PIN on supporting apps. Google Pay, Paytm and PhonePe are some of the top players in the UPI service. Zomato has partnered with ICICI Bank to offer the service. The new service will allow users to make both merchants as well as peer-to-peer payments.E-commerce apps offering UPIReports from September 2022 suggested that both Zomato and Swiggy were planning to introduce their own UPI offerings for digital payments on their platforms. According to a report by Economic Times (ET), the e-tailer platform Flipkart has also started working on its own UPI offering. Both Zomato and Flipkart are aimed to offer an improved user experience through their own UPI offerings. To operate and offer digital payment services like e-wallets, payment gateway services, and others, Zomato set up a subsidiary named Zomato Payments Pvt Ltd. in August 2021. Swiggy partnered with ICICI Bank to launch its digital wallet, Swiggy Money in 2020.

In an attempt to reduce dependency on Walmart-owned PhonePe and Google’s Gpay, NPCI is trying to diversify the UPI sector by bringing in other consumer internet companies to the network. PhonePe and GPay together hold over 80% market share. Intending to break the domination of these apps, NPCI has also proposed a cap on the market share of payment volumes for third-party apps.Untitled Carousel 99753006 99859859The regulatory body also proposed a 30% cap on market share which it planned to implement from December 31, 2022. However, those plans have now been deferred by two years.As per the report, a source aware of the developments said, “There is a longer-term incentive for consumer internet companies to have their own UPI offering instead of depending on other payment aggregators. For companies that see millions of transactions every year, having your payment product is a way of hedging against any potential merchant commissions that may be imposed in the future.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/zomato-launches-its-upi-services-what-it-means-for-users/articleshow/100277461.cms

He said the finance ministry is seriously contemplating to bring out an order that would link parking government funds in private banks to their performance in promoting such schemes. Even as the private sector’s achievement was seen as minimal on this front, the minister also hit out at government banks. He said banks in Vidarbha region lagged behind considerably as compared to the other pockets of the country. Even their performance was in the range of 12% to 26% of the eligible accounts. Karad was addressing a review meeting of the state level bankers’ committee (SLBC) on the banks’ performance in implementation of financial inclusion schemes under the Pradhan Mantri (PM) Yojana series and other plans. These include Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan, Surakhsa Bhima, Jeevan Suraksha and other plans including the Atal Pension Scheme (APS). The meeting was also attended by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.Gadkari said the career growth of the employees should be linked with performance in pushing government schemes.Karad said. “Private banks leave no effort to bag government deposits, but when it comes to pushing schemes, they are least bothered. Getting government deposits should depend on their performance in implementing the schemes.”At the insistence of Fadnavis, bank-wise performance of Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Suraksha Yojana (PMJSY) was seen in Yavatmal. It was found that the share of private banks like Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank was among the lowest. It ranged form less than one percent to 2% of the eligible accounts. There is a personal accident cover of Rs 2 lakh available for Rs 20. “All the banks have to do is to convince Jan Dhan account holders that Rs 20 will be debited from their accounts and they would get an insurance. It’s certainly not a great task.” he said. The overall performance in financial inclusion schemes is at 35% of the target in Vidarbha. There are schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana where banks have done well , he added.NPAs in mudra loans  NPAs in mudra loans was also raised. Bankers said the NPAs are up to 20% and even higher in some of the counts. These are collateral free loans ranging from Rs 50,000 to 10 lakh under different categories. There have been lapses in client selections. Bankers under pressure to push the scheme were not able to do proper due diligence at times leading to high NPAs.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/pvt-banks-flayed-for-ignoring-govt-welfare-schemes/articleshow/100220736.cms

The airport has designated a dedicated lane at the entry (second lane), and exit (third lane), for passengers using the FASTag option. FASTag will eliminate the need for cash transactions, resulting in quicker parking options. Travellers with FASTag should ensure that their FASTag is active, and has sufficient balance for a seamless exit.Passengers entering through the designated FASTag lane at the entrance should follow the same corresponding lane at the exit. The airport has upgraded the signage at both entry and exit, to indicate the FASTag lane.The spokesperson explained that if a private car or SUV with FASTag enters the second lane, the entry time is noted automatically, and the first 10 minutes are free. From the 11th minute to the 40th minute after entry, the charges as applicable will apply. If a private car or SUV stays inside the airport premises for a total of 40 minutes (including the first 10 minutes), it costs Rs 60. The parking charges vary for other types of vehicles.

Team led by Chanda Kochhar as MD of the Bank approved the loan only on a corporate guarantee. While the loan was under consideration Dhoot in a ""quid pro quo"" issued a cheque of Rs 64 crore in favor of Nupower Renewables Ltd. (Run by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar) from the account of his company Supreme Energy Pvt. Ltd (SEPL) which had a balance of only Rs 34,702. Once the loan was encashed, the amount also reached NuPower.The CBI in its grounds for arrest said Dhoot is named as accused, along with the Kochhars in its January 22, 2019 FIR for offences of cheating, criminal conspiracy and under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The CBI said Dhoot “has been inconsistent in his statement before the Investigating officer and has kept on changing his version and as such has not cooperated with the investigation in disclosing the full and true facts of the case.’’Dhoot’s counsel Sandeep Ladda, said arrest was not warranted and despite assuring the CBI of his presence on December 26 in response to its section 41A notice under the criminal procedure code (CrPC) (which is issued when an offence attracts up to seven years’ imprisonment and arrest is not required, to enable the accused to come and give an explanation), the CBI however immediately arrested him. Ladda said Dhoot was and had been cooperating from the start.On January 9, the HC held Kochhars' arrest of December 23, 2022 in the case to be non compliant with the legal mandate and said the CBI had arrested without any application of mind.The HC had then said, ""Courts have time and again reiterated the role of courts in protecting personal liberty and ensuring that investigations are not used as a tool of harassment,’’ observed the HC holding that the grounds for arresting the Kochhars was “unacceptable’’ and also “contrary’’ to the reasons for which a person can be arrested under law.The CBI said Dhoot’s arrest was lawful, complying with the procedural provisions. In its arguments before the HC, senior counsel Raja Thakare with advocate Kuldeep Patil for CBI also said Dhoot’s arrest was necessary to enable confrontation with two co-accused, the Kochhars.  The interrogation following arrest has revealed “new incriminating circumstances and evidence” said the CBI and Dhoot’s release would “jeopardise’’ the probe done so far and one, ongoing.If accused are interrogated without arrest in such cases where public money is involved, they confer with each other and align what they have to say, but in custodial interrogation they have no opportunity to consider what to say and start putting the blame on the other accused, Thakare had submitted before the bench on January 13.CBI said Dhoot “did not cooperate with the investigation’’ and “to avoid confrontation’’ with Kochhars, did not comply with its notice to appear when the couple was in their custody.Ladda, pointed out to the bench that the IO before arresting any person has to subjectively and objectively satisfy himself about the need of arrest and record reason and furnish the same to the accused as well as to court. The arrest memo doesn’t mention any such reasons further. IO has failed to produce case diaries in book format as per sec 172 of CrPC, and provision was also not followed nor verified by the Special Court.Thakare also said the special trial court Judge saw the case diary and, satisfied about the arrest, granted his custody on December 26 the day he was arrested.The CBI said investigation following arrest shows that it “transpired that Rs 64 crore was transferred to NuPower Renewables at Chanda Kochhar’s instance and further investigation to corroborate it is ongoing.’’ Also, CBI said “loan sanctioned to Videocon in 2012, was under consideration for restructuring in the 2016 and accused Deepak Kochhar was coercing to transfer the flat in CCI Chamber to his family trust for Rs 11 lakh else Chanda Kochhar would declare the account NPA.The HC also rejected and imposed cost of Rs 25, 000 on a lawyer who said “as advocate and vigilant citizens” had sought to intervene and oppose Dhoot’s petition and to also recall interim relief and bail granted on January 9 to the Kochhars. Advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay filed the intervention plea and through his advocate Subhash Jha argued that Dhoot ought to exhaust all his other statutory options including perhaps seeking bail before seeking relief under the extraordinary jurisdiction of the HC under Article 226—which empowers HC to pass orders to ensure and preserve fundamental rights.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-v-n-dhoot-in-icici-bank-loan-fraud-case/articleshow/97166149.cms

The charge under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code attracts a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.""If it is transpired to the investigating officer that any particular section is required to be added or deleted on the basis of material collected by him, he can very well add or delete the section and can intimate about it to the court.

While the Kocchars were granted bail by the Bombay high court this week, Dhoot is in judicial custody. Section 409 relates to criminal breach of trust by a public servant, banker, merchant or agent.The court also agreed with CBI special public prosecutor A Limosin's argument that at this stage, the accused is neither required to be heard nor does she have a locus on the plea. The defence was not directed to submit its reply though Chanda Kochhar had submitted one while in custody after the CBI's plea to invoke the charge on December 24, the day the Kochhars were arrested.The advocate for the accused submitted that within the narrow compass when the rights of the accused are affected, they have the limited right of being heard. ""Section 409 IPC was being added for extraneous purposes... it is a mala fide action to stop what is accruing to (her),"" her lawyer had said during the remand hearing.The CBI filed its FIR on January 22, 2019, against the Kochhars, Dhoot and Videocon as well as Supreme Energies Pvt Ltd for causing a loss of over Rs 1,730 crore to ICICI Bank by sanctioning loans to Videocon in contravention of the bank's rules and policies.The CBI alleged that Chanda Kochhar received Rs 64 crore kickbacks from Videocon for her own use (through an investment in her husband's firm).

Here the Dhoot family tried their luck in the uncharted territory of manufacturing conventional tube-based colour TV sets.Dhoot who had an engineering degree from the University of Pune set off to Japan for a year to be trained at electronics companies.In 1986, he founded Videocon International, which aimed at manufacturing 1,00,000 TV sets a year. It entered into technical collaboration with the Japanese major Toshiba and from here there was no looking back.From colour TV sets, Videcon in the 1990s expanded into other verticals, such as refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, home entertainment systems and other small appliances. It pushed contemporary rivals like Mirc Electronic (Onida), Salora, Weston etc with affordable pricing.Its TV models like Bazooka and Bazoomba were the market's favourites in the early 90s.After having success in its consumer electronics and home appliances business, Dhoot expanded Videocon Industries into other areas, such as Oil & Gas, cellular services and others.However, Dhoot's downfall started when it entered into the cellular service area with Videocon Telecommunications. It could launch commercial services only in 11 out of the 18 circles it held licences.In 2012, after the 2G spectrum case, the Supreme Court cancelled 122 licences issued by the central government in 2008, 21 licences belonged to Videocon. In the 2012 spectrum auction, Videocon won back licences in 6 circles but sold to the market leader Bharti Airtel and shut down operations.Moreover, in the late 90s South Korean giants like LG Electronics and Samsung entered the Indian market, which disrupted consumer electronics and appliances with the latest technology and quality products at affordable pricing.Though Videocon Industries had several verticals, its main cash cow was the consumer electronics and appliances business.As Videocon failed to face the challenges from rivals Sony, LG and Samsungs, its revenue got stagnated and gradually it sat on a pile of debt.Dhoot tried to pare debts by selling some of his assets. The company merged its DTH business with Dish TV. They sold ownership in some of their gas fields and telecom business, but it did not work.Finally, in 2018, it was dragged to the insolvency tribunal NCLT by its creditor. It owed around Rs 31,000 crore to the banks, including interests.At the request of lenders, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has conducted a consolidated corporate insolvency resolution process by combining Videocon Industries and the other 12 Videocon group companies.In June 2021, a bid of merely Rs 2,692 crore from billionaire Anil Agarwal's Twin Star Technologies to take over Videocon Industries was approved by the NCLT. This also went into controversy.Earlier this year, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had set aside Twin Star's Rs 2,692 crore bid, directing to invite fresh bids.Though it was challenged before the Supreme Court by Twin Star, the creditors of Videocon Industries are still looking for a buyer. According to some sources, the lenders may even consider liquidation, if they fail to find a buyer for the company, which once was a success story.

The top court was hearing the appeal by Yes Bank against a Bombay high court ruling that had set aside an administrator's decision to write off 84.5 billion rupees ($1.03 billion) of AT1 bonds in March 2020 after the Reserve Bank of India initiated a restructuring of the lender.The RBI had appointed the administrator to manage Yes Bank's affairs in March 2020 after its financial position seriously deteriorated.AT1 bonds are high-yield securities that typically have loss-absorbing features, meaning they can be written off if a lender's capital falls below a crucial level, which was invoked in Yes Bank's case.The State Bank of India, along with ICICI Bank , Axis Bank, IDFC FIRST Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Housing Development Finance Corp had stepped in to rescue the lender as a part of the restructuring exercise.At the hearing on Friday, the counsel for Yes Bank - Kapil Sibal - argued that the write-off in AT1 bonds was a part of a “well-thought of” restructuring exercise. Without the AT1 bond write-off, banks would not have infused funds in Yes Bank, Sibal added. The High Court, while pronouncing its decision on Jan. 20, had stayed the order for six weeks. The Supreme Court on Friday extended the High Court's stay until further orders.Meanwhile, the counsel for the RBI -- Solicitor General Tushar Mehta -- said that not extending the lower court's stay would mean that Yes Bank would become a non-viable lender again, and that would put the interest of many depositors in jeopardy.The counsel representing the bondholders – Mukul Rohatgi – argued that writing off the AT1 bonds was incorrect in law. Yes Bank’s administrator had no jurisdiction to write down the bonds, Rohatgi said.The Supreme Court will hear the case next on March 28.

A Vadodara consumer forum has asked Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd to pay the interest amount it charged to its customer who had sought to close his loan account. Rajnikant Panchmatia, a resident of Mujmahuda Road, had filed a case against the bank through Jagrut Nagrik in 2017. He said in his complaint that he had taken a property loan of Rs 40 lakh from the bank in 2015. In 2016, Panchmatia approached the bank with a demand draft of Rs 38 lakh on September 1, 2016 towards loan settlement and asked the bank to close his loan account. On September 27, 2016, he gave an application for a balance transfer of his loan. His account was closed on October 10, 2016, but the bank charged him Rs 54,292 interest for the days that it took to close the loan account. Panchmatia then approached the consumer forum and prayed that his demand draft for loan settlement was ready on August 31, 2016, but the bank didn’t accept it and asked him to wait for a foreclosure letter. Panchmatia further alleged that the bank delayed the loan closure process by 47 days due to which he had to pay the interest. The bank argued that Panchmatia asked for closing his loan account on September 1, 2016, but on September 27, 2016, he requested for transfer of the balance loan to ICICI Bank. Kotak Bank said that the new request led to them to initiate a different process which was over and ultimately the loan closure was completed on October 10, 2016. The bank also argued that it is not a private firm but a multi-national company that has to act as per rules and regulations and follow certain procedures. The bank said that it had extended financial benefit to Panchmatia by waiving the pre-payment charges of four percent of the outstanding loan. After hearing both parties, the Vadodara Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (additional) said that only the demand draft was required to be submitted along with the foreclosure proposal which was provided by the opponent. The forum observed that had the demand draft been accepted by the bank or had it permitted the complainant to deposit it in his loan account on September 1, 2016, then the loan account would have been closed on the same day. And, there wouldn’t have been any question of charging interest for the period thereafter.“We believe that in this age of fast communication and competition, the opponent could have accepted the demand draft and credited the same in the complainant’s loan account which is not done,” the forum said and added that it is deliberate and unreasonable conduct of the opponent and it is not just a deficiency in service but also negligence.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/bank-cant-charge-interest-for-delay-in-loan-a/c-closure/articleshow/98195618.cms

This has been weighing on investor sentiment globally which led to a nearly 3% fall in the Dow Jones and other leading Wall Street indices on Tuesday.According to Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, while some of the key US macro data pointed towards a stronger economy, inflation continued to remain stubbornly higher. As a result, “there is an increasing fear that the US Fed may remain hawkish for a longer duration than expected, which may even force the RBI to keep interest rates high”. In addition to these, statements from both Russian and US Presidents led to some increase in geopolitical tensions, which added to the current uncertainty in the markets, Khemka said in a note.The day’s slide also left investors poorer by Rs 4 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 264.6 lakh crore. Among the sensex constituents, Reliance Industries contributed the most to the index’s loss, followed by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. The day’s net selling figure by foreign funds came in at Rs 580 crore, BSE data showed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-dives-928-pts-over-fears-of-sharper-rate-hikes/articleshow/98166472.cms

In the month of January, mutual funds deployed close to Rs 12,500 crore, which is at highest in the last four months. The sector wise, they have added exposure in auto, auto and salaries, ITs, consumer staples and metals while they have reduced their exposure when it comes to financials, consumer discretionary and building materials. Also the cash level remained pretty much stable among all the mutual funds at around 4.7 percent of the total AVM. But what stocks they have added? In large cap, they have tech stocks and ICICI bank to their portfolio. Ambuja is one of the Adani Group stocks where one of the biggest selling was seen by mutual funds among large caps. Among mid caps, mutual funds have been adding stocks like Motherson Sumi wiring, Ashok Leyland and SAIL in the month of January while they have used the gains in Federal banks and REC as an opportunity to exit their stake in these counters. Among small caps, despite the gains that we have seen in South Indian bank and EPL in the month of January, mutual funds have not shied away from adding more stake in these two counters; while there has been a shift in shareholding from GMC projects to Kalpatru power of few mutual funds and that is because of the merger that we had seen between these two entities. Also the gains that we had seen in Heritage Foods and India Bulls Housing were used as an opportunity by mutual funds to reduce their stake. Also in the last three months, mutual funds have been continuously buying stocks like HUL, Airtel, ITC in large cap while they have been selling HCL Tech and metals like JSW steel, Hindustan zinc, Kohl India and Hindalco. In mid cap, they have been adding Bandhan Bank, Nykaa, SAIL while they have been reducing their stake in JSW Energy, Indian Bank and Solar Industries. Among small caps, they have been continuously adding VIP industries, Bikaji Foods which is recently listed, ITI and they have been reducing their stake in Sundaram Clayton and UTI AMC.

ICICI,2023-02-14T16:55:00+05:30,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,‘These 3 stocks can propel the auto index to new lifetime highs’,"India Business News: NEW DELHI: According to market observers, the automotive, information technology, and capital goods are sectors that will remain strong throughout the.","NEW DELHI: According to market observers, the automotive, information technology, and capital goods are sectors that will remain strong throughout the year. And among the auto sector, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti, and Tata Motors are anticipated to be the top performers. Gautam Shah, Goldilocks Premium Research, said that the only bright spot is the mid and small caps. He forecast the potential for the I.T. Index to rise by 10%. Here is what he shared with ET Now.We have been maintaining a cautious stroke bearish stance for a while now and I think there hasn't been any evidence on the table to suggest that we are turning around and we are going to reverse and start doing well once again because I think the market has really lost its leadership. The momentum on the upside is not there every single time the Nifty approaches an important resistance instead of that urge to actually break out it just finds selling pressure and this has happened repeatedly in the recent past. So currently, I think the battle lines are clearly drawn 17650 on the downside. 18,050 on the upside till we then don't get past this band. I don't think anything special is likely to play out and the fact that most of the developments or the events that markets were discounting in the price. So whether it's the Adani fiasco, whether it's the budget, the earnings, all of it is now in the price and therefore the market does not have any event to look forward to. However, having said that I don't think this is going to carry on for too long because currently the price action has been within the swing of the budget day. You know, it was a 600 point swing that day and since then the Nifty has been stuck in that band. So till we don't get past that swing, I don't think we are going to resolve into a trend. But my feel looking at the charts is that eventually the market will break down and see lower levels and therefore we maintain a cautious stance.I feel that there is always some excuse for the markets to fall. When we first started looking at the markets differently in late December, you didn't know what excuse is going to hit us and then it hit us obviously in the Adani fiasco. And I think let's not forget in the global equity basket, India has been one of the worst-performing markets in the world, sadly enough in the last two and a half months. This is a tag that we've not seen in three years and therefore clearly there is something wrong somewhere. I don't see too many names that can actually propel this market past 18,050 because banks are in a difficult space. Reliance is not doing too well. IT cannot carry the burden for too long. Stocks like ITC and L&T and Bhartis of the world have just risen too much and they don't have the momentum to scale greater heights. So the downside potential is far greater than the upside. The only bright spot is the mid caps and small caps. But even there we are getting a little concerned. I think second half of last year, we saw a phenomenal rally on the bank Nifty. I think we had levels of 44, 44, 500. It was great going. Everything participated and things just changed completely in the last one, one and a half months. I think there is a lot more room to fall. But the bank Nifty, once again, if you look at the last 5-6 days, it's not been able to take out that level of 42,000. So till that number does not get taken out, we would remain bearish. If you look at the leadership, ICICI bank and SBI, two of the poster boys of the last two years, they have stopped outperforming. And, HDFC bank as a stock market, they have stopped outperforming. And, HDFC bank as a stock has just got range bound and it's just languishing just below lifetime highs. Axis bank, IndusInd bank, and the PSU banks, obviously the Canara banks of the world, they all have negative setups. So I think banks and Reliance put together would be the reason for the market to break down if it were to happen sometime in the near term. Indeed. So smart money has to move somewhere. There has to be some place to hide in the marketplace. And that is IT. I think the price action has been excellent. While the Nifty has found it very difficult to sustain near resistance. If you look at the IT index, every time it come close to support level, we've seen a lovely rebound. I mean, look at what HCL Tech has done. Infosys, TCS, persistent in the mid cap space and many, many stocks in the entire IT basket, I think are setting up very well. So while there is potential for the Nifty to actually fall 10 percent from here, there's potential for the IT index to rise 10 percent. So that's how we have shuffled our stance. And we've been recommending our subscribers to be topped up in IT, Capital Goods, Auto and PSU. These are the four baskets that we like. Everything else is an avoid.About Auto stocksI think in a difficult market environment, they held out really well. Look at M&M, how it stood out. Maruti has been respecting support levels. Tata Motors has rebounded from a long term support. And I think all of these three stocks, which I mentioned, should do well and it should propel the auto index to new lifetime highs. If I'm not wrong, our working target has all along been about 15,000. So that's another 10-12% from where the index is right now. And somehow they've just gone negative beta. Every time markets fall, somehow there is a lot of strength in the auto space. Fundamentally, people talk about input prices and the impact that could have on the entire basket of stocks. But as a technician, I see a lot of relative strength, because when you divide the auto index by the Nifty, you get a sense that this is one of the few sectors in the market which is in an uptrend. So I think this is going to continue. And the three or four stocks that I mentioned, I would focus there. I would not go to the other side.Source: ET Now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/these-3-stocks-can-propel-the-auto-index-to-new-lifetime-highs/articleshow/97915675.cms

The stock market has taken Budget 2023 very positively and showing good numbers with the market going up. An ET Now report suggests that a mix of positive and negative responses on the budget came from market experts. As far as Mahindra & Mahindra Finance is concerned, experts said that the stock has been doing well for the last few days. And now it’s shaping up for a longer-term breakout. After being an underperformer for a long time, It has become an outperformer for few months. The stock is expected to rise from Rs 260 to Rs 280 in the short term and much higher in the medium term. Though markets have reacted favorably to the budget. According to some experts, the budget is neutral as there was no mention of capital gains tax or Securities Transaction Tax (STT) in it. ICICI bank is something that is popping up quite strongly. According to experts with this kind of boost, ICICI may return to its leadership quality. They term this as the standout feature in the market. ICICI Bank is expected to set a target of Rs 920 and a stop loss of Rs 820. As a variety of reactions to this budget are received, some believe it is exceptional and optimistic. Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, shared his view with ET Now. He believes that it is the best time to put money on both Nifty & Bank Nifty. “All this pessimism on profit-taking is because of the Fed and the pivot. You could not have asked for more. Let us not be greedy. We were just asking for small mercies but got everything on a platter, as far as capital gains and spending for the middle class are concerned. The last Budget was for the high-end with PLI. We had food insurance for the lower end. This time’s budget is all about MSMEs. MSME means banking growth and consumption, and we have got relief for all types of tax brackets and could not have asked for more. There’s capex push with Rs 7.5 lakh crore becoming Rs 10 lakh crore. The markets are going to take a day or so. Next week onwards, 18,500 is on the cards.” he said.Source: ET Now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-do-share-market-experts-rate-the-budget/articleshow/97527766.cms

He lost his job, so in January 2008 he wanted to sell the flat to Mubarak Vahid Patel. Patel applied to Citicorp Finance for a loan. A tripartite agreement was executed and registered on 12 February, 2008, in which Citicorp agreed to sanction a loan of Rs 32 lakh towards the total sale consideration. The agreement provided that Citicorp would pay a part of the loan amount directly to ICICI Bank to clear the loan, and the balance amount would be paid to Nanda for sale of the flat to Patel. Citicorp Finance partially disbursed the loan to clear ICICI Bank's dues of Rs 17.8 lakh. However, the balance consideration for the flat was not paid to Nanda. After exhausting all remedies to get the balance amount, Nanda finally filed a consumer complaint in 2018. The complaint was initially dismissed by the National Commission, and so was the Review Petition. Nanda challenged the orders in the Supreme Court which remanded the matter for being decided after hearing all the parties. Citicorp defended itself by denying the existence of any tripartite agreement. The National Commission observed that in the absence of a tripartite agreement, Citicorp would not have disbursed part of the loan amount to clear ICICI Bank's dues. It also noted that Citicorp had asked for an NOC from the housing society for disbursing the remaining loan amount. So it refused to believe Citicorp's defence. The Commission castigated Citicorp for making Nanda run around for several years to get his rightful claim of the balance sale consideration of Rs.13.2 lakh. By its order of 19 January, 2023 delivered by Inder Jit Singh for the Bench along with Justice Ram Surat Ram Maurya, the National Commission ordered Citicorp to pay Rs 13.2 lakh to Nanda along with 12% interest from 14 April, 2008 onward. It also awarded Rs 1 lakh as litigation costs.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/financer-held-liable-for-failure-to-disburse-agreed-upon-loan-amount/articleshow/97428749.cms

Several top officials at b,"Mumbai: Stock prices of most major banks, along with that of insurance giant LIC, witnessed sharp selling on Friday as marketmen feared about their exposure to the Adani Group’s pile of debt. Although several top officials at banks and with Adani Group went public about limited exposure compared to lending books and total assets, most of these stocks closed deep in the red.Consider this: SBI, the largest lender in India, closed 5% lower at Rs 540, while LIC lost 3.5% to Rs 666. SBI has advanced loans to Adani Group entities for their airport and other infrastructure ventures, while LIC has invested over Rs 20,000 crore in Adani Group’s stocks.According to Geojit Financial Services head (research) Vinod Nair, the sharp slump in the market was triggered by an unfavourable research report on Asia’s richest promoter’s group companies. “This is also affecting the banking stocks even though the results of the sector are optimistic,” he said. The selloff in bank stocks was due to their lending to Adani Group companies, indicating potential risk, Nair said. “PSU banks are the most impacted compared to private banks owing to high exposure.”Among private banks that saw substantial loss in stock price were ICICI Bank, down 4.4%, IndusInd Bank, down 3.4% and Axis bank, down 2.1%.

Here is a peak into which banks are doing well and what the commentary of major banks are indicating. They arrived at a time when provisions were at a multi-quarter low; in fact, they were ebbing, and you could see that NPAs were also at their lowest point.According to reports, strong, well-capitalized banks are reporting higher earnings, including increase in NII (Net Interest Income), profitability, and now even growth. As a result, these factors are working well together. Deposits are currently the main topic of attention because of the pick-up and advances.Deposits is probably the most important metric to track in this particular quarter. Here are the details of the top private sector banks.When HDFC first released its results last week, it reported a 20% growth in both advances and deposits. When the system deposit growth is struggling to reach double digits, HDFC bank has surpassed the 20% mark. In the case of ICICI Bank, loan growth is 20%, which is certainly healthy; however, deposit growth is not keeping pace with loan growth; in fact, ICICI Bank's deposit growth is only 10%.Kotak Bank, on the other hand, saw a 24% increase in loan growth. The deposit growth rate is only 13%. It lagged by 10% or more on loans versus deposits, but Kotak Bank has done quite well in comparison.When IndusInd Bank is considered, the bank has seen 19% growth in advances and a 14% growth in deposits.So clearly, across all banks, there is advanced growth, but very low deposit growth, except for two banks: HDFC Bank and Bandhan Bank. In both of these banks, deposit growth has been greater than loan growth, which is a unique feature in this quarter for these banks.HDFC bank said loan growth is absolutely robust. In fact, the bank did not participate in wholesale loans worth Rs 30 to 40 thousand crores, and they expanded their branch network by 684 branches in Q3. Over the last few quarters, Kotak Bank has seen irrational pricing, particularly for lending to companies and a few corporates selectively. They are seeing strong loan growth, particularly in unsecured MFI Agri SME loans, and they expect strong margins to normalize at these levels, as well as a shift from savings to TD(term deposit), which is already happening.About valuations that's the last piece it appears that the price-to-book value for HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank and IndusInd Bank are 3.2, 3, 3.3 and 1.8 respectively. Clearly, it appears that IndusInd Bank has a lower price-to-book value compared to HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Kotak BankSource: ET Now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-banking-growth-stacks-up-q3-fy23/articleshow/97260016.cms

How are other banks going to perform in Q3? Market expert Rahul Malani shares his analysis with ET Now. Overall, ICICI Bank's financial performance appears to be favorable, as they reported results that exceeded expectations. The beat was primarily due to an expansion in net interest margin security(NIMS). The bank has also scaled up its contingent provisions, which is a positive sign. However, deposit mobilization has moderated both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. This means that deposit mobilization and operating leverage will be key areas to watch, as the bank's strong performance in recent years will not guarantee growth in the coming quarters.Which banks are likely to have large stock market gains in the near future? In the last few years, we have seen ICICI bank perform well in terms of private banks. So in the next two years cycles, we believe that HDFC bank and Kotak bank will be the next big banks. Kotak bank will outperform. The HDFC bank would almost certainly be re-rated as well. Additionally, the earnings trajectory has remained somewhat consistent in Kotak Bank as well. Stock prices will outperform because they both underperformed in the previous two to three years. ICICI Bank is therefore likely to deliver market returns; however, additional outperformance is not anticipated. The same is true for PSU banks. Top-tier PSUs will produce market returns, but lower-tier PSU banks like Bank of India and Punjab National Bank will perform better.

A bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Prithviraj Chavan held that the ""grounds of arrest are quite casual and without substance"" and also found the special court ""casual"" in ordering remand.97186107Dhoot, 72, left the Arthur Road jail in an ambulance in the evening after almost four weeks behind bars. His family planned to take him home to Aurangabad by an air ambulance. Dhoot cannot leave the country without prior court nod, the HC said, ordering cash bail of Rs 1 lakh with surety to be furnished within two weeks.On January 9, the same high court bench had held the arrest of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar, both co-accused with Dhoot, flouted laws and released them on bail. 97186111""Merely stating that he (Dhoot) was inconsistent cannot be a grounds for arrest as it is unacceptable and contrary"" to the mandate that a person cannot be compelled to give self-incriminating statements under constitutional rights, the court added.HC points out CBI's 'falsity' over Dhoot non-appearanceThe law requires the agency officer to record satisfaction for an arrest, said the Bombay HC, while granting bail to Videocon promoter Venugopal Dhoot in the ICICI Bank loan fraud case. There is nothing on record demonstrating that the officer had a ""reason to believe"" and ""satisfaction for an arrest"", it said.The HC also said ""no serious efforts"" were made by the special court in its remand order to scrutinise the CBI's remand plea and case diary. ""The onus of recording satisfaction, as already stated, not only lies on the investigating officer but even on the remanding judge,"" held the HC.Separately, the HC on Friday passed an order rejecting an intervention application filed by lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay to oppose Dhoot's plea for interim relief and imposed ""exemplary costs"" of Rs 25,000 on him.The CBI had arrested Dhoot when he showed up at its office in Mumbai on December 26 in response to a notice. The central agency had already arrested the Kochhars on December 23.On the day the Kochhars got bail, Dhoot approached the HC through counsel Sandeep Ladda and sought release alleging his arrest and remand were ""arbitrary, illegal'' and violated the provisions governing arrest as well as his constitutional rights. He also sought quashing of the FIR, which will be heard next month.Ladda pointed out Dhoot had attended the CBI office in New Delhi on December 21 and 22. He was again summoned on December 23, but since the Enforcement Directorate had already summoned him that day, he could not and informed the CBI.On December 24, the CBI issued Dhoot another notice under section 41A of CrPC, issued when arrest is not required, to come and explain the next day. Dhoot emailed the CBI, which sent him another notice on December 25. He appeared on December 26, said Ladda, and was arrested. Dhoot had been cooperating from the start, said Ladda, refuting the CBI's claims saying they lacked particulars.The CBI, through senior counsel Raja Thakare and advocate Kuldeep Patil, argued that Dhoot's arrest was justified as he was not cooperating, gave inconsistent and evasive answers and not the ""full and true"" picture. They said his arrest was needed to confront him with the Kochhars.""The grounds of arrest given by CBI is sans any particulars as to how his (Dhoot's) statements are inconsistent and how he had not co-operated with the investigating agency in view of the fact that he had already attended the office...,"" the high court said on Friday. Instead, its order noted, ""from the language of the e-mail, it appears the petitioner had handed over all the documents and had co-operated with the investigating agency... despite his deteriorating health"".The HC said the ""CBI made a futile attempt to justify the arrest'' and pointed to ""falsity"" of the CBI statement that Dhoot ""deliberately did not appear"" to avoid confrontation with the Kochhars on December 23.Upadhyay has been asked to deposit the penalty amount with the state legal services authority.

ICICI,2023-01-13T13:45:00+05:30,PTI,ICICI case: Videocon's Dhoot says his arrest was unnecessary; CBI says he was evading probe,"India Business News: Dhoot, arrested by the CBI on December 26, 2022, and presently in judicial custody, has moved the high court seeking to quash the First Information Re","MUMBAI: The lawyer of Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot on Friday argued before the Bombay High Court that the industrialist's arrest in the ICICI Bank loan fraud case was unwarranted as he was cooperating with the probe. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), on the other hand, claimed that he was trying to avoid probe. Dhoot, arrested by the CBI on December 26, 2022, and presently in judicial custody, has moved the high court seeking to quash the First Information Report, and has also sought interim bail. A division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and P K Chavan after hearing both Dhoot's lawyer Sandeep Laddha and CBI's counsel Raja Thakare reserved its order on interim relief. Advocate Laddha argued that Dhoot had appeared before the CBI ""31 times"" since a 'preliminary enquiry' (PE) was registered in December 2017. ""Dhoot was never arrested in the case. Even when the charge sheet was filed, Dhoot had appeared before the concerned court which granted him bail noting that he had been co-operating with the probe,"" the lawyer said. Dhoot had appeared before the CBI twice even last month, he said. On two other dates (December 23 and 25) he could not appear as on December 23 he had been already summoned by the Enforcement Directorate, the lawyer said. ""The CBI is holding this non-appearance for two days as non-co-operation. On December 25, the CBI issued Dhoot a notice....he appeared on December 26 and was arrested,"" advocate Laddha said. CBI counsel Raja Thakare said Dhoot was summoned in December 2022 so as to confront him with co-accused Chanda Kochhar, former MD and CEO of ICICI Bank; and her husband Deepak Kochhar, both of whom were arrested on December 23. ""There has been a systematic attempt by Dhoot and the Kochhars to avoid probe. It is a case of conspiracy. When they are outside (not arrested) they decide the precise answers to give. But the moment one person is arrested, the blame game starts and they start pointing fingers at each other,"" Thakare said. He added that the CBI wanted to bring the three accused together for interrogation. ""Despite being summoned, he (Dhoot) refused to appear. The CBI at the time had Kochhars' custody for a brief time and hence wanted to confront them with Dhoot,"" Thakare said. When the HC asked if after Dhoot's arrest the three were interrogated together, Thakare said they were questioned together on December 26 and 27. But Dhoot's lawyer said this was not true. The industrialist was never made to sit with the Kochhars and questioned after his arrest, he claimed. Thakare further said that just because there was a delay in arresting an accused, the arrest does not become illegal or unwarranted. ""These cases are of high magnitude with high value transactions woven in layers of companies which are difficult to probe. A meticulous study is required,"" he said. If a person is hurriedly arrested then the clock starts ticking for the investigating agency to conduct the investigation within the time stipulated for the filing of charge sheet, the CBI lawyer said. The high court bench had on Monday granted interim bail to Chanda Kochhar and Deepak Kochhar in the case while coming down heavily on the CBI for arresting them in a ""casual and mechanical"" manner. As per the Central agency, private sector lender ICICI Bank had sanctioned credit facilities of Rs 3,250 crore to Videocon Group companies in violation of the Banking Regulation Act, Reserve Bank of India's guidelines and the credit policy of the bank. The CBI has named Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot along with Nupower Renewables (NRL) managed by Deepak Kochhar, Supreme Energy, Videocon International Electronics Ltd and Videocon Industries Ltd as accused in the FIR registered in 2019 under Indian Penal Code sections related to criminal conspiracy and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. As part of 'quid pro quo' (something given in return for favour) for the loans sanctioned to Videocon Group firms, Dhoot invested Rs 64 crore in Nupower Renewables through Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd (SEPL), and transferred SEPL to Pinnacle Energy Trust managed by Deepak Kochhar through a circuitous route between 2010 and 2012, the CBI alleged.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-case-videocons-dhoot-says-his-arrest-was-unnecessary-cbi-says-he-was-evading-probe/articleshow/96961888.cms

Nupower was operated by Deepak Kochhar.Asking Sebi to provide documents, the tribunal said that it was obligatory for the markets regulator to supply all the minutes of the Sanctioning Committee meetings in respect of loan sanctioned to Videocon Group instead of partially supplying the minutes of those meetings where Kochhar was present.SAT noted that documents sought by Kochhar were only supplied in part -- the minutes of the Sanctioning Committee in which Kochhar participated were provided to her and the other minutes have been denied only on the ground that she was not a participant in those meetings.""The distinction made by the respondent for not supplying the documents is not only absurd but perverse,"" the tribunal said in its order passed on January 5.However, the appellate tribunal said that documents such as list of 33 officials of ICICI Bank who were interviewed as well as the recording of their statements and correspondence between the bank and the CBI cannot be supplied.These documents cannot be provided as they are not available with the ICICI Bank and were not part of the report provided to the bank by retired Justice B N Srikrishna.Sebi counsel stated that the correspondence between the bank and the CBI are not part of the report and cannot be provided. ""Such a request amounts to a roving and fishing enquiry which cannot be entertained"".The regulator, in May 2018, issued a show cause notice to her raising allegations of conflict of interest in respect of approvals of loans or credit facilities by the ICICI Bank to the Videocon Group.Kochhar submitted a detailed response to the show cause notice in August 2018 and personal hearing was held in November 2018 and thereafter, she submitted its written submissions in December 2018 and the matter thereafter was reserved for orders.Later in November 2020, an amended show cause notice was issued to her on the basis of the Srikrishna committee report.It was alleged that the amended show cause notice was incomplete as it was not accompanied by any enclosures or annexures or exhibits or appendices.

While Chanda Kochhar is lodged in Byculla jail, her husband and Dhoot are in Arthur Road prison. The Kochhars were arrested on December 24, while Dhoot was arrested two days later. While in CBI custody, the court had allowed their respective pleas for home food. Chanda Kochhar's lawyer had then told the court that over the last few years, she has been suffering from severe vertigo which requires close and constant medical attention, as also daily medicines and supplements. It was submitted that she was suffering from high cholesterol and has low hemoglobin, susceptible to various cardiovascular diseases and had been advised to remain in a clean and hygienic environment and always eat home-cooked food with minimal oil and spices.

The increase in earnings was driven by an improvement in interest margins coupled with a growth in business banking loans.The board recommended a dividend of eight rupees per share, subject to shareholder approval.The bank’s net interest income rose 40.2% to Rs 17,667 crore, widening the net interest margin to 4.9% from 4%. Announcing the results, Sandeep Batra, executive director of ICICI Bank, said that the interest margins improve with rising rates as deposit rates are largely fixed and get repriced on maturity while most loans are on floating rates.In the results call, Batra refuted a report by an online portal that the bank faced a data breach. “This is a totally baseless, mischievous and false claim. We have asked, but they have not been able to provide any evidence of their claim of 3.6 million records. They could show some four URL records – one of the mails sent by an ICICI Bank employee to a customer; this URL stack does not belong to the bank,” said Batra. Batra said that the bank was also able to manage with an advances growth of 18.7% versus a deposit growth of 10.9% as the lender had surplus liquidity of Rs 50,000 crore at the beginning of the year and another Rs 5,000 crore in the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund which was used for credit. The bank’s loan book stood at Rs 1019638 crore, while deposits stood at Rs 1180841 crore as of March 2023.The business banking portfolio grew 34.9% year-on-year and 7.8% sequentially on March 31, 2023. The SME business, comprising borrowers with a turnover of less than Rs 250 crore, grew 19.2% year-on-year and 6.2% sequentially on March 31, 2023. The bank has a business banking book of Rs 72,000 crore and an SME portfolio of Rs 48,000 crore.“There has been a significant formalisation of small businesses following the introduction of GST, and our ability to assess credit in this segment has increased,” said Batra. He added that the bank had not seen any impact of the increase in the interest rate on demand for home loans.The bank reported improved asset quality, with its gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio falling to 2.81% from 3.60% a year earlier.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-net-profit-rises-to-record-rs-9122-crore-in-q4fy23/articleshow/99692274.cms

In order to secure the loan, the bank had compelled him to take an insurance","Late Dharambir Saini had taken a home loan of Rs 75 lakh from ICICI Bank. In order to secure the loan, the bank had compelled him to take an insurance policy from ICICI Lombard General Insurance so that in case of any mishap, the insurer would be liable to repay the loan amount. The policy was valid from October 15 , 2013 to October 14, 2018, but no document was given to Dharambir regarding the insurance coverage.On October 20, 2015, Dharambir was hospitalized, and he expired on October 25, 2015 due to septic shock with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). His widow Neema Saini intimated the insurer and lodged a claim along with the supporting documents. The insurer rejected the claim on March 7, 2016 on the ground that the claim was not covered under the terms of the policy.Neema made futile pleas to ICICI Bank to resolve the issue. So she filed a complaint before the Delhi State Commission for a direction to clear the loan from to settle the claim.The insurer contested the case. It argued that Seema was not entitled to file the complaint. It also alleged that crucial medical history of diabetes and tuberculosis had not been disclosed in the proposal form. It stated that the policy was delivered to the insured under a covering letter dated October 16, 2013, and the insured was aware that the claim was not payable. The State Commission observed that Neema was the nominee under the policy, and so she was entitled to file the complaint. On merits, the State Commission held that the pre-existing ailments had no bearing on the cause of death, and so the claim would be payable. It noted that the main issue was whether the policy had been provided to the insured so as to make him aware of the terms and conditions governing the policy, and observed that the insurer had merely filed a copy of the covering letter, but had failed to produce any evidence to substantiate that it had been delivered to the insured. So it concluded that the entire coverage amount of Rs 75 lakh would have to be paid along with 9% interest, Rs 3 lakh towards compensation, and Rs.50,000/- the litigation costs.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/insurer-cant-refuse-payout-when-policy-papers-not-handed-over/articleshow/96670560.cms

The HC vacation bench said there was “no urgency” after their lawyer said the plea was for quashing of the remand order.

However, taking loans to aggressively expand the business proved to be his d","Former ICICI Bank chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar had ended up generating headlines over what the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) alleged was a quid pro quo deal with Videocon, but the company’s promoter and chairman Venugopal Dhoot managed to maintain a low profile.That was until December 26, when the CBI arrested the head of what was once among India’s largest conglomerates with interests in consumer durables, entertainment, power and energy.The trigger for 71-year-old Dhoot’s arrest was a complaint by the investigating authorities that the industrialist invested money in the business of Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar to get out-of-turn loans.In recent years, barring insolvency proceedings, Dhoot managed to stay below the radar. Not many would remember that Videocon was one of the largest colour picture tube manufacturers in the world and the largest consumer durables company in the country, giving Samsung and LG a run for their money. medium96537725Videocon Group was founded by Nandlal Madhavlal Dhoot in 1984 in Aurangabad. The senior Dhoot originally ran a sugar mill, and the family also had a Bajaj Auto dealership in Aurangabad. Nandlal was into sugarcane and cotton cultivation. The family then established Adhigam Trading to sell paper tubes, which later forayed into consumer electronics.While the senior Dhoot enlisted all his sons — Venugopal, Rajkumar and Pradipkumar — in the family business, it was Venugopal who was responsible for scaling up Videocon’s operations following a technical tie-up with Toshiba.Younger brother Rajkumar played statesman, getting elected to the Rajya Sabha for two terms on a Shiv Sena ticket and taking charge as president of industry body Assocham. But Venugopal was the main driver of the group, entering into manufacturing partnerships and acquiring foreign players.As economic reforms led to a consumer boom, Dhoot scaled up operations through a series of acquisitions, including that of the Philips colour television plant in 1999. In 2005, Videocon took over the colour television tube manufacturing business of global giant Thomson and, within weeks, acquired Electrolux Kelvinator. The group also signed a deal to acquire South Korea’s debt-burdened Daewoo Electronics, taking the fight to the home market of the Koreans. medium96537769The inflection point for the group came when it started diversifying outside its core area of consumer durables. When the government began selling oil exploration blocks, Videocon was one of the few groups with the balance sheet strength to bid for large projects. The group invested in oil & gas fields in Brazil, Indonesia, Mozambique among other parts of the world.When the government started issuing telecom licences under the first-come-first-served policy in 2008, Videocon was one of the successful applicants. It even drew adverse observations from the Comptroller and Auditor General for “jumping the queue”. Trouble started for the group when the controversy erupted over 2G licences and the Supreme Court cancelled the allocations.For the group, this was a big hit as it had invested several thousand crores in the business. At the same time, the oil & gas business in Brazil got stuck after a change of government there.Besides manufacturing capabilities, Dhoot also came under the limelight for his association with Bollywood, hiring celebrities as brand ambassadors and setting up direct-to-home service provider Videocon D2H. He had also sought to acquire an Indian Premier League team.The inability to service debt led to the company being downgraded and, finally, being declared a non-performing asset. With admitted claims of Rs 71,500 crore, Videocon was part of the companies that the Reserve Bank of India referred to banks to initiate insolvency proceedings. medium96537647How Chanda Kochhar's arrest made banks risk-averse medium96537666",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-videocons-dhoot-went-from-biz-empire-to-jail-cell/articleshow/96537503.cms

CBI prosecutor A Limosin said, “CBI arrested accused number 3, Dhoot, at 10.30am. The case is causing wrongful loss of Rs 1,730 crore to ICICI Bank between 2009 and 2011.” He said, “Chanda Kochhar (accused number 4) was MD of ICICI Bank in 2009 and six loans were sanctioned by her when she was its CEO. The beneficiaries were Dhoot and his Videocon group. He was evading notices issued to him. He appeared today. He was arrested.” Limosin said, “Second case, a flat coating over Rs 5 crore in 2016 was sold for Rs 11 lakh by Dhoot. So we require three days’ custody of the Kochhars and Dhoot to confront them in custody as part of the probe.”The CBI had alleged a “quid pro quo in loan arrangement” between ICICI Bank and the Videocon group as Rs 64 crore was allegedly sent to Deepak Kochhar’s company. Its remand plea said Dhoot has “changed his version on several occasions…and not disclosed full and true facts.” Senior counsel Vikram Chaudhri for Deepak Kochhar, along with senior counsel Amit Desai for Chanda Kochhar and Somnath Ladda for Dhoot questioned their arrest and said it was in violation of rules governing power of arrest and landmark apex court rulings to prevent misuse of such arrest power. Somnath Ladda argued that in the same offence, considering Dhoot’s cooperation, ED never arrested Dhoot and PMLA court also released him on bail. He said this was proof of Dhoot’s cooperation. He added Videocon took loans not just from ICICI Bank, but a consortium of 26 banks “so there cannot be any quid pro quo.” Chaudhri said, “CBI maintains an eerie silence for four years. And arrest only when his (Kochhar’s) only son’s marriage is fixed for January 15, 2023.” “Why this inhuman act,” he asked. “Now they (CBI) say they intend to clamp Section 409 of IPC.” He questioned how CBI could have invoked an offence under PC Act, which in 2018 when the Act was amended, was no longer an offence. He said no prior sanction was taken from the bank as mandated under the PC Act before investigating the Kochhars.Desai reiterated lack of prior sanction under Section 17 A of PC Act before conducting any inquiry against a public servant. He also said on July 9, 2021, the bank had written to CBI saying “no wrongful loss was caused” to it. Desai said the letter “purporting to be a Section 17 A approval’’ should be produced in court by CBI. A written plea for its production, later filed, will be heard by the court on Tuesday.It was Deepak Kochhar’s 2nd arrest—in September 2020 ED had arrested him in a money laundering case it lodged in 2019 following the January 22, 2019 FIR lodged by CBI. Somnath Ladda and his son Sandeep said Dhoot’s company was “under process to recover the Rs 64 crore it invested in Deepak Kochhar’s company.” “Let CBI show prima facie it is a bribe,” said Somnath Ladda. He denied non-cooperation by Dhoot. He added, “In spite of deteriorating health (Dhoot) has always cooperated.” CBI justified the arrest citing “non-cooperation.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/have-always-cooperated-says-dhoot-cbi-claims-hes-changing-his-stance/articleshow/96531627.cms

Last week, the CBI had arrested former CEO of ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar in relation to the same case.The CBI alleged a quid pro co deal wherein ICICI bank granted Rs 1,875 crore loan to Videocon Group, while Dhoot paid Rs 64 crore as kickbacks. CBI alleged that this Rs 64 crore was shown as investment in Deepak's company.After Chanda Kochhar took charge as CEO of ICICI Bank, between June 2009 and October 2011, the bank sanctioned Rs 1,875 crore loans to six companies of Videocon Group. Chanda Kochhar was one of the committee members in the two loans, including the Rs 300 crore loan to Videocon International Electronics Limited (VIEL). The very next day of this loan being disbursed, Dhoot had transferred Rs 64 crore to NuPower Renewable Limited, a company held by Deepak Kochhar. However, Videocon Group defaulted the loan payment causing loss to the bank.The probe agency said that Chanda Kochhar committed criminal breach of trust by sanctioning Rs 300 crore loan and later on converted the funds of Rs 64 crore for her own use (by investment in her husband company NuPower Renewable Limited). It further added that being a public servant, she was entrusted with the bank funds for which she was liable to discharge such trust in accordance with the guidelines issued by the ICICI Bank.The CBI also alleged that Dhoot transferred an apartment to Kochhar’s for their favour. In 1996, the apartment at CCI Chambers in South Mumbai was purchased for Rs 5.2 crore in the name of Credential Finance Ltd in which Videocon group had substantial shares along with Chanda and Deepak Kochhar. Credential Finance defaulted on a Rs 4.7 crore loan of SBI Home Finance for which the apartment was placed at security. In 2009, Videocon Group paid the SBI dues and transferred the ownership of the apartment to its group company-- Quality Appliances Pvt Ltd.

Banks became more careful, but also maybe excessively ","Like all disgraced stars of Mumbai’s money market, Chanda Kochhar, the former CEO of ICICI Bank, and her husband Deepak, a businessman, had been leading a quiet life for the past few years. The alleged ‘loan for favours’ scandal, which broke in 2018, ruined her career and put Deepak behind bars for some time. But it had begun to blow over after the Kochhars got a relief from ED in 2020. Amid the pandemic and slowdown, most took their eyes off a story that had brought out a banker-corporate nexus that till then was confined to whispers in corporate dinners. When a 2016 whistleblower complaint later spilled out the brazen deals and transaction trails, there was very little left to the imagination: As the CEO and MD of ICICI Bank, Chanda had allegedly played a key role in sanctioning large loans to Videocon group companies while Dhoots, the owners of Videocon, invested (sometimes almost immediately) in Deepak Kochhar’s business. For the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) it was a classic case of quid pro quo. That was the summer of 2018. But even colourful stories have a shelf life. CBI stayed silent for a long time – was it due to the pandemic? ED’s provisional attachment on Kochhar’s south Mumbai apartment was lifted in November 2020 when the property was not considered as ‘proceeds of crime’ under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). medium nocaption96499267 Everyone felt the story had run its course – probably, even the Kochhars, who began preparations for a grand destination wedding for their son in 2023. On January 14, a chartered flight from Mumbai was scheduled to carry several industrialists and friends of the Kochhars to the wedding in Jaisalmer. But now the celebrations may have to wait. On Friday evening the Kochhars were arrested by CBI Delhi in the same case that everyone believed had gone cold. It is a widely shared perception that high-profile arrests rarely happen without a green signal from the bosses. So, obvious questions have cropped up: What took the CBI so long? After all, it is over a year that the board of ICICI, as per the law, had given CBI the ‘sanction to prosecute’ its former CEO. Has the agency stumbled upon new evidence? What could these be? Is there a canary who finally chose to sing? Did the new CBI director feel why not take another look at the case? Or could Kochhars know something and eventually spill the beans on someone? As the head of a large and one of the most aggressive banks, Chanda, who was arrested for the first time, is still a repository of sensitive information, knowing many things about many people. While few outside SoBo (south Bombay, to those unfamiliar with the term) social circles knew about Deepak or his business activities before the couple hit the headlines for wrong reasons, Chanda – a protegee of KV Kamath and the first woman CEO of India’s largest private sector bank from 2009 to 2016 – was once the toast of India Inc. More than a decade has passed since the loan and investment deals involving ICICI, Videocon and Deepak Kochhar happened. For a government keen to demonstrate a clean break from the profligacies of the past, persons like Chanda and Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor are the deeply flawed icons of a debt-fuelled era when high-street banks opened their doors to undeserving borrowers. Neither the powers nor the people sympathise with them. So, what has changed since then? While RBI didn’t act on the findings of the whistleblower, the regulator, under Raghuram Rajan (2013-16), changed the rules to force banks to set aside extra capital for weak loans. It was the first blow to the nexus between banks and business houses. Since then, boards, loaded with extra responsibilities, have become more careful, independent directors are a frightened lot who take their job more seriously, and a banker is saddled with compliance like never before. Indeed, tighter rules have swung the pendulum to the other end. For instance, using a loan for different business needs than what it was originally meant for could be construed as fund diversion even if the money is not siphoned out by the borrower. Bankers have sent feelers to the government to bring about a change in the criminal law to stop arbitrary arrests by state police based on FIRs and complaints filed by aggrieved, and often dodgy, borrowers. Banks are supposed to ‘run risk’, and not ‘avoid risk’. A banker today would think twice before striking blatant quid pro quo deals, but there are other pitfalls. Even as large banks, particularly state-owned lenders, shy away from normal risks and lose business to institutions like mutual funds, they may be ending up giving out lumpy loans to bankroll some of the already over-leveraged corporate groups who have emerged as the new flavours. For CBI, blessed by a short public memory, the Kochhars could go down as an isolated case ending in conviction; or, simply another event marked by a few weeks of headlines, innuendoes, controlled media leaks and breathless commentaries by moralising television anchors. We all know how it works out.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-kosher-post-kochhar/articleshow/96499207.cms

Kochhar, was finally arrested along with her husband Deepak Kochhar.It is some seven years after the first of the complaints surfaced that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) bit the bullet to nab the Kochhar couple in connection with the alleged massive Rs 3,250 crore loan fraud involving the defunct Videocon Group.Among other things, the CBI has accused Chanda Kochhar, 61, of irregularities, flouting banking rules and laws in a series of loans sanctioned to industrialist Venugopal N. Dhoot's Videocon Group between 2009-2011, when she was lording over the bank.The CBI earlier in 2019 booked the Kochhar couple and Dhoot, besides naming the companies like Videocon International Electronics Ltd., NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd., Videocon Industries Ltd., Supreme Energy Pvt. Ltd., under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act.In an alleged quid pro quo deal, the CBI claimed that after the Videocon Group got the loan of Rs 3,250 crore from ICICI Bank in 2012, Dhoot reportedly diverted a Rs 64 crore to NuPower Renewables where Deepak Kochhar had a 50 per cent stake, raising eyebrows and questions on ethics, as Chanda had set the credit limits for the Videocon Group companies.The CBI charge sheet said that under Kochhar, the ICICI Bank sanctioned the loans to Videocon Group and others in complete violation of the bank's policies, and later these were declared non performing assets (NPAs) causing losses to the bank and illegal gains to the borrowers and accused.The CBI also wanted to investigate the role of other ICICI Bank's senior officers who approved the loans to Videocon Group, among others, allegedly at Chanda's behest.The loans to Videocon Group companies and others eventually turned into NPAs by 2017, and the CBI said that most were grossly flouting the laws, banking rules and the bank's regulations, and were red-flagged as 'frauds' after the probe.Independent banking circles say that the ICICI Bank reported the maximum NPAs during Chanda's leadership and as per a RTI reply received by a Pune businessman Prafful Sarda, it had accumulated up to a staggering around Rs 200,000 crore till 2021.Just last week, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed parliament that among other banks, the ICICI Bank had written off loans worth Rs 42,164 crore.As the heat was turned on, in early-2018 Chanda went on leave and then applied for early retirement, which the ICICI Bank accepted, ostensibly as it was kept in the dark on certain facts and non-disclosures on various issues, which came up later.Rattled by the complaints and media exposures, the ICICI Bank appointed a committee headed by retired Supreme Court judge, Justice B. N. Srikrishna in June 2018 to probe all the allegations against Chanda from April 2009-March 2018.The report damned her for ineffectively dealing with 'conflict of interest' and 'due disclosure or recusal' requirements, violating ICICI Bank's Code of Conduct, lack of 'diligence' with respect to annual disclosures as required by the bank,After this report, the ICICI Bank decided to treat Chanda's separation as 'Termination for Cause' with severe consequences including revocation of all her existing and future entitlements like unpaid amounts, bonuses, increments, unvested and vested and unexercised stock options, medical benefits and clawback of all bonuses paid to her during the probe period and take any further actions as warranted.Shaken by the turn of events, Chanda not only questioned Justice Srikrishna's report but also challenged her termination by the ICICI Bank in the Bombay High Court and later Supreme Court, only to face disappointment.These developments drew the curtains on the Jodhpur-born and Mumbai educated bright babe of Indian banking falling into disgrace - all within 16 years - from 1984 when she joined the ICICI Bank as a trainee and became the Executive Director in 2001.From there on, she spread her wings and soared up the ladder quickly, to become the all-powerful MD & CEO in 2009, after which the apparent downhill slide started for her and the bank.Over the years, awed by her perceived calibre and skills, Chanda picked up a string of many national and international awards or honours, was conferred the Padma Bhushan, advised the government on policy issues and was a much-sought after speaker at domestic and global events.Chanda's arrest by the CBI marks yet another grisly end to what could have been a glorious banking career, ranks among several of the high-profile banking scams arising out of the lure of lucre that have rocked the Indian banking industry and she counts among a handful of shining top women bankers to crash under an eclipse of ignominy...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/chanda-kochhar-from-kamaths-angel-to-jail/articleshow/96493188.cms

After arresting the two in Delhi following their questioning in the case on Friday, the CBI produced the duo in the special court seeking three days' custody, which was granted. The CBI accused them of non-cooperation in the investigation.Chanda Kochhar took charge of the ICICI Bank as its managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) in May 2009, after which she allegedly illegally sanctioned loans to the Videocon group of companies. The ICICI Bank loans of Rs 1,875 crore to the Videocon group companies became non-performing assets (NPA) in 2017. It caused loss to the bank, according to the CBI. However, her lawyer told the court that there was no wrongful loss to the bank and the entire loan amount was repaid. The lawyer also said that the CBI had not taken mandatory sanction under Section 17 A of the Prevention of Corruption Act to investigate her and that she should be released. Under the section, it's a mandatory requirement for police to seek previous approval for conducting any investigation into any offence committed by a public servant. The CBI countered the argument stating that they had sanction under the Section 19 of the act to investigate Chanda Kochhar.According to the CBI case, Chanda Kochhar received Rs 64 crore kickback in Deepak’s company, Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd, from the Videocon group in lieu of the loans. It is alleged that Rs 300 crore loan was disbursed to one of the companies of the Videocon group and within 48 hours of the disbursement, Rs 64 crore was transferred to Nupower Renewables through layers of transactions.Also, it is alleged that the Kochhar family purchased a flat from the Videocon group at a nominal rate.

Foreign funds were relatively quiet with their selling with a net outflow figure at Rs 707 crore, while domestic funds, despite being big buyers at a net inflow of almost Rs 3,400 crore, couldn't tame the market's slide.According to Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities, there was frenzied selling on Dalal Street on Friday as weak global cues and bearish external factors pushed both the key benchmark indices below the psychological levels. ""Besides the spurt in Covid cases in China and Japan, the better-than-expected US third quarter GDP numbers further raised concerns that the US Fed will go for more rate hikes to tame inflation, which further accentuated selling pressure in the markets,"" Athawale said.While fears of a recession in the US and some other major markets resurfaced this week, nervousness about supply chain disruptions due to the huge outbreak of Covid in China pushed up crude oil prices. In the US market in mid-session on Friday, Brent and WTI crude prices were up about 3% each. In the past few months, as the global economy opened up and fears of a recession surfaced due to central banks' efforts to raise rates aggressively to tame inflation, crude prices had fallen over 30% from their multi-year high levels recorded in June this year.The day's selloff also left investors poorer by Rs 8.5 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 275.5 lakh crore, official data showed.Reliance Industries, Infosys and ICICI Bank led the slide among sensex stocks. However, the sell-off was more severe outside of the blue chips.

The rates have been increased across all tenors under the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) system, a move that will make EMI expensive for those who availed loans benchmarked against MCLR.

The one-year MCLR is considered important from a retail loans perspective, as a bank's long-term loans like home loans are linked to this rate. The rate hike comes ahead of the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting later this week. It is widely expected that the MPC would hike interest rates to tame high inflation.

The CBI alleged that Rs 64 crore was shown as investment in Deepak’s company.After Chanda took charge of ICICI Bank, it sanctioned Rs 1,875 crore in loans to six companies of Venugopal Dhoot’s Videocon group between June 2009 and October 2011. Chanda was one of the members of the committees that sanctioned two of those loans, including a Rs 300-crore loan to Videocon International Electronics Limited (VIEL). Just a day after this loan was disbursed, Dhoot transferred Rs 64 crore to NuPower Renewable Limited, Deepak’s company.The CBI alleged that Chanda had committed criminal breach of trust, which attracts a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The agency had questioned the couple at its office in Delhi on Friday and later, arrested them for non-cooperation. CBI’s special public prosecutor A Limosin moved a plea seeking addition of the charge of criminal breach of trust. The defence will submit its reply on Monday. 96485345The court said the offence is of a serious nature. The probe agency, in its remand application, said they wanted to interrogate the couple on the conspiracy leading to the sanction of loans to Videocon Group. It also said it wanted to probe the creation of a complex financial structure to conceal the quid pro quo of Rs 64 crore received by Chanda in her husband’s company account, as well as the transfer of a south Mumbai flat to the family trust of Deepak for Rs 11 lakh in 2016.During the hearing, the CBI alleged that Chanda had not cooperated in the probe, she was giving vague replies and denying knowledge about pecuniary transactions between her husband and Dhoot. The agency further submitted that she had not disclosed true and full facts pertaining to corruption allegations against her.The CBI had registered an FIR related to the allegations in 2019, and the defence raised questions about the Kochhars’ arrest three years later. The defence said the ED had already recorded her statement repeatedly, and even arrested Deepak. The lawyer questioned why, when the couple was not called all these years by the CBI, have they been arrested now. The lawyer also told the court that ICICI had replied to the CBI, stating that there had been no wrongful loss to the bank through the Videocon loans.The defence also cited the adjudicating authority of PMLA order that rejected the ED’s provisional attachment of the Kochhars’ property. The CBI expressed its surprise about the observation made by the adjudication authority of the PMLA in its order, by commenting on the cheating case registered by it.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-ex-chief-kochhar-husband-sent-to-cbi-custody/articleshow/96485342.cms

Two private lenders and one state-run bank have tapped the market to raise funds using these bonds in this period. Last week, the nation's largest lender State Bank of India raised $1.22 billion in the largest such issue. ""There is a revival in demand for infrastructure funds as economic activity picks up,"" said Ajay Manglunia, managing director and head of investment grade group at JM Financial. ""Hence banks that are focused on this sector are raising huge sums of money which would be deployed,"" Manglunia added. Infrastructure bonds are issued to finance long-term development projects.  Other banks that raised similar funds include ICICI Bank, which concluded a seven-year bond issue this week, and Kotak Mahindra Bank.  Several private lenders like Axis Bank and HDFC Bank are also planning infrastructure bonds in coming weeks, said merchant bankers, who spoke on condition of anonymity since their plans have yet to be firmed. Both the banks were not immediately available for comment.  ICICI Bank and Bank of Baroda have already tapped the market in August-September. ""Banks are trying to fund their credit growth, as economic activity is picking up, given the shape of their balance sheet and all this push for capex activity,"" said Pankaj Pathak, fund manager, fixed income at Quantum Mutual Fund.  ""If credit growth continues to remain healthy, it will lead to more bond issuances,"" Pathak added. The economy grew at 6.3% in July-September and is seen growing by 6.8% this financial year, with both private consumption and investment slowing amid rising inflation. Banks are also taking advantage of a recent dip in Indian government bond yield. While, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank paid an annual coupon of 7.63% each for their seven-year bonds, SBI paid 7.51% on its 10-year infra bonds.  The benchmark 10-year bond was trading at a semi-annual yield of 7.30%.

The first phase will begin with four banks: State Bank of India, ICICI Ba","The first pilot for the retail digital rupee (e₹-R) would commence on December 1, the Reserve Bank of India said on Wednesday. The pilot for the retail digital rupee comes a month after RBI commenced the first pilot in the wholesale segment (e₹-W) with the use case — ‘settlement of secondary market transactions in government securities’.  The CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) initiatives are expected to bring further efficiencies in payment processing and settlements. What is CBDC? “CBDC is the legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form. It is the same as a fiat currency and is exchangeable one-to-one with the fiat currency. Only its form is different,"" according to the RBI. The e₹-R would be in the form of a digital token that represents legal tender.Here is everthing you need to know about the pilot launch: The pilot would cover select locations in closed user group (CUG) comprising participating customers and merchants. Eight banks have been identified for phase-wise participation in this pilot. The first phase will begin with four banks: State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, and IDFC First Bank.It will be done in four cities— Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangalore and Bhubaneswar. Four more lenders comprising Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, HDFC Bank, and Kotak Mahindra Bank will join the project. The pilot would then be extended to Ahmedabad, Gangtok, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore, Kochi, Lucknow, Patna and Shimla.The scope of pilot may be expanded gradually to include more banks, users and locations as needed.How it will work:  The e₹-R would be in the form of a digital token that represents legal tender. It would be issued in the same denominations that paper currency and coins are currently issued. It would be distributed through intermediaries, i.e., banks. Users will be able to transact with e₹-R through a digital wallet offered by the participating banks and stored on mobile phones / devices. Transactions can be both Person to Person (P2P) and Person to Merchant (P2M). Payments to merchants can be made using QR codes displayed at merchant locations. The e₹-R would offer features of physical cash like trust, safety and settlement finality. As in the case of cash, it will not earn any interest and can be converted to other forms of money, like deposits with banks.""The pilot will test the robustness of the entire process of digital rupee creation, distribution and retail usage in real time. Different features and applications of the e₹-R token and architecture will be tested in future pilots, based on the learnings from this pilot,"" the RBI said in a statement. What a user must know: ■ Bank will issue digital token instead of paper currency. The retail e-rupee will be an electronic version of cash, and will be primarily meant for retail transactions. ■ It will be potentially available for use by all — the private sector, non-financial consumers and businesses — and will be able to provide access to safe money for payment and settlement■ Digital token can be kept in a digital wallet app■ Transaction can be done among those with digital wallets■ Pilot with four banks and in four citiesThere is another kind of digital rupee too On November 1, the RBI launched the digital rupee for the wholesale segment to settle secondary market transactions in government securities.Wholesale CBDC is meant for restricted access to select financial institutions. Use of e₹-W is expected to make the inter-bank market more efficient. Settlement in central bank money would reduce transaction costs by pre-empting the need for settlement guarantee infrastructure or for collateral to mitigate settlement risk. Going forward, other wholesale transactions, and cross-border payments will be the focus of future pilots, based on the learnings from this pilot.Nine banks, viz., State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, IDFC First Bank and HSBC have been identified for participation in the pilot.How is retail different from wholesale?""The model chosen for the retail rupee is different from the earlier announced for the wholesale rupee which is being used by banks for government security transactions. The token-based mechanism as announced by RBI for retail is more suited for the common retail customers both for individual customer transactions with selected merchants and also for one individual with another individual, initially to be used within the selected closed group,"" said Jyoti Prakash Gadia, Managing Director at Resurgent India- A SEBI registered category 1 merchant bank.“The participation of both merchants and customers will help in creating greater awareness and build trust around CBDC. When it comes to payments done at merchants’ outlets, QR codes are already working wonders. With e₹-R also being supported via QR codes at these outlets, we hope to see greater adoption,"" said Anand Kumar Bajaj, Founder, MD & CEO, PayNearby.What are the advantages of a digital rupee? The e₹ system is expected to bolster India’s digital economy, enhance financial inclusion, and make the monetary and payment systems more efficient. Cost-effectiveness of cash management using CBDC vis-à-vis physical currency provides a motivation for introduction of CBDC, which may be also perceived to be environment friendly. Complementing the higher cash requirement of the country, CBDC will lead to lowering of cost as it would obviate the need of many processes associated with distribution of physical currency across the country. Further, given the geographical spread and pockets where making physical cash available is a challenge, CBDC is expected to facilitate seamless transactions.According to the RBI, CBDCs have some clear advantages over other digital payments systems, as it being a sovereign currency, ensures settlement finality and thus reduces settlement risk in the financial system. CBDCs could also potentially enable a more real-time, cost-effective seamless integration of cross border payment systems. The RBI has also been concerned about money laundering, terror financing, tax evasion, etc with private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, etc. Introducing its own CBDC has been seen as a way to mitigate risks of digital currency.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-retail-digital-rupee-pilot-launch-cbdc-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/95870489.cms

It then recommended switchover to an external benchmark.Subsequently, all new floating rate personal and retail loans (housing, auto), and floating rate loans to Micro and Small Enterprises by banks were linked to an external benchmark (repo) from October 1, 2019.Banks can take the external benchmark as the RBI's repo rate or the government's treasury bill-based yields published by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd (FBIL) or any other benchmark market interest rate published by FBIL.The lenders are free to decide the spread over the external benchmark as well as to offer such external benchmark-linked loans to other types of borrowers as well.As per the RBI directions, the interest rate under the external benchmark is supposed to be reset at least once in three months.

This is the highest profit recorded by Indian banks in any quarter.After major banks reported their results on Saturday, the bank Nifty index touched 41,779 on Monday, close to its historic high of 41,840.Private banks have collectively reported a profit of Rs 33,165 crore, which is around 67% more than Rs 19,868 crore in the previous year. Public sector banks have reported a combined net of Rs 25,685 crore for Q2, up 50% from Rs 17,123 crore in FY22.More than half of the profit has been generated by SBI, which posted its highest quarterly earnings of Rs 13,256 crore, an increase of 74% over previous year. SBI’s record net has made it the most profitable company this quarter on a consolidated basis. The consolidated net profit of SBI at Rs 14,752 crore was higher than Reliance Industries’ Rs 13,656 crore. 95366810In the private sector, HDFC Bank reported a net profit of Rs 10,605 crore, an increase of 20%. ICICI Bank reported a profit of Rs 7,758 crore (up 37%), Axis Bank Rs 5,330 crore (70% gain) and Kotak Bank Rs 2,581 crore (27% increase). Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted the record performance of public sector banks on Monday and attributed it to the “continuous effort of the government for reducing non-performing assets (NPAs)”. The government had been facing flak for record losses by public sector banks in earlier years after they made provisions for bad loans to industrial houses over several quarters from 2016. For public sector banks, the profits for the first half of the current fiscal year was Rs 40,991 crore, an increase of 31% over Rs 31,290 crore in the first half of FY22.The current quarter’s rise in profit is driven by a surge in credit, which grew nearly 20%, even as banks revised their lending rate in line with RBI’s rate hikes. Banks have managed to improve their margins as cost of deposits have not risen in line with the increase in lending rates.The road to recovery has been a long one for Indian banks. In the last few years, they had to make provisions for loans worth over Rs 10 lakh crore. The recovery was aided by recapitalisation of banks with the government infusing Rs 3.1 lakh crore over the last five years. Of this capital, Rs 35,000 crore was through budgetary allocation and the remaining Rs 2,75,000 crore was by way of recapitalisation bonds, where banks lend money to the government, which hands it back as equity.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/at-60000cr-indian-banks-post-highest-profit-in-a-quarter/articleshow/95366764.cms

Online spending grew 0.7% month on mo","MUMBAI: In a pointer to consumer confidence, credit card spending in stores jumped 14% in September compared to August. Online spending grew 0.7% month on month, even as the number of credit cards shrank after banks continued to clean up their books of inactive cards.Data released by the RBI showed that the total value of spending in physical stores spiked to Rs 77,267 crore in September this year, up from Rs 67,414 crore in August 2020 — an increase of 14%. This increase coincided with the beginning of the festival season, which started with Ganesh Chaturthi in the country. The decline in the number of cards is because of a new RBI regulation that requires banks to deactivate cards that have not been used for over a month since issue. Meanwhile, e-spending, which had spiked in August due to sales by major e-commerce companies, was almost flat at Rs 45,287 crore in September compared to Rs 44,943 crore in the previous month. The RBI has only recently started giving a break-up of online and in-store spends. In September 2021, total credit card spend stood at Rs 80,227 crore compared to Rs 1,22,553 crore in September 2022.Overall, the total number of credit cards shrunk from 7.79 crore in August to 7.77 crore in September. In September, ICICI Bank’s card base shrank by 4.4%, or nearly 6.2 lakh cards to 1.3 crore. This was followed by Standard Chartered, which dropped a lakh cards (nearly 7.8%) to 12.2 lakh cards. HDFC also lost over a lakh cards with its card base now at 1.6 crore. Kotak Bank, SBM Bank and IDFC First added the most cards.

This increase coincided with the beginning of the festival season,which started with Ganesh Chaturthi in the country.95155125The decline in the number of cards is because of a new RBI regulation that requires banks to deactivate cards that have not been used for over a month since issue.

As a result, these banks have certain advantages in the funding markets.""SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank continue to be identified as Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), under the same bucketing structure as in the 2021 list of D-SIBs,"" the Reserve Bank said in a statement.In a way, these banks are considered essential for the stability of the financial system in India.The RBI first designated SBI and ICICI Bank as D-SIBs in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and HDFC Bank was classified as a D-SIB based on data from March 31, 2017. The current update is based on data from March 31, 2022.Under the framework for dealing with D-SIBs, which was issued in 2014, the RBI is required to disclose the names of D-SIBs and place them in appropriate buckets based on their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).

HDFC Bank has limited reward points from rent payments at 500 points, while Yes Bank has limited such transactions to twice a month.

Some have also sweetened the offer with cashbacks. Card issuers have not provided reasons for levying fees or capping transactions.

You are insulting the institution. People repose faith in us for getting justice,” said Justices K R Shriram and Arif Doctor. They pulled up the bank while hearing a petition filed by Kharghar businessman Vishnu Bej, who had challenged the freezing of his three bank accounts on the direction of the Central General Sales Tax (CGST) department.After receiving a September 2021 notice regarding an inquiry against his two firms, Bej appeared before the officer concerned and submitted the required documents. However, on October 4, the CGST deputy commissioner (preventive) wrote to the branch managers of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank to freeze his accounts. With the move affecting his business and his personal expenses, including the payment of his child’s school fees, Bej moved the HC. His advocate Aditi Naikare said there were no proceedings against him and no showcause notice had been issued before freezing his accounts.On August 22, 2022, the judges directed the branch heads to remain present, warning that they would pass an order to ensure their presence. On September 28, when told that Axis Bank’s branch manager Swati Jaiswal was on her way, they directed her to pay Rs 25,000 as cost to the HC Legal Aid Fund. They issued a bailable warrant of Rs 50,000 against ICICI Bank branch manager Dhiranjan Singh. On October 6, Singh was present, but Jaiswal was late again. Both were directed to explain their earlier absence. For adjourning the matter to October 12, they were directed to pay Rs 25,000 each as cost to the PM Cares Fund.On Wednesday, the judges accepted Jaiswal’s explanation and unconditional apology. However, since Singh did not give the reason for his absence, they refused to accept his explanation. “It is quite likely his boss told him, ‘Tell them (HC judges) to bugger off’,” Justice Shriram remarked. ICICI Bank’s advocate Nimay Dave said “it was an oversight on their part”.The judges said Singh’s reply that he could not remain present was nothing but a further attempt to show disrespect to the court. “His silence is very loud,” they said, adding the October 6 order clearly said he shall explain the reason for his earlier absence. On Dave’s request, they gave Singh “one more opportunity” to explain his conduct with a “warning” that if his reply was not satisfactory, they would not hesitate to issue a contempt of court notice.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bombay-hc-tears-into-bank-for-taking-it-for-granted-playing-with-it/articleshow/94822951.cms

While the repo-linked benchmark has surpassed the pre-Covid level, the marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR), which is used for loans to businesses and older home loans, continues to be below pre-Covid.Those that have increased their lending rate include the country’s largest lenders State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Bank of India, Indian Bank and Yes Bank. SBI has revised its external benchmark linked lending rate to 8.55%, while the repo-linked lending rate has been increased to 8.15%. The new loans are given at a spread over the benchmark rate. While the cost will go up for existing borrowers, the banks have the headroom to reduce the credit risk spread over the benchmark rate for new customers to keep their loans competitive.ICICI Bank raised its external benchmark lending rate to 9.25% with effect from September 30. According to the bank’s website, the interest rates on home loans begin from 8.6%, which is a 2.7% spread over the repo rate. The private lender has also increased its marginal cost of lending rate across tenures. HDFC’s new home loans also begin at 8.6% following the increase in rates.Among the public sector banks, Bank of India and Indian Bank have revised their marginal cost of lending rates. The increase in MCLR is marginal compared to the increase in the repo rate. The slower transmission of rate hikes to MCLR compared to the repo-linked rate is because the latter reflects the incremental cost of funds and banks have not increased their deposit rates in the same proportion as loans. As banks hold surplus liquidity, they are able to grow their loan books by increasing their credit to deposit ratio.According to a report by CareEdge, the share of external benchmark lending rates (EBLR) -linked loans in total outstanding floating rate rupee loans was 46.9% at the end of June this year, while that of MCLR-linked loans was 46.5%. Compared with public sector banks, private lenders have a higher share of EBLR the lending rate transmission is faster in private banks.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-hike-lending-rates-in-response-to-rbi-move/articleshow/94651632.cms

To start with the NSE Nifty 50 recovered by 16%. Further, both mid and small cap indices in broader markets picked up by 22% and 18%, respectively. According to experts, strong earnings and positive FII flows after the June debacle are to be credited for the recovery, which is likely to translate into further growth in the third and the fourth quarter of FY23.The internet is already flooded with analysis on ‘must buy/must hold’ stocks, indicating promising prospects for certain business entities and the market as a whole. These entities include banks like ICICI Bank and State Bank of India, automobile major Maruti Suzuki, leading telecom player Bharti Airtel, diversified conglomerate ITC Limited.So far this year, ICICI Bank has done well in terms of growth, margins, and asset quality. According to analysts, improving operating profits, higher loan growth, and a strong provision buffer will help the bank’s stock climb greater heights. Similarly, its overall strength in lending franchise and liability growth of over 9% guidance along with a well provisioned book are a few factors putting SBI in a position of advantage.With a series of recent launches in the compact and mid SUV segment, Maruti Suzuki, which already has a stronghold in the entry-level segment, seems to be moving towards regaining lost market share. At the same time, experts have also maintained Bharti Airtel’s ‘buy’ rating, which is based on strong growth outlook from tariff hikes with continued market share gains along with a favorable risk-reward with limited downside from current levels.  Since March this year, ITC’s share price has been consistently surging, recording a 52-week high nearing Rs 350 on 23rd September. There has been a more than 60% increase in the company’s stock value in the last few months — from Rs 207 in February to Rs 349.55 in September. Realizing that ‘digital’ and ‘sustainability’ will be the two defining trends of the future, the company, under the leadership of its Chairman Sanjiv Puri, has placed them at the center of its new growth strategy, ‘ITC Next’.The strategy lays focus on building a highly competitive, FutureTech, climate positive, and inclusive enterprise. Puri has clearly stated that the company is pursuing an accelerated journey to build a dynamic FutureTech enterprise by investing in cutting-edge digital technologies to shape a new paradigm of competitiveness, create innovative business models and tap newer opportunities. A good example of ITC’s investment in in digital and sustainability is its super app MAARS, which provides personalized and hyperlocal crop advisories to farmers. While creating new revenue streams, strengthening sourcing efficiencies, and powering some of the company’s leading brands, the app will boost farmers’ income and promote modern agriculture practices.Under Puri’s guidance, the conglomerate is also building a digital-first culture and exploring new frontiers across the entire value-chain ecosystem to add significant impetus to digital marketing, digital commerce, digital products, and digital operations.

The largest declines were recorded by HDFC Bank and Axis Bank. 94493385While the drop in numbers could be attributed to the RBI's directive, the industry also saw a month-on-month decline in total spending in August - down 3% from July. ""This is largely on account of implementation of new RBI norms. This should impact other players (like SBI Card and ICICI Bank) as well with a lag,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial research at Macquarie Capital.According to data released by the RBI, total credit card spending in shops (point of sale terminals) stood at Rs 44,943 crore in August as compared to Rs 41,766 crore in July. However, card spending online fell to Rs 67,414 crore in August compared to Rs 74,089 crore in the previous month.""The new norms requiring deactivation of 365-day inactive cards distort the market share picture (in terms of number of cards) as various players implement this with a lag. Hence, in the interim, we would not have a clear picture on market shares. However, based on card spends, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and SBI Card have gained market share of 50-70 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) in August, while ICICI Bank lost 230bps,"" said Ganapathy in his report. ""As we have highlighted before, the sharp movements here are also impacted by corporate spends - and hence it is difficult to conclude on retail market shares based on spends alone,"" he added.In August, SBI Card added added nearly 3 lakh cards on a net basis, which is higher than industry growth. ""We believe the new 'Cashback SBI Card' (released in August-end) could aid their market share further going into the festive season. SBI Card has highlighted before that 90-95% of its cards are 365-day active, and so the impact of the implementation of the new RBI norms should be limited to 5-7% of cards, in our view. This should reflect in its reported cards outstanding over the next two months,"" the report said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/number-of-credit-cards-shrink-by-23l-in-a-month/articleshow/94493314.cms

With digital transactions becoming simpler and mainstream, fraudsters are finding gullible accountholders a soft target. Bankers say that digital transactions are secure. However, fraudsters use confidence tricks to get customers to either reveal their credentials or respond to a collect request by passing it off as payment.According to Biju K, senior vice-president and chief vigilance officer, Federal Bank, the private lender uses a 3P model to combat this. ""We are constantly engaging with our clients via digital/print/other media to educate them about cyber frauds and safe banking techniques. The common man ad in TOI would be an example. Procedures: We have implemented industry best safety practices that can contain fraudulent activities at a core system level. Planning: Within the protean digital ecosystem that we operate, we have to constantly plan ahead for new vulnerabilities that may emerge. We have an expert team, on their toes, planning for any such contingencies,"" he said.The RBI has been at the forefront of the campaign having roped in Bollywood celebrities, sportspersons and even cartoon characters to raise awareness on issues such as not sharping OTP and the frauds where customers are asked to update KYC or told they have won a lottery which they have not participated in.ICICI Bank, the second largest private lender has stepped up support for seminars and workshops that are organised by the law enforcing agencies of the country. According to Anish Madhavan, head, financial crime prevention, the bank has also taken steps to ensure that even if customers are duped there is a second level of protection. ""ICICI Bank has safe and robust digital banking channels - internet banking platform and the mobile banking app, iMobile Pay - which are secured within a firewall with state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems. Further, we have leveraged technology to prevent cyber frauds and scams. For instance, we have introduced a feature in iMobile Pay that disallows any screen sharing app from viewing its screens,"" he said.HDFC Bank chief information security officer Sameer Ratolikar said, ""Fraudsters are increasingly adopting social engineering tactics to steal money from customers' bank accounts. On the pretext of offering certain services or promising help, the fraudsters are luring customers into sharing their PINs, OTPs, passwords, and other confidential banking information with them. Hence, there is a need to educate customers on safe banking habits and make them aware of the various modus operandi used by fraudsters.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banking-on-awareness-to-tackle-cyber-fraud/articleshow/93960077.cms

The KMC received several complaints that the house tax and other fees were collected but not deposited in the KMC's coffer. This system will come into force from September 1, he added.Under the new arrangement, all tax collectors would be equipped with an online billing machine to collect house tax from house owners of the city in all 110 wards. Through online payment, the system would automatically update the record and a receipt would be generated on the spot, the municipal commissioner informed.Meanwhile, KMC officials have decided to register an FIR against tax inspector Harshit Mishra who had been suspended for not depositing the house tax and mutation fee in the KMC treasury. Some consumers of zone-2 lodged a complaint before the senior officials that though they had deposited the mutation and others fees but the mutation proceedings have not been initiated. The officers after checking the mutation register found that the fee was not deposited in the KMC treasury. Bal Mukund Mishra, zonal officer of zone-2 reported the matter to the senior officials on June 20 stating that one Binu Sharma, a resident of Gopal Nagar, had deposited Rs 3,1240 as mutation fee for which a receipt was issued to him by the revenue inspector of the zone Harshit Mishra.In another matter too, he did not deposit Rs 20,580 which had been collected as mutation fee from a house owner.The KMC chief hoped that online payment mode would check manipulation and misappropriation of funds. In previous years also KMC officials received reports that the tax collectors had collected the tax but did not deposit the same in the KMC treasury, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/kanpur-house-tax-to-be-paid-online-from-september-1/articleshow/93866099.cms

The increase in interest rates are effective from June 1.HDFC’s rate revision comes close on the heels of a 30bps increase in its retail prime lending rate, which followed a 40bps hike in the RBI’s policy rate in May. Following the increase in the benchmark, the revised rate for new borrowers will be between 7. 05% and 7. 50%, depending on credit score and loan amount. The existing range is 7-7. 45%.For banks, home loans are linked to the repo rate and the 40bps hike will be transferred to borrowers. However, in the case of older loans, the rates are linked to the MCLRs, which are reviewed every month.ICICI Bank has increased its MCLR by 30bps across the board following an increase in the cost of funds consequent to the withdrawal of liquidity by the central bank. Af- ter the increase, ICICI Bank’s one-year MCLR stands at 7. 55%.Punjab National Bank has also hiked its MCLR rates by 15bps, which will increase the outgo for borrowers with older loans.Most banks review their cost of funds during the first week of the month. Given the increase in cost of funds, more such announcements are likely soon.According to bankers, the current increase in rate will not impact demand as rates are still below the prepandemic level. However, the RBI is expected to once again increase rates when it reviews its policy rate next week. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had earlier said that expectations of a rate increase were a “no brainer”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-icici-bank-pnb-increase-lending-rates/articleshow/91951557.cms

The rate at which the RBI lends,"Mumbai: Banks have started hiking their lending rates after the RBI hiked the repo rate by half a percentage point on Friday. The rate at which the RBI lends to banks is called the repo rate. While the transmission to lending rates is almost automatic due to the linkage with external benchmarks, the rise in deposit rates could be slower as there is surplus liquidity in the system, and most banks want to have a high level of credit-deposit ratio to improve margins.The lenders that have revised their rates include ICICI Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank. These banks have adjusted the external benchmark rates linked to the repo rate. According to ICICI Bank’s website, the external benchmark lending rate (I-BLR) is 9.1% from August 2022. The private lender’s best home loan rates are available at 8.1% (repo rate + 2.7%). Bank of Baroda said that the best rate under the repo-linked lending rate would be 7.6% for AAA-rated entities from August 6. According to its website, home loan rates range from 7.95% to 9.3%.SBI’s website continues to reflect the older home loan rate beginning from 7.55% (effective June 15, 2022). While the rates for existing borrowers will go up by 50bps (100bps = 1 percentage point), the bank is yet to announce the new schedule of rates. The RBI on Friday increased the repo rate to 5.4% from 4.9%.While these banks have already updated their websites, the interest rates on all loans linked to the repo rate will go up. Around 44% of all bank and most incremental home loans are linked to the repo rate. Bankers said that they do not expect the increase in rates to hit credit demand, which is picking up after two years of Covid- induced slowdown.Announcing its results on Saturday, SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said that he expected credit growth to grow at 15% during the current financial year. The bank is not growing deposits aggressively as it has a credit-deposit ratio of 63%, which gives it headroom to grow its loan book. HDFC VC & CEO Keki Mistry also said that he did not expect demand for home loans to decline because of the rate hike.According to the RBI, the shift to repo-linked rate has hastened the transmission of monetary policy action. “A survey of select banks showed that 20% of the loan book linked to external benchmark-linked rate has reset frequency less than the underlying benchmark. Over a third of the advances are at fixed rates in the case of private banks, which may experience unrealised losses through a reduction in the net present value of future cash flows in a rising interest rate cycle,” the RBI has said in its financial stability report in June 2022.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/banks-start-raising-lending-rates-after-rbis-50bps-hike/articleshow/93418734.cms

Over a third of the advances are at fixed rates in the case of private banks, which may experience unrealised losses through a reduction in the net present value of future cash flows in a rising interest rate cycle,"" the RBI has said in its financial stability report in June 2022.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-start-raising-lending-rates-after-rbis-50bps-hike/articleshow/93417737.cms

Each investor will potentially get a 10% stake in the private lender.In a statement here, the bank said it would issue 370 crore equity shares on a preferential basis for Rs 13.8 per share and 257 crore warrants at Rs 14.8 per warrant, adding Rs 8,900 crore to its equity capital base. The deal was announced after stock market trading hours, with the bank’s shares closing 2.5% up at Rs 15.SBI, HDFC, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and Kotak Mahindra Bank are among the investors who stepped in to bail out Yes Bank after its collapse two years ago. These investors have their shares locked in until March 2023 for a big chunk of their holding, and at current valuations, they would have earned a return of 50% on their investment.Speaking to TOI, Yes Bank MD & CEO Prashant Kumar said, “We are not aware of any large financial institution that has successfully come out of reconstruction. In most cases, there has either been a merger or a liquidation. We have come out successfully with the formation of a new board, and all the issues facing the bank have been addressed. There has been growth both on the loan and deposit sides. We are also innovatively addressing the NPAs (non-performing assets) by getting them off the bank’s book and ensuring that the upside in recovery continues to flow to us.”The capital raise is subject to shareholders’ approval at the EGM of the bank to be held on August 24, 2022, and relevant approvals. Once approved, this would be one of the largest private capital raises by an Indian private sector bank.“The $1.1 billion we raise and the quality of investors we bring will increase confidence. We have stood by our word and are raising fresh equity after completing two years after our initial fund raise of Rs 15,000 crore in July 2020, although many thought that we would be back earlier. And this time, the equity raise is not for survival but growth. Since the bank is out of reconstruction, the capital adequacy ratio also should be in line with peers,” said Kumar.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/carlyle-advent-to-put-1-1bn-in-yes-bk-for-10-stake-each/articleshow/93224240.cms

However, attracting depositors would be a challenge as overseas investors have an even more attractive option as US treasuries’ yield is higher than some of these deposits’ returns.Following a spike in US inflation to 9.1%, yields on short-term government bonds of one and two years jumped to 3.2% and 3.22%, respectively. Two-year US treasuries are now yielding higher returns than 30-year bonds, which offer 3.12%, reflecting an inversion in the yield curve — seen as a pointer to a recession. The country’s largest bank, SBI offers between 2.85% and 3% on dollar deposits of one-year and two-year, respectively. It offers a slightly higher 3.35% on five-year deposits.

ICICI Bank offers 3.35% on one to two-year deposits of above $350000.In the past, whenever special schemes were used to attract dollar deposits from non-residents, their interest rate differential was very high. This gave non-residents an arbitrage opportunity to move funds to India.

However, it clarified that the revision is not in response to the latest RBI move and it will take a call on revising the rates further going forward.  The largest public sector lender State Bank of India (SBI) has revised the foreign currency non-resident deposits (FCNR) rates on US dollar in the range of 2.85-3.25 per cent per annum on various tenure US dollar deposits with effect from July 10, 2022.  SBI has hiked the rate on one-year tenure FCNR USD deposits to 2.85 from 1.80 per cent earlier. For deposits of 3-4 years and 5 years, it has been hiked to 3.10 per cent and 3.25 per cent, respectively. The previous rates were 2.30 per cent and 2.45 per cent.  ICICI Bank has revised upwards FCNR by 0.15 per cent on deposits of higher than and equal to USD 350,000 for 12-24 months tenure to 3.50 per cent.

Equitas Small Finance Bank also announced the revision of interest rates for fixed and recurring deposits of Non Resident External (NRE) account with effect from July 13, 2022.  It has increased NRE interest rate up to 7.40 per cent for NRE FD for 888 days and up to 7.30 per cent for NRE RD for 36 months.

For US dollar deposits, the lender offers an interest rate of 3.50 per cent in deposits ranging from 1 year to less than 5 years. For 5-year tenure USD deposits, it offers 2.50 per cent interest rate.

The court said the state also could not be faulted for any ""non-transparent or opaque procedure for sale of shares"".In an 18-page judgment, the HC dismissed Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's plea seeking a probe by a high-powered committee, headed by a sitting HC judge, into the share transfers. Both CBI and Enforcement Directorate had questioned several senior officers on this issue. The central agencies were also made party to the case.A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj in its order said policy decisions by the state, based on economic and other considerations, is not open to judicial interference ""unless the same is unconstitutional, violative of statutory provision, totally arbitrary or suffers from the vice of malice"". The HC said courts will ""interfere if any illegality is committed"", and it is not for the courts to ""consider the relative merits of different economic policies"".The HC further said disinvestment of shares ""is a policy decision involving complex economic factors and it is not for the court to examine whether the policy of a particular disinvestment was desirable or not"".

The best home loans from the country's largest housing finance company HDFC will now start from 7.55%. Early last month, HDFC was offering home loans to its top customers at 6.7%. The company raised rates by 30 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) after the central bank did an off-cycle rate hike on May 4. Beginning of June, it again raised rates by 5bps following an increase in interest rates in the system. According to HDFC officials the increase in rates were unlikely to impact demand as home loans continue to be 50-60bps below the pre-pandemic level.The latest round of increases comes in the wake of the RBI increasing the repo rates by 50bps to 4.9% on Wednesday. Responding to the RBI action, ICICI Bank on Thursday said on its website that its external benchmark lending rate (EBLR) is referenced to the RBI policy repo rate with a mark-up. The EBLR is now 8.6% effective June 8.In the private sector, RBL Bank's repo-linked lending rate shot up to 10% after a 50bps increase. Federal Bank said that its best home loan rates are now 8.55% - an increase in line with the RBI policy rate movement.Consultancy firm The Guardians Real Estate Advisory's chairman Kaushal Agarwal said, ""The rise in property prices due to the increased interest rates, metro cess and higher stamp duty has not affected sales in the past couple of months, which proves that there is a genuine demand. The move to hike the repo rate might temporarily limit the growth momentum of the sector, but the demand will continue to sustain.""Retail borrowers will be the most hit by the increase in lending rates as corporates have deleveraged and have less loans on their books than before. As against this, retail borrowings have increased. According to data released by the RBI, non-food bank credit has increased by Rs 76,460 crore in April. The increase was driven by personal loans, which grew by Rs 57,166 crore. The other sectors that grew were agriculture, MSMEs, trade and non-banking finance companies.Total outstanding in the personal loan segment is now at Rs 34.4 lakh crore, half of which is housing. As against this, loans to industry stands at Rs 31.5 lakh crore, of which large industry is Rs 23.9 lakh crore. In percentage terms, the fastest growing segment in April this year was credit card outstandings, which jumped 4% to Rs 1.53 lakh crore from Rs 1.47 lakh crore in end March.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-raise-loan-rates-day-after-rbis-repo-hike/articleshow/92114769.cms

ICICI,2022-06-03T09:39:00+05:30,Sunainaa Chadha,Banks are increasing loan rates: Why your CIBIL score matters more now than ever,India Business News: A good credit score helps you get the best loans and credit card offers basis your eligibility. It is a three-digit number between 300 and 900 and is ,"NEW DELHI: Several public and private sector banks have increased their home and auto loan interest rates from June 1 after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised India's repo rate by 40 basis last month. When the repo rate is high, the cost of funds is higher for banks , resulting in rising interest rates for home , car and personal loans. But did you know that if your credit score is high, you can avail the lowest interest rate possible with banks?Your CIBIL score tells the bank of how well you can manage your credit as well as your ability to opt for loans and repay them.How and what affects one’s credit scores?Credit score is a 3-digit number which determines one’s ability to repay the credit on time, in other words it is a proof of one’s credit worthiness. ""While the credit score is given out of 900, any score above 750 is considered to be a healthy score. .Any score lower than 720 is considered to be a ow score and can restrict your ability to acquire credit.There is no single feature which decides how good or bad one’s score is but a list of factors cumulatively affects an individual’s credit score,"" said Anurag Sinha, Cofounder & CEO, OneScore & OneCard, a veteran in the consumer credit space.These include: Past credit repayments, credit utilisation, umber of hard inquiries, credit mix, any settled loan, which is still showing as active, despite the payment being done, irregular address details among numerous accounts, a timely credit repayment history, a lesser number of loans availed, having a healthy mix of different credit products, and keeping a check on one’s credit card bills.Hence, the CIBIL score is computed by TransUnion CIBL credit bureau after considering your past payments, credit history, current and old credit accounts, among others. Benefits of a high CIBIL scoreA higher CIBIL score will put you in a position to negotiate with lenders to get a lower interest rate on the loan. There are several lenders who offer preferential pricing on loan interest rates to people who have a high credit score.According to BankBazaar, interest rate on a home loan or a car loan varies from bank to bank, however, if you have a high CIBIL score, you can get a discount on the interest rate. If you have a CIBIL score of 750 and above, banks will offer you loans at a competitive interest rate.Banks charge cheaper interest rates for consumers with high CIBIL score and higher interest rates for people with a low or poor CIBIL score. Therefore, it is important to build a good credit profile and monitor your CIBIL score from time-to-time.For example, State Bank of India offers interest rates based on the CIBIL score. Regular SBI home loans have an interest rate of 7.05 percent for credit scores more than or equal to 800. The interest rate is 7.35 percent for credit scores 650-699, and 7.55 percent for credit scores 550-649. The interest rate is 7.25 percent with NTC/no CIBIL score.Housing Development Finance Corp has also hiked its retail prime lending rate (RPLR) by 5 basis points (bps), its third increase in a month. The latest increase means the minimum rate for a borrower with a credit score of more than 780 is now at 7.05%. borrowers below a credit score of 780 will have to pay a minimum of 7.15% for loans up to 30 lakh and 7.40% for loans between 30 lakh and 75 lakh.""A good credit score helps you get the best loans and credit card offers basis your eligibility. Every lender you apply for a loan or credit card will check it and base your offering on your credit score. Your credit score is contained in your credit report, which carries a summary of your previous history, which will show whether you’ve paid your debts in full and on time. You enjoy multiple benefits of a good credit score, and a lower interest rate is one of them. Almost all lenders consider a credit score of 750 and above as ideal. They offer lower interest rates to applicants with high credit scores as such borrowers pose less risk and are less likely to default on payments. With a high credit score, you can negotiate for lower interest rates and request to waive off some of the additional charges,"" said Adhil Shetty, CEO, Bankbazaar.com.More importantly, banks check on your CIBIL score to analyse if you’ve ever defaulted in your financial journey in the past as it would have been recorded on your CIBIL report. So, if your CIBIL score is good, the lender won’t hesitate before granting a loan. But a bad CIBIL score might lead to loan rejection as the lender is unsure of your creditworthiness.A good CIBIL score will also ensure that you get a housing loan without any hassles whatsoever and the same things holds true for availing a place on rent.A good or high CIBIL score will also ensure that you get approval for higher limits from the bank.How can you improve your credit score?""Timely repayment of the EMIs, paying more than minimum due on credit card bills can help you improve your credit score,"" said OneScore's Sinha.You should use only 15-30% of your credit card limit. Using your credit limit to the fullest suggests that you are credit hungry and are not able to handle your finances.Another trick, according to BankBazaar, is to request your bank to increase the credit limit on your credit card. Once the credit limit is increased, you should keep the credit utilisation low. This will suggest that you are not credit hungry and are able to handle the credit.A long credit history will help you improve your CIBIL score. So, if you have old credit cards with a good credit history, it is better to not close them. When you close your credit cards, you lose out on good credit history and that can hamper your CIBIL score.Fix errors in your CIBIL report (if any): If you have seen a sudden decrease in your CIBIL score, you should check your credit report as it could have errors.""Regular monitoring of the credit score, avoiding sharing personal details on online platforms, unverified apps, and immediately reporting any error can help safeguarding your credit health against identity frauds,"" said Sinha.How to get credit scores rectified and long-term implications of the same on the score?When one finds an error in his/her credit report, the first step is to file an online complaint with the credit bureau to dispute the error. Once the form is submitted, the credit bureau approaches the bank to verify the errors as it cannot resolve the errors on its own.Post the confirmation from the bank, the bureau and the bank come up with a formal solution to the discrepancy within 45 days of the complaint. The user is then informed about the error in the revised score. If the discrepancies aren’t identified on time, it might lead to the downfall of credit score and users would have to go for a secured product to repair his/her credit score. That will take its own due course of time,"" explained Sinha.How you can check your CIBIL score:Go to the official CIBIL website https://www.cibil.comSelect 'Get your CIBIL ScoreClick on ""Click here"" to get your free Annual CIBIL ScoreType your name, email ID, and password.

ICICI,2022-06-02T08:14:00+05:30,TNN,"HDFC, ICICI Bk, PNB increase lending rates", Interest rates on loans are on the rise again. The country’s largest housing finance company HDFC hiked its benchmark rates by 5 basis points (100bps,"Mumbai: Interest rates on loans are on the rise again. The country’s largest housing finance company HDFC hiked its benchmark rates by 5 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point), while ICICI Bank revised its marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) by 30bps. The increase in interest rates are effective from June 1. HDFC’s rate revision comes close on the heels of a 30bps increase in its retail prime lending rate, which followed a 40bps hike in the RBI’s policy rate in May. Following the increase in the benchmark, the revised rate for new borrowers will be between 7.05% and 7.50%, depending on credit score and loan amount. The existing range is 7-7.45%.For banks, home loans are linked to the repo rate and the 40bps hike will be transferred to borrowers. However, in the case of older loans, the rates are linked to the MCLRs, which are reviewed every month. ICICI Bank has increased its MCLR by 30bps across the board following an increase in the cost of funds consequent to the withdrawal of liquidity by the central bank. After the increase, ICICI Bank’s one-year MCLR stands at 7.55%. Punjab National Bank has also hiked its MCLR rates by 15bps, which will increase the outgo for borrowers with older loans. Most banks review their cost of funds during the first week of the month. Given the increase in cost of funds, more such announcements are likely soon.According to bankers, the current increase in rate will not impact demand as rates are still below the pre-pandemic level. However, the RBI is expected to once again increase rates when it reviews its policy rate next week. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had earlier said that expectations of a rate increase were a “no brainer”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hdfc-icici-bk-pnb-increase-lending-rates/articleshow/91952415.cms

LIC’s shares fell 3% or by over Rs 25 to Rs 811, bringing down its market capitalisation to Rs 5.1 lakh crore. On May 17, when LIC got listed on stock exchanges, the corporation was the fifth biggest company with a market cap of over Rs 5.5 lakh crore.91928882LIC on Monday declared its quarterly results for the first time, where it appeared that profit for the March quarter was down 18% from the year-ago period. The corporation reported a net profit of Rs 4,043 crore for the full year — a 39% increase over the previous year. LIC’s top management addressed a press conference on Tuesday and clarified that its Q4 results were not indicative of performance as base figures for comparison were not available. LIC also said key data that analysts look for, such as the value of new business and embedded value, would be available only by June-end.According to LIC MD Raj Kumar, the drop was because the profits for FY21 were bunched up as there was no quarterly profit in the first quarter. “We were not declaring quarterly profits before listing and we started only in the quarter ended September 2021. The comparison was not three months compared to three months but it was for the full year for FY21,” said Kumar. He added that even the profit for Q1FY23 could not be compared to Q1FY22 as no profit were reckoned for that quarter.Kumar said that computing the value of the new business was taking time as the corporation had 285 products and the value contributed by each would have to be computed for which new software was put in place.Kumar said that the corporation realised Rs 42,000 crore during the year by way of the sale of equity investments, which is a 17% increase over Rs 36,000 crore in the previous year. He said that the corporation has to park half its investible resources in government securities mandatorily. He added that the corporation’s growth driver for the current year will be non-par products, including ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans) and term covers. Kumar said that the corporation was hit by higher claims due to Covid and the maturity of four high-value products with maturity claims of over Rs 5 lakh. “One hopes that we do not see any more waves but we have created a Rs 7,400-crore reserve fund to take care of Covid claims.” ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lic-mcap-falls-below-icici-bk-to-7th-place/articleshow/91926649.cms

According to the bank, the platform brings to even small proprietorship firms value-added services that were hitherto available to corporates.

The offloading in the US, mainly on the back of fears of aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed to tame inflation — along with weakness in other global markets — impacted sentiment in the domestic bourses, brokers and dealers said.Thursday’s selloff in the Indian market was led by Infosys, Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, BSE data showed. ITC, on the other hand, rallied over 3% to cushion the slide partially.According to Axis Securities chief investment officer Naveen Kulkarni, growth momentum in the global economy is slowing down due to liquidity tightening by central banks. “The Russia–Ukraine conflict is also not showing any signs of easing with newer categories of weapons being introduced in the conflict, which will keep energy and food prices high. Both these variables point to a stagflation kind of scenario globally, which can lead to discretionary spending going down. This is fuelling greater volatility in global equity markets, including in India.” Stagflation describes a period when there is rising inflation even as employment rate and demand fall in an economy. Kulkarni expects markets to remain volatile in the near term but sees better conditions in the second half of the financial year once investors price in the impact of the global slowdown and higher rates.Like in the past few sessions, Thursday’s selling on D-Street was also led by foreign funds. BSE data showed that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at Rs 4,900 crore. On the other hand, domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 3,226 crore. The day’s FPI outflow from the stock market took the current month’s tally to over Rs 36,000 crore, which is more than February’s figure of Rs 35,592 crore but less than March’s Rs 41,123 crore, CDSL and BSE data showed. Thursday’s slide left investors poorer by Rs 6.7 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 252.4 lakh crore, official data showed. The day’s market cap drop was the second biggest in 2022, behind a Rs 8.9-lakh-crore loss on January 24. Thursday’s selling also left investors in LIC poorer by over 4% during the day after the stock, which dived to its life-low level of Rs 839 on the BSE, ended at Rs 841.

Before","New Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch was an executive director at ICICI Bank and before that she headed the lender's broking arm, ICICI Securities. Before joining Sebi, she also had a short stint at a private equity firm in Singapore.The government decision to appoint Buch to head one of the most important financial sector regulatory bodies in the country also signals that the incumbent Ajay Tyagi, who was eligible for a fresh term for a little under two years, may have been denied an extension or reappointment due to the recent revelations regarding National Stock Exchange and its former MD Chitra Ramkrishna. Various commentators have pointed out that the market regulator under Tyagi had not used all the instruments available at its disposal to nail down the culprits at NSE.Buch grew up in Delhi where she finished her schooling at Convent of Jesus and Mary and then earned a bachelor's degree from St Stephen's College. She then went to IIM-Ahmedabad, graduating in 1988, a year after Raghuram Rajan, former RBI governor. Subsequently in 1989, she joined ICICI as a project finance analyst in Mumbai. After a few years with ICICI, she left the lender and relocated to London when her husband, Dhaval Buch, was posted with global FMCG giant Unilever.In an interview with TOI in August 2010, Buch had said that while in London, she had worked on the shop floors of a departmental store, earning 4 pounds per hour. A few months later, she took up a job as a data entry operator at a college and then as a part-time lecturer at the same institution where she taught accountancy and organisational structure to earn 20 pounds per hour. ""It was a major upgrade,"" she had told TOI with a chuckle. For her, no job is inferior and she knows how to pay respect to dignity of labour. In 1997, Buch came back to India and rejoined ICICI Bank. In 2009, just after the global financial crisis was coming to an end and when the financial services industry globally was going through a challenging phase, she was appointed to head ICICI Securities. After running I-Sec for two years, she left the group and relocated to Singapore with her husband.Between 2011 and 2017, she was on the boards of several top Indian companies and also with a private equity firm in Singapore. In April 2017, she was appointed as a WTM at Sebi which she left in October 2022.As Sebi chief, Buch's immediate challenge will be to restore the trust in Indian markets, which has been dented due to the controversy at NSE. She also needs to ensure smooth sailing for the mega IPO of LIC, estimated to be around Rs 65,000 crore or more, that will make it the biggest public offering in India. In addition, she will also need to carry forward the reforms in the financial market with special focus on retail investors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/buch-was-i-sec-md-icici-bank-director/articleshow/89911333.cms

Among the stocks that accounted the most for the sensex’s loss were HDFC Bank, RIL, HDFC and ICICI Bank, BSE data showed.The day’s selloff also left investors poorer by nearly Rs 5.6 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 244.1 lakh crore. So far in May, the market’s slide has shaved off a little over Rs 26 lakh crore from investors’ wealth, official data showed.Inflation continues to be a major concern for the markets, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka. During the day, market players were also eagerly waiting for the government to announce the retail inflation numbers for April. After market hours, it came in at a multi-year high of 7.79% with food inflation at 8.38%. Market players expect this to affect investor sentiment negatively during Friday’s session too. A weak US market on Thursday night would also weigh on the sentiment, they said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/perfect-storm-pulls-sensex-down-1158-pts-to-below-53k/articleshow/91527457.cms

And the March 2020 rescue of Yes Bank, a mid-sized private-sector bank, reinforces our view.The negative outlook on the ratings mirrors the agency's outlook on the sovereign rating, it said.In the view of the agency, the bank's risk profile has a stronger impact than the operating environment on the assigned viability rating than what the weighting would suggest.The bank's appetite for risk, even though it is lower than before the pandemic, has weighed on its financial metrics in the past several years, particularly in terms of asset quality and earnings.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fitch-affirms-icici-bank-rating-with-negative-outlook/articleshow/88002957.cms

Separate instructions would be issued to NPCI, ATM networks and banks shortly,"" noted Das.A Cardless Cash Withdrawal transaction allows the sender to send money from a Bank account to anyone in India who has a valid mobile phone number.Without having to utilise an ATM or a Debit Card, the beneficiary can withdraw the funds from the ATM.NCR Corporation, which is responsible for making automated teller machines aka ATMs, launched a UPI-enabled interoperable cardless cash withdrawing system in India in partnership with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and City Union Bank in April 2021.The solution allows dynamic QR code-based interoperable cardless cash withdrawals.

Banks like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank currently offer this service for their users.""Apart from making digital payments seamless, one of the biggest contributions of UPI was facilitating a standardised flow for secure authentication to a bank account. This use case was made ubiquitous with the ability to integrate not just with banking apps but third party apps like Google Pay and PhonePe as well. There are a lot more use cases for UPI and this is what we are seeing with cardless withdrawals from ATMs.While some banks have enabled this already, it's great to see that all banks would soon support this feature, which would further increase convenience and improve security,"" said Sumit Gwalani, co-founder of neobank Fi.If you are an ICICI Bank customer, ""all you need is to log in to iMobile and initiate a Cardless Cash withdrawal transaction.

In the biggest merger in the corporate history, India's largest housing finance company HDFC will merge with the country's largest private lender HDFC Bank to create a banking behemoth.  Once the deal is effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 per cent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 per cent of the bank, according to stock exchange filings by the firms.  S&P said the merger will likely result in significant market-share gains for HDFC Bank, given HDFC (the parent) is the largest financier of mortgages in India. It will raise HDFC Bank's loans by 42 per cent to Rs 18 lakh crore ($237 billion), increasing the bank's market share to about 15 per cent, from 11 per cent currently.  ""While HDFC Bank will remain the second-largest bank in India post-merger, it will be twice the size of ICICI Bank Ltd, the third-largest bank in the country. HDFC Bank's larger balance sheet could enhance its wholesale lending opportunities,"" it said.  State-owned SBI is the largest bank in the country.  The merger is subject to regulatory and other approvals and could take 12-18 months to complete, it said.  ""HDFC Bank Ltd's planned merger with its parent will boost the India-based bank's market share and diversify its revenues,"" S&P said in a statement.  It said HDFC Bank's business profile will diversify after the merger and the merged entity will have one-third of its portfolio in mortgage loans, compared with a reported 11 per cent now.  S&P said the combined entity's earnings could improve over the next three to five years and the merger will provide the bank with profitable cross-selling opportunities to HDFC's large pool of customers.  ""The merged bank will benefit from economies of scale and an improved ability to raise funds at competitive rates. It can also leverage HDFC Bank's digital capabilities and distribution network to drive operational efficiencies,"" it said.  S&P expects the combined entity's capitalization and asset quality to be broadly in line with those of HDFC Bank on a standalone basis.  About 9 per cent of HDFC Ltd's portfolio comprises loans to real estate developers, where the asset quality is weaker than for the rest of the bank's portfolio. ""In our view, HDFC Bank should be able to absorb incremental risks from this portfolio given its adequate capital and provisioning buffers,"" the US-based rating agency said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-merger-to-create-entity-twice-the-size-of-icici-bank-sp/articleshow/90641663.cms

The company is accused of allegedly siphoning off bank loans and is facing liquidation through an insolvency process at the National Company Law Tribunal.The company took massive loans from several banks, and then diverted them to overseas subsidiaries, bought assets and even transferred money to several related parties. The fraud was spread over six years.The main charges are diversion of bank funds to group companies and the purchase of assets by related parties using bank funds.What has the probe revealed so far?The CBI probe has revealed that atleast 98 companies were floated by the accused to divert funds, which were then used to create personal assets and for the purpose of evergreening of loans. The critical period of the investigation is between 2005 and 2012.The company availed 3 types of loans from 28 different banks, and the money raised was then diverted through 98 sister concern companies. The scam involves circular transactions and the use of shell companies to layer them.CBI has already raided 13 locations, including the premises of the accused, which led to the recovery of incriminating documents.Who blew the cover?The alleged fraud was flagged during a forensic audit of the loan account's transactions from April 2012 to July 2017. A review of ledgers showed that funds were being transferred between ABG Group companies. The ‘accused’ colluded and committed illegal activities, including diversion of funds, misappropriation and criminal breach of trust and for purposes other than for the purpose for which the funds are released by the bank.ABG Shipyard had subscribed to ABG Singapore preference shares amounting to $43.5 million. Financial statements of ABG Singapore for 2010 and 2011 showed loans obtained from ABG Shipyard and foreign investment made by ABG Singapore. It is suspected that the payments made to ABG Singapore by ABG Shipyard was to divert the bank funds. It has also been alleged that properties were bought using security deposits of ABG Shipyard Singapore.The forensic report also uncovered that ABG Shipyard made pay-outs to related parties including Rs 603 crore to One Ocean Shipping and Rs 812 crore to ABG Engineering and Construction by passing a joint venture entry on March 31, 2016.The audit also questions about investments through an overseas subsidiary and indicated that properties had been purchased by related parties with funds provided by ABG Shipyard but the assets purchased were never part of the fixed assets in the books of the company.Reports suggest that the money borrowed from banks was used to repay loans and pay for other expenses of group companies.The lead bankers were ICICI Bank and IDBI Bank but the complaint was first filed by State Bank of India (SBI) to CBI in 2019. <iframe title=""Of the total Rs 22,842 crore exposure to ABG Shipyard, it owes ICICI Rs 7,089 crore, SBI Rs 2,925 crore, IDBI Bank Rs 3,639 crore"" aria-label=""Column Chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-M3sMB"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/M3sMB/1/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""400""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>What does the SBI complaint say?As per the FIR filed on SBI’s complaint, a forensic audit conducted by Ernst & Young revealed that from April 2012 to June 2017, loans given to the company were siphoned off and were also used to purchase assets for its related parties. The company allegedly also invested some of those loans in its overseas subsidiary.What are the allegations?1. SBI in its complaint alleged that ABG Shipyard routed around Rs 1,415 crore through various vendors and group companies to repay its own dues2. ABG Shipyard invested money in its overseas arm ABG Singapore, which were then eventually completely siphoned off the system.3. ABG Shipyard transferred money worth Rs 83 crore to seven different related companies and then this money was used to buy properties, but it never showed up as the company's fixed assets.4. More than 50% of the customer receipts were received in accounts outside the Trust and Retention Account, which is a breach of the restructuring scheme at ABG Shipyard. SBI alleged that the company, whose account became a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) in 2013, violated the terms of its arrangement for Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) which mentioned that “all cash inflows should be routed through the trust and retention account.""ABG hit by the global crisisThe FIR also stated the company was affected by the global financial crisis of 2008, leading to it becoming a non-performing asset in 2013. Trouble started during the economic slowdown that followed the global financial crisis of 2007-08, resulting in the collapse of the shipbuilding business, which led to inventory pile up as well as loss of orders and finally loan defaults.Due to the crisis, there was a paucity of working capital which caused “significant increase in the operating cycle, thereby aggravating the liquidity and financial problem”. SBI said several attempts were made to revive ABG SL’s operations such as restructuring the account under the CDR mechanism in March 2014 by all lenders. However, as the shipping industry was going through a “down turn, one of the worst ever seen, the operations of the company could not revive”.There was no demand for commercial vessels and there were no fresh defence orders, which is why ABG was unable to service the interest and instalments on the due date. Since restructuring failed, the account was classified as an NPA in July 2016 with back-dated effect from 30 November 2013. In total, ABG Shipyard owes Rs 22,842 crore to 28 lenders including SBI, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, Life Insurance Corporation of India, IFCI and Yes Bank.Then why the delay in filing a complaint?Even though the account was declared an NPA in 2016, SBI only identified the fraud in January 2019 . E&Y was appointed as Forensic Auditor by lenders during April 2018 and they submitted their report in January 2019.Despite this report being released in January 2019, SBI filed a complaint only in November that year. However, its complaint was returned by the CBI, seeking an internal investigation by the bank, including the details of fraud committed on other banks which are a part of the consortium. A year later, SBI filed a fresh complaint in informing the CBI that staff accountability had been dealt with and closed by the competent authority and it was found that its staff was not involved in the alleged fraud. After ""scrutinising"" the complaint for a year and a half, the CBI acted on the complaint, filing an FIR on February 7 2022.The politics of the case: The Congress party on Sunday took issue with the timeline of the events. ""Why did it take five years after the liquidation proceedings of ABG Shipyard to lodge even an FIR for duping 28 banks of Rs 22,842 crore?"" the party's general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala asked. ""Why was no FIR was lodged and criminal action taken despite their accounts having been declared as fraud on June 19, 2019?"" he asked.To this, SBI responded saying ""At no point in time, there was any effort to delay the process. ""The first complaint was filed with CBI in November 2019. There was a continuous engagement between CBI and Banks and further information was getting exchanged,"" the lender said. ""The circumstances of the fraud, as well as CBI requirements, were further deliberated in the various meetings of Joint Lenders and a fresh and comprehensive second complaint was filed in December 2020.""An SBI statement further detailed that ""Typically when fraud is declared, an initial complaint is preferred with CBI, and based on their enquiries further information is gathered. In a few cases, when substantial additional information is gathered, a second complaint incorporating full and complete details is filed which forms the basis for the FIR. At no point in time, there was any effort to delay the process. The lender’s forum diligently follows through with CBI in all such cases"".The CBI defence: The agency has clarified that the withdrawal for general consent by certain states was one of the reasons for the delay in lodging an FIR. "". ""There are around 100 high value bank fraud cases that could not be registered due to non-accordance of of specific consent u/s 6 of DSPE Act by State governments where the general consent has been withdrawn,"" said the CBI release.FM Nirmala Sitharaman backs SBIOn Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said there was no delay as determining the elements of fraud usually takes “52 to 56 months”. “The process has been going on since 2014. In general, for any account, determining the element of fraud takes almost 52-54 months. I should say to the credit of the banks, they have taken less time than the average to detect the fraud. A forensic audit was done. All evidence was collected and given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Meanwhile, in parallel, an NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) process is also ongoing,” Sitharaman said.The land favour allegation:The Congress has also claimed that ABG Shipyard was allotted 1.21 lakh square metres of land in 2007 by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Gujarat.“The CAG indicted the Gujarat government for showing undue favour to ABG Shipyard by allotting land at Rs 700 per square metre, while the price of land was 100 per cent higher at Rs 1,400 per square metre.”Surjewala said that despite the adverse CAG report, the Gujarat government headed by Modi went on to allot 50 hectares of land to ABG Shipyard in Dahej. The Dahej project was shut down in 2015.Lookout notice: Lookout circulars have been issued against the bosses and senior executives of ABG Shipyard to stop them from leaving the country via airports and border crossings. The Directors of the shipping firm include Rishi Agarwal, Santhanam Muthuswamy and Ashwini Kumar. The suspect directors of the shipping firm have been located in India and are being probed.The latest lookout circular in the ABG Shipyard case adds to a long list of similar cases in the country, from the Punjab National Bank fraud involving businessmen Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi to the defunct Kingfisher Airlines' boss Vijay Mallya's bank loan default. All of them are fighting extradition to India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-what-the-sbi-abg-shipyard-rs-22892-crore-controversy-is-all-about/articleshow/89607587.cms

While one section is advising the government not to take a hasty decision without understanding the use cases, the other is against continuing the status quo despite the difficulty in defining crypto.ICICI Bank’s group general counsel Pramod Rao has said, “The government’s pause (on introducing the crypto bill in Parliament) is a good thing for us to wait and watch, and decide whether we need a separate regulator, which can transcend into all use cases.”However, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas partner Anu Tiwari said that it will take a few years for a new regulator to attain maturity — which is too long a time for crypto. According to Tiwari, Sebi is the practical choice for regulating crypto despite challenges like identifying issuers of tokens. 89234857The legal experts were speaking in a webinar organised by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy on Saturday.According to Rao, regulation is aimed at having transparent rules that are commonly applied. One cannot expect regulation to be a safety net for investors. Rao said it is incumbent on the domestic crypto industry to keep enhancing the level of disclosures. Rao also said that in the case of regulation, the application of several existing laws will have to be considered. “Crypto trading may already be contravening the exchange control norms under FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act),” he said.Sriram Chakravarthi, partner at Singapore-based law firm Rajah & Tann, too said the status quo cannot continue. “It is better to have a process of constant evolution, consultation and then come up with guidelines, etc, and looking at how they work rather than the wait-and-watch approach,” said.Rao said that Sebi was more aligned to regulate the category of stablecoins — cryptocurrencies linked to an underlying asset like gold or dollar. Crypto is generated by automated algorithms. “Is the developer — the algorithm’s creator — the one you want to hold responsible? What if they are not situated in India?” Rao asked.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/legal-experts-split-over-crypto-regulation/articleshow/89230329.cms

After the 656-point drop on Wednesday, the sensex has lost 1,210 overall in two sessions to settle at 60,099 with IT stocks witnessing strong selling.The selloff in the domestic market was in reaction to a slide in global markets, analysts said. This also took a heavy toll on several of the recently listed stocks, some of which dipped to life-low levels. Among the sensex stocks, the day's session saw Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC and TCS lead the slide, while buying in SBI and Maruti cushioned the fall partially. The selloff was led by foreign funds which recorded a net outflow of Rs 2,705 crore, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 195 crore, BSE data showed. Wednesday's selling also left investors poorer by about Rs 1.4 lakh crore, with the BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 277.8 lakh crore. 89010252Global markets continued to see a selloff as US treasury yield surged to a near two-year high, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka.

The sensex surged 929 points, or 1.6%, to 59,183, supported by financials and Reliance Industries the most. The reversal of foreign fund selling in the last few days due to the ongoing holiday season in most developed markets also helped the rally, market players said.The day’s session saw banking & financials along with metal stocks lead the rally while healthcare stocks, despite the rising uncertainty because of the spread of Omicron, witnessed selling pressure. As a result, the BSE’s financial, banking and metal indices closed with gains of over 2%, while the healthcare index closed marginally lower.According to Rahul Sharma of Equity99 Advisors, the expectation on the street is that the positive momentum would continue for a while. “However, investors are advised to keep some capital aside to take advantage of any major dips considering the rising Omicron infections. The pharma sector could be a great bet looking at the current scenario,” he said.The day’s session also made investors richer by about Rs 2.5 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 272.5 lakh crore. In the near term, the stock market is expected to witness some up-move, supported mainly by local investors — both institutional and individual. But a definitive trend would emerge from the third week of the month, market players said. This is because that’s when most foreign fund managers would resume after their new year break. That would also be the time when leading Indian companies would start announcing their quarter results.In a surprising move, TCS, Infosys and Wipro — all three among the largest software exporters from India — would announce their quarterly results on the same day, that is, January 12. HCL Technologies, another leading software exporter, would announce its results on January 14. The results season will kick off with Q3 results from Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart) on January 8, data from BSE showed.As it happens during the announcement of quarterly results, to some extent, this time too financial numbers from leading companies would impact investor sentiment on D-Street, dealers said. The recent reversal in selling by foreign portfolio investors has also helped the Indian currency. From a multi-month low at about 76 to a dollar level in early December, the rupee on Monday closed at 74.26 to a dollar. In the bond market too, despite the RBI’s recent decision to cancel some of its borrowing plans through government securities, the benchmark yield on the 10-year gilts is hovering at the 6.45% level. On Monday, the yield closed at 6.46%.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-starts-2022-with-a-bang-gains-929-pts-to-59k/articleshow/88675075.cms

The report expects the deal momentum to continue on the back of growing investor demand and ample liquidity as companies reshape their businesses through M&As.M&As reached a three-year high at $125.7 billion, up 53.7 per cent over 2020. While average deal value was $95 million, up 15.5 per cent, there were 21 deals of over $1 billion, with a cumulative total of $50 billion, up from 16 deals worth $34.6 billion in 2020.Domestic M&As amounted to $44.9 billion, up 22.6 per cent, led by Piramal Finance acquiring DHFL for $4.7 billion, making it the largest deal of the year.Inbound M&As nearly doubled (up 93.1 per cent) to reach $69.8 billion, the highest annual period since records began in 1980.The US was the most active foreign acquirer with $33.3 billion worth of deals.Outbound M&As hit a three-year high at $6.9 billion, up 57 per cent from a year ago and Britain was the most targeted nation in terms of value by domestic companies with 22 deals worth $2.3 billion which is 33 per cent of the total, while the US saw the highest number of acquisitions with 58 deals worth $1.9 billion and 27.4 per cent market share.Majority of the deal making was in the financials sector at $29.8 billion, up 171.3 per cent from 2020, which was 23.7 per cent of all deals.Primary bond offerings saw issuers raising $58.6 billion in 2021, down 20.2 per cent in proceeds from 2020, making it the lowest period since 2018 when it was $46.2 billion.

This is part of the bank’s ‘Axis One’ strategy where it approaches the customers offering its entire gamut of products instead of a standalone service.“We are making aggressive strides in merchant-acquiring. We are not looking at merchants as just someone who acquires a point-of-sale (PoS) terminal but as an opportunity to open a new current account for their business, personal savings account and an opportunity to provide loans and insurance protection. We are growing this business by offering new products to the payment products merchant,” said Axis Bank executive VP & head (cards & payments) Sanjeev Moghe.The bank’s market share in the number of devices has gone up from 15% in January this year to 16% up to October. Its share in spending is even larger as the bank is constantly tracking the number of inactive terminals. “We have speeded up the onboarding process by making it completely paperless. While the onboarding is still done in the presence of the merchant for Know-Your-Customer requirements, we are working on ways to do it remotely,” said Moghe.The sharp jump in the onboarding of merchants — including small shops, organised retail and e-commerce merchants — took place after the bank decided to stop looking at these card-swipe machines as a profit stream. “The business model is a loss-making one if you look at it purely as the difference between what you earn from the merchant for the transaction versus what you pay as interchange. This is why many banks have chosen not to do this and instead outsource to partners or joint ventures. We have decided to keep this business within the bank,” said Moghe.Currently, HDFC Bank dominates the merchant-acquiring space followed by Axis Bank, which has overtaken SBI and ICICI Bank, both of which have hived off merchant-acquiring to an associate company.Axis Bank’s strategy to increase the number of merchants is to offer the latest in technology to them and address pain points. For instance, the bank installs Android PoS machines and has also come out with a printer-less compact machine. “The charge slip is no longer required for reconciliation and many customers now do not ask for the slip as it is no longer required,” said Moghe. On the agenda are bring-your-own-device (BYOD) solutions that will enable the use of regular smartphones with an attachment for accepting cards.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/axis-bank-is-2nd-largest-in-pos-machines/articleshow/88531087.cms

Downside risks are growing, but it’s too early to quantify, they said.But there is a broad consensus that the impact of this wave will be mild.

According to RBI data, ICICI Bank had a market share of 19.6% in August 2020 up from 15.8% in August 2020. SBI Card’s market share in spends, slipped to 18.7% in August 2021 from 20% in the previous year.In absolute terms, total spending through credit cards in August 2021 was Rs 77,733 crore, up 54% from Rs 50,319 crore in August 2020. The overall number of cards in force has increased from 5.8 crore to 6.4 crore in the same period. “Looking at total spends, since November 2020, ICICI has gained around 510 basis points market share, while HDFC Bank and SBI cards have lost around 285bps and 90bps market share, respectively. ICICI Bank’s total spends for July 2021 was equal to that of SBI cards despite ICICI Bank’s market share (based on outstanding cards) being lower than that of SBI Cards. We believe, ICICI’s co-branded card with Amazon (1.6 millon as of March 2021), which forms more than 50% of incremental card additions, has helped it to scale up its credit card business in a significant way,” said Suresh Ganapathy, an analyst with Macquarie research.To boost credit card spending, HDFC Bank on Tuesday launched its Festive Treats 3.0 campaign, which will provide offers on cards, loans and EMIs. The bank has partnered with over 10,000 merchants across 100 locations as it expects customers to return to offline shopping following a dip in Covid cases and increased pace of vaccinations. “This year we have come out with more offline offers including hyperlocal merchants. We will use our ATM platform to inform customers about the offers around their location,” said Parag Rao, group head (payments, consumer finance, digital banking and IT).HDFC Bank continues to be the market leader with 26.5% of total credit card spending in India. However, the bank’s share has fallen from August 2021, when it accounted for 28.7% of the total spend. Sequentially, HDFC Bank had seen a dip in credit cards in force as the RBI ban was still in force for most of the month. Since the ban was lifted the bank had added four lakh credit cards to its base of 1.47 crore cards as of August 2021. The biggest loser in terms of share of spending is Citibank, which led the ranking in terms of card spend for many years. The multinational, which had a 7.8% share of spends in 2020 now accounts for 4.9% of spending. IDFC First Bank, a relatively late entrant, has managed to make a dent by increasing its share of card spend to over 1%. American Express is the only multinational bank to grow its share of spending from a year-ago period. However, the US issuer also faces an embargo on issuing new cards until it complies with data localization norms, which is likely to hit growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-2nd-in-card-spends-ahead-of-sbi/articleshow/86793488.cms

Uncertainty is declining and demand is improving as businesses seek to bolster growth after Covid-19, Arvind Kapil, the bank’s country head for retail assets, said in an interview. It’s an opportunity to reverse the declining share of loans to this segment of the market that was needed to preserve asset quality, he said.“We are planning to double our retail assets book in a focused manner,” Kapil said. “I can sense a robust demand at ground level. I run businesses and I am giving you a feel of what I see.”Of the bank’s total 11.5 trillion rupees ($156 billion) loan book, Kapil is in charge of retail borrowing worth 3.7 trillion rupees, which is expected to reach almost 8 trillion rupees within the next two years. Changing mixIf successful, that would mark a sharp turnaround from its strategy a year ago when the bank slowed down its retail lending to protect its asset quality as the pandemic led to millions of job losses and businesses closures. HDFC Bank’s retail lending share as portion of its total fell to 47% in March, the lowest in at least five years from an average of 54% to 55% previously. The bank, which is also the nation’s most valuable, has the lowest bad-loan ratio among peers, and now wants to focus on unsecured loans for salaried workers, vehicle loans and government business. 86389235“We are taking a pretty aggressive positioning to grow our retail loan book,” Kapil said. “We want to accelerate on segments where we can maintain the asset quality and offer the best return on assets.”Sour pileThe Mumbai-based lender’s retail loans grew around 9.3% slower than its overall book’s 14.4% in the June quarter. That’s sharply lower than its peers like State Bank of India’s 16.5% and ICICI Bank’s 20% growth in that portfolio. Still, the lenders also saw a spike in bad loans in retail lending in the June quarter after an unexpected and more deadly new wave of the virus ripped through India. Since then, loan collections have improved and, for HDFC Bank, are back to pre-pandemic levels, Kapil said. 86389250 “The results of doubling our business will be more visible early next financial year,” he said. “We will balance our top-line growth with our return on assets objective.”--With assistance from Anirban Nag.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-plots-path-to-double-retail-loans/articleshow/86388473.cms

The overall tax expenses reduced by over two-thirds to Rs 1,014 crore, which helped the bottomline.The bank has received a few applications for restructuring from borrowers across segments, he said, adding that it is still early days as the window is open till December 31.It said over Rs 1,400 crore of loans could have slipped into non performing advances (NPAs) during the quarter, but for the Supreme Court mandate not to classify accounts up to August 31 as NPAs.

The bank said that it will issue three lakh cards a month — its monthly run rate before the ban — for the next two to three quarters, following which it will scale up to five lakh cards a month.Outlining the plans, the bank’s group head for payments & consumer finance, digital banking and IT, Parag Rao, said, “In the next three to four quarters, we will regain all our lost market share. The bank has lost close to 2% as rivals like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI Card swooped in to fill the demand.According to Rao, the fourpronged strategy would be to tweak the products, sell more cards to its six-crore customer base, add more partners like fintech companies, telecom, hospitality and pharma companies. It has also revamped the digital process to allow more do-it-yourself features to customers on the bank’s app.Rao said that despite the embargo from the RBI, the bank managed to scale up spend volumes by 60% year-on-year during the first quarter. “Our card spend is on an average one and a half times that of the industry,” said Rao. He said in the eight months the bank has been busy analysing industry trends and customer behaviour and now planned to put them to work.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-will-issue-3-lakh-cards-a-month-regain-lost-ground/articleshow/85581510.cms

The ban on launch of new digital offerings will continue for now. The RBI has also asked the bank’s board to certify compliance of commitments made by HDFC Bank.According to sources, the bank received the notice regarding the ban late on Tuesday and is expected to intimate the same to the bourses. Although the announcement came late for Indian markets, the HDFC Bank American depositary receipts (ADRs) were up by nearly 1% in the US stock exchanges at 9pm IST. The bank had earlier said that it was in a state of readiness to issue cards as soon as the ban was lifted.The relaxation comes just in time for HDFC Bank as a large chunk of credit card spending happens during the festive season from September to December. Retailers also announce special offers during this period to boost sales. HDFC Bank had lost over 1% market share in business following the ban, but still accounts for nearly a fourth of credit card transactions. SBI Card, ICICI Bank and Axis bank had made headway in this period. 85421849In an interaction with the media last month, Parag Rao, a senior executive at HDFC Bank, said that the bank largely issued cards to customers who had an account with it. As against five crore customers, the bank has issued 1.5 crore credit cards. He said that while the gap would remain because of the bank’s credit policy, there has been a big jump in the customer base, creating a pent-up demand.The RBI had imposed a ban on HDFC Bank after repeated outages on its internet banking and mobile banking platforms. Since then, the bank informed shareholders that it has taken special initiatives for scaling up infrastructure, disaster recovery and enhancing security. In his interaction, Rao said that the bank has used the period since the ban to reinforce salesforce and other channels. “We have used the time to de-bottleneck our processes, quicken our software updates, identify points of failures with partners and put a framework to replace systems before there are any issues.” In addition to the immediate fixes under the short-term plan, the bank has also submitted to the RBI a medium-term plan where it will completely rework its digital platform that will enable the bank to manage future growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-can-issue-credit-cards/articleshow/85415506.cms

He had attempted to loot cash and valuables worth over Rs 3 cror from ICICI Bank, where he was earlier employed, on Thursday. The bank is in Manvelpada, outside Virar railway station. He killed deputy manager Yogita Vartak (34) and injured the cashier, Shraddha Devrukhkar (32), when they tried to foil the robbery. He got caught by passers-by while trying to flee after Devrukhkar activated the security alarm and called for help.Police said Dubey had failed to report to work around a week before the attempted heist on Thursday, after misappropriation of funds came to light during an audit.An explanation on missing funds was sought from Dubey by the bank. After Thursday’s incident, the bank sacked him and filed a case with Valiv police. Dubey had joined the Naigaon bank in August last year. Before that he worked with ICICI Virar branch for around 18 months.Police said they will seek his custody for interrogation on misappropriated funds.

Although there has been an increase in retail delinquencies in the first quarter, lenders have not seized or auctioned assets because of the pandemic. With the economy now opening up, recovery action is likely to pick up.“We did postpone quite a bit of normal collection activity. This includes auctions that we might have done of collaterals that we normally can quickly do and collect. We have not done any asset sales or any restructuring in the last quarter,” said HDB Financial Services MD & CEO G Ramesh in an analyst call for HDFC Bank. He added that there has been an improvement since the end of June and early July as customers like to come back on track.84911407“In the jewel loan portfolio, if the loan goes overdue, you send auction notices to customers. In the current environment, we have not done that in April and May and a large part of June as well,” said ICICI Bank chief finance officer Rakesh Jha in an analyst call. He added that the bank has now started doing that in July and has already started to see recoveries from these portfolios.According to RBI data, loans against jewellery by banks stood at Rs 62,221 crore as of June 18, 2021 — an 80% increase over the previous year. Even in the first quarter, loans grew 2.5% despite the second wave. Auto loans had shown a jump of 11% year-on-year at Rs 2,38,214 crore. Last week, another private lender Bajaj Finance said that there was an increase in auto loan delinquencies due to defaults in its three-wheeler loan portfolio. The company’s MD Rajeev Jain said that since the assets were repossessable, the lender might see better recoveries. Fitch Ratings said the second wave of Covid will continue to exert near-term pressure on non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). “Non-performing loans (NPLs) are likely to rise, as renewed activity restrictions have impaired borrower repayment capacity. Collection shortfalls are better than a year ago, but remain significant — 5-40% across various lending segments in April and May 2021,” the rating agency said.Bankers said that while the pandemic impact has been severe, there have not been many defaults in the corporate segment. The SME segment was protected because of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), which had a one-year moratorium that ends in the second quarter. As a result, most of the defaults were being seen in the retail segment.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-jewellery-auto-auctions-to-rise/articleshow/84906408.cms

The bank has launched an ICICI stack for corporates that allows all stakeholders of a company — suppliers, distributors, and promoters — to directly plug into the bank through APIs (application programme interfaces). This allows more self-service options, faster money movement and automates reconciliation.For ICICI Bank, this ‘ecosystem banking’ will allow extending banking services to the corporate’s stakeholders and solve the problem of delayed payments by providing short-term credit.The bank’s stack for corporates is a set of digital banking services designed for 15 industries that can be further tailored for individual companies within an industry. “Customers can use the API to integrate with their ERP system. They will also have an option to deal with us in a physical channel. All the teams within ICICI Bank who are required to cater to the ecosystem will be housed in the ecosystem branches,” said ICICI Bank ED Vishakha Mulye.The digital services that will be provided to corporates include an API-based digital account-opening service, which is a first in the industry. This will also help the bank in gaining more salary accounts.The stack also provides an electronic bank guarantee (e-BG) that acts as an electronic repository of authenticated BG, with an inbuilt tracking mechanism for the corporates. This would be made possible with automated stamping (AeS), which eliminates the need for physical stamp paper from branches for bank guarantees.The corporate will have access to a suite of API-based payments and collection solutions that directly integrate with its ERP system. The other digital products include end-to-end digitisation of inland trade and iValidate, an API-based real-time reconciliation system of collecting funds from multiple parties.According to Mulye, besides getting new customers, the bank would be in a better position to monitor credit quality due to all the information that it has access to. She added that during the lockdown, the working capital cycle has got extended for industries such as steel because of delayed payments. The stack will enable the bank to provide credit to customers and speed up payments to corporates.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-offers-it-stack-to-corporates-to-draw-new-customers/articleshow/83586977.cms

This is almost 30% of the total FASTags issued by 32 banks in the country,” said Paytm Payments Bank chief business officer Sajal Bhatnagar.On Saturday, ICICI Bank executive director Sandeep Batra said that the bank has acquired market leadership in FASTag with 36% of the value of toll collections in FY21. “Our FASTag numbers during the first quarter have seen 146% growth year-on-year,” said Batra.Toll collection is a remunerative business for banks as the issuer bank gets a 1.5% commission on the transactions. ICICI Bank was one of the early movers to partner with the ministry of road transport and highways in its pilot project for electronic toll collections in 2014. Paytm has been able to ramp up the numbers because of its large user base. The big advantage Paytm has is that the primary e-wallet can be the FASTag wallet. This means that the user does not have to block his funds in an idle FASTag-only wallet. According to Bhatnagar, Paytm has an advantage over other issuers as customers can dip into their regular e-wallets for making toll payments. In most e-wallets, the money is locked in a separate wallet. Paytm is also working with the National Highway Authority of India toll concessionaires to implement multi-lane free-flow tolling using automatic number plate-recognition technology. This will make toll collections more efficient.Despite issuing a large volume of FASTags, ICICI Bank can generate higher value as heavy commercial vehicles account for the bulk of road toll payments. According to government data, toll collection in June 2021 increased to Rs 2,576 crore, which is around 21% higher than Rs 2,125 crore collected in May 2021. It is not just FASTag issuance that banks are competing for. Banks are also in a race to acquire as many highway toll concession holders as possible.

Now, nearly a third of corporates do business with the largest lender and 30 per cent name it as their cash management provider.""Several trends have contributed to the pick-up in market penetration among the leading banks, including the 'mega merger' of the country's public sector banks and the Reserve Bank of India's 'circular on current accounts', which essentially rules that banks can only open current accounts for companies to whom they are also major credit providers,” the report said.It said the pressures exerted by the pandemic will accelerate the consolidation of the Indian corporate banking industry, as the market's biggest banks prove themselves best-positioned to help large- and middle-market companies overcome crisis disruptions.""When the pandemic sent the country into lockdown last year, companies needed immediate assistance from banks, at first to ensure financial stability, and then to keep businesses running,"" says Gaurav Arora, head of Asia at Coalition Greenwich, part of Crisil, said.The 2021 'Coalition Greenwich' research study mentioned State Bank of India, along with leading private sector banks Axis Bank and HDFC Bank, and foreign banks Citi and HSBC, as companies' top sources of support during the crisis.The report said that even before the start of the global pandemic, India's corporate banking market was on a consolidation path, driven by decisive steps by regulators to solidify the country's banking sector, and the rapid evolution and growth of the leading private banks.

It then sanctioned Rs 25 crore as the first disbursement and took Rs 15.5 crore as processing fee and service tax. He got Rs 9.5 crore. Later disbursements stopped, but the bank continued charging interest.Vishal Sharma, 48, director of Hotel Horizon Pvt Ltd, has named several officials of the bank, the ARC firm and others. The FIR, filed at the BKC police station, has been transferred to the economic offences wing. Niket Kaushik, EOW chief, said: “Facts are being disputed by both parties. Our probe is on.”In 2011, Sharma sought the Rs 351-crore loan to build a luxury hotel in Juhu. “The complainant said the bank deducted Rs 15.5 crore from the first disbursement of Rs 25 crore in the first quarter and the remaining Rs 9.5 crore was deposited in the loan account in the second quarter,” said a police officer. Sharma told the police the bank declared the processing fee as profit in its audit report.“The complainant said he wanted Rs 65 crore as first disbursement. However, the bank’s management team gave false information that Rs 25 crore was needed for construction and approved it,” said an officer.Sharma has also alleged that some management committee members inserted false terms in a revised loan agreement and his company’s assets worth Rs 1,200 crore were mortgaged. Sharma paid interest for a year and stopped since he did not get the second disbursement in 2013. The bank declared the loan an NPA in 2016, said police.“The complainant told the police that members of the management team submitted a false proposal to the credit committee, saying his firm was ready to pay the full outstanding of Rs 47 crore. The bank sold the loan to an ARC. The complainant said a burden of Rs 120 crore (interest) has been placed on his mortgaged assets worth Rs 1,200 crore while they got only Rs 9.5 crore loan. He further alleged that the accused conspired to mislead the company by submitting false proposals to the credit committee without informing the company. We are probing,” said an officer.An ICICI Bank spokesperson said: “The company is a defaulter. The previous complaints by the company were rejected not only by the EOW, but also by the banking ombudsman.

You will rapidly see HDFC Bank not just regaining market share but also significantly increasing our spend market share,"" Rao said.Without sharing any details over when he expects the ban to be lifted, Rao said within 3-4 months of the ban getting lifted, one should expect a correction in the incremental market share back to the pre-ban levels, launch of new products and features and also partnerships which have been forged during this period.""We were very clear that this is at best a temporal situation. During the six months when we were not issuing new credit cards, we increased our merchant acceptance base, our liability franchise increased and today we are sitting on a large base of already analytically data mined customers who have already kept ready and pre-approved,"" he said.The ""large sales force"" has been trained, re-skilled and primed for the aggressive play ahead and backend processes for them have also been made more streamlined, Rao said.He admitted that rivals have seized up on the opportunity once HDFC Bank stopped issuing the cards, amidst reports on how ICICI Bank and SBI, among others have grown. It can be noted that HDFC Bank's credit card customers decreased by 4.67 lakh between December and April, when they stood at 14.9 million, while SBI has gained over 6 lakh new cards and ICICI gained 10 lakh.The bank has been in constant discussion with RBI ever since the ban was imposed and has upgraded its systems as per the indications from the regulator, Rao said, adding that it has now presented a plan which focuses on the immediate, short term, mid-term and long term plan to the central bank.""We are awaiting the comments from the RBI. We are hopeful that RBI will be satisfied with the plan which we had submitted,"" he said.Rao said the bank's investments in technology were already at par with global standards, but the recent regulatory action will see higher spends on technology over the next two or three years.Reiterating its focus outlined earlier, he said outages do happen and they happen with rivals as well, but the important aspect will be how it manages its way out of a crisis.The bank's shares were trading 0.17 per cent down at Rs 1,499 apiece on the BSE at 1344 hrs, as against gains of 0.28 per cent on the benchmark.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-ban-on-new-credit-cards-sale-hit-market-share-will-come-back-with-a-bang-once-embargo-lifted-hdfc-bank/articleshow/83983015.cms

The digital ecosystem has also worked in India’s favour, which is also resulting in MNCs choosing India over other Asian countries. When you have digital ecosystem, tracking and governance also improve,” said Vishakha Mulye, executive director, ICICI Bank.She said that this is in keeping with the bank’s strategy to keep the focus of ICICI Bank’s global business India-centric. “We have relations with over 1,500 MNCs in the country and the number will only grow. The platform will not only help new clients but also benefit existing ones to do business in India,” she said.

This is a","MUMBAI: The banking sector has recorded its highest ever profits of Rs 1,02,252 crore in FY21, a year when the economy was battered by the pandemic. This is a significant turnaround compared to a net loss of nearly Rs 5,000 crore for the industry in FY19.Two banks — HDFC Bank and SBI — contributed half of the industry’s profits. Of the total profits, HDFC Bank at Rs 31,116 crore accounted for 30%, an 18% increase over the previous year. The country’s largest lender SBI accounted for another 20% at Rs 20,410 crore. The third-highest was ICICI Bank, which earned Rs 16,192 crore, more than double what it earned in the previous year. Private banks also gained market share as public sector banks (PSBs) went slow in lending.The biggest turnaround was among PSBs which reported a collective net profit for the first time in five years. Only two of the 12 PSU banks — Punjab & Sind Bank and Central Bank of India — reported a net loss for the year.  83864807In the private sector, Yes Bank remained in the red with a net loss of Rs 3,462 crore as it continued to make provisions. However, for banks in the red, the losses were lesser than what they reported in the previous year.The single biggest reason for PSBs to post such a Rs 57,832-crore turnaround — from a loss of Rs 26,015 crore in FY20 to a combined profit of Rs 31,817 crore — was the end of their legacy bad loan problem. This burden reached a peak after the RBI forced banks to classify 12 large defaulting accounts, followed by another 40 accounts, as non-performing assets and initiate bankruptcy proceedings. Given the size of these exposures, the move resulted in loans worth Rs 4 lakh crore turning bad. By March 2020, banks had completed making provisions for most of these loans. Additional provisions were offset by large recoveries from earlier written-off accounts, and banks stopped bleeding.According to rating agency ICRA, the profits for the current year were the windfall gains on bond portfolios of public banks account, which contributed two-thirds of their profits before tax in FY21. The rating agency added that barring SBI, profit from the sale of bonds exceeded the pre-tax profits of all other public banks. The profit from bond sales was higher than the Rs 20,000-crore capital infused by the government in FY21.The value of government bonds rises when interest rates fall. The RBI’s aggressive move to keep rates low has reduced interest income but provided huge gains in treasury income. The year 2020-21 was also a year of consolidation for the 10 public sector banks that merged into four. Last year, the merging entities recorded huge losses in the fourth quarter before the merger, which contributed to the Rs 26,015-crore loss among PSU banks in FY20. This year, the acquiring banks made profits with Indian Bank topping the list at Rs 3,004 crore followed by Union Bank at Rs 2,905 crore.The impact of the pandemic is not yet reflected in the balance sheets of the banks as lenders have been allowed to restructure loans of defaulters. In the second wave, the RBI allowed banks to give stressed borrowers one more year to repay. Given that large corporate accounts are not affected, banks do not expect defaults on account of the pandemic to trigger losses in future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-covid-year-banks-see-record-profit-of-rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/83854704.cms

Amidst growing tension between India and China, People's Bank of China pared some of its stake in HDFC Ltd during April-June quarter.The central bank brought down its investment below 1 per cent. As a result, its name was dropped from the list of investors holding at least 1 per cent stake in the company as of June-end.Central banks typically make investments in various asset classes including gold, foreign currencies and also bonds, including both government and corporate ones.During the QIP of ICICI Bank last week, the government of Singapore picked up 4.6 crore shares, representing 11.06 per cent of the total size on offer. Other prominent investors included Morgan Stanley Investment Funds Global Opportunity Fund and Societe Generale-ODI picking up 7.31 per cent and 5.55 per cent, respectively.As per the QIP objective, the proceeds of the issue will be used towards strengthening the capital adequacy ratio of the bank, improving the bank's competitive positioning and/ or general corporate requirements or any other purposes as may be permissible under the applicable law.Taking a strong view of the development, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) criticised ICICI Bank for allowing People's Bank of China to invest in the bank despite strong sentiments prevailing in the country against the world's populous nation.CAIT said that this is the second such instance of a Chinese bank trying to make inroads into the Indian financial system after the China's central bank earlier this year made an investment in HDFC Ltd.The traders body asked the finance minister to direct both ICICI Bank and HDFC Ltd to return the investments by the Chinese entity.CAIT has urged the finance minister to take immediate cognizance of this entire matter and devise a policy framework to thwart China's plans and protect the sovereignty of the banking system as also advising the RBI to take necessary steps immediately.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/peoples-bank-of-china-picks-up-0-006-stake-in-icici-bank-through-qip/articleshow/77611783.cms

Of this, Rs 58 lakh was saved in Delhi and Rs 53 lakh in Rajasthan. The National Helpline and its reporting mechanism – which enables persons cheated in cyber frauds to report such cases and prevent loss of their hard earned money – was operationalised by I4C with the active support and cooperation of RBI, all major banks, payment banks, wallets and online merchants. The Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System was developed in-house by I4C to integrate law enforcement agencies with banks and financial intermediaries.The home ministry on Thursday said the reporting mechanism is currently being utilized, along with 155260 helpline, by seven states and Union territories – Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh – and covers more than 35% of the country’s population. “Roll-out in the other states...is underway to prevent the flow of money siphoned off by fraudsters,” noted a statement put out by MHA.The facility empowers both the banks and the police by leveraging new-age technologies for sharing online fraud-related information and taking action in almost real-time. The loss of defrauded money in online cheating cases can be stopped by chasing the money trail and stopping its further flow, thus preventing the fraudster from taking it out of the digital ecosystem.Victims of cyber fraud only need to call on the helpline, which is manned and operated by the concerned State police. The police operator notes down the fraud transaction details and basic personal information of the caller and submits them in the form of a ticket on the Citizen Financial Cyber Frauds Reporting and Management System. The ticket gets escalated to the concerned banks, wallets, merchants and so on. An SMS is sent to the victim with an acknowledgement number, with which full details of the fraud can be submitted on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal .The concerned bank, which can now see the ticket on its dashboard on the reporting portal, checks the details in its internal systems. If the defrauded money is still available, the bank puts it on hold, disabling the fraudster from withdrawing it. If the defrauded money has moved out to another bank, the ticket gets escalated to the next bank. This process goes on until the money is saved from reaching the hands of the fraudsters.Currently, the helpline and its reporting platform has all the major public and private sector banks on board, including SBI, PNB, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, etc.. It also has all major wallets and merchants such as PayTM, PhonePe, Mobikwik, Flipkart and Amazon integrated with it.

A loan restructuring, for which a meeting of lenders will be convened over the next few days, will provide relief to the promoters led by the Gaur family, which has lost Jaypee Infratech, its crown jewel that had a massive land bank, running from Noida to Agra along expressways. The proposal has been on the table for months but so far the lenders have failed to make much headway.83560595 Even as lenders deliberate are structuring, the company’s stock has been on fire in recent days, surging almost 70% from Rs 8.86 on May 31 to nearly Rs 15, when it again hit the upper circuit on the BSE. Volumes too have shot up, creating fresh surprise in the market. While the exchanges had sought an explanation for the recent rise, JAL said it had been making the requisite disclosures and was not aware of any reasons. While the buzz around a loan restructuring — which will need a clearance from RBI — is one of the triggers, a possible conversion of an FCCB is said to be the other reason for the rise. A higher price will again be beneficial to the promoters, who owned nearly 38.5% in the company. JAL was among the second batch of two dozen companies referred by the RBI for insolvency resolution in 2017. While several cases have been resolved, JAL has been slow off the blocks. Banking sources, however, said that pushing through a restructuring, despite backroom manoeuvres by at least one of the top lenders in the country, may not be easy. To begin with, the restructuring attempts from lenders led by ICICI Bank comes despite Bank of Maharashtra seeking to declare the company, along with its promoters and directors, as wilful defaulters —a tag that will deny them access to fresh funding from the banking system. Besides, there has to be a rating from one of the agencies suggesting that the exercise will be sustainable for the account that turned into a non-performing asset several quarters ago. Further, the RBI will have to reverse its own position after having identified JAL as one of the cases where lenders were asked to push for bankruptcy action, including removal of the current management as the first step. Apart from being the majority owner of Jaiprakash Associates, a title that it has lost, JAL has assets in the cement and power sectors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jal-lenders-make-fresh-loan-recast-bid/articleshow/83560564.cms

He told the ED that he would sign documents on instructions from Deepak without knowing the content.Dhoot in his statement to the ED said that it would have been detrimental to his interests if he had not agreed to it. Videocon group invested Rs 64 crore ino NuPower Renewable Pvt Ltd (NRPL), a company controlled by Deepak.The ED alleged that Chanda misused her position in the bank to sanction a loan to Videocon group after violating rules and received kickbacks in the form of investments in her husband’s company, Nu-Power. The ED submitted the chargesheet against Kochhars and Dhoot before a special court on November 4 and annexed these statements to it.Dhoot told ED that Deepak asked him to invest in his company and insisted that he meet Chanda, who was then heading the ICICI Bank. Officials said that Chanda told Dhoot to “take care of her husband’s interest by putting money in his company”. Dhoot claimed it was because of this that he transferred Rs 64 crore of the Rs 300 crore loan disbursed to his group company by the ICICI Bank.The ICICI Bank in all had sanctioned Rs 5,393 crore loan to Videocon group companies in different tranches during the tenure of Chanda, of which the principal amount of Rs 2,812 crore turned bad. The collateral kept with the bank was not in proportion to the loan sanctioned, said the ED. The ED alleged that the loan to NuPower was not intended to be returned to Videocon, because a group company, Real Cleantech Pvt Ltd, which was created for holding the proceeds of crime, was allowed a silent death. The company was struck off in 2018, to break the link of returning the NuPower loan money to Videocon group, said ED.The Videocon group initiated the process to revive Real Cleantech after the ED started to investigate the money laundering case against it in 2019, all to show that money diverted to NuPower was a legitimate investment and returned to the Videocon group.Deepak has been controlling NuPower since its formation in 2008, through PCSPL, which was formed in 1999.

We can’t withdraw restrictions everywhere simultaneously because we have to save lives,” he added.Instead of going for a total lockdown, Assam had imposed strict restrictions mainly to provide relief to the daily wage earners. “Assam is the only state which has fought the second wave of Covid-19 without total lockdown. The Covid situation would have improved further had there been a toal lockdown in the state. But we kept in mind the livelihood options of the people and tried to fight with Covid in a balanced way,” Sarma said.The CM added that Silchar town will be a focussed area of vaccination drive because of the higher number of positive cases there. “The health department is trying to finish administering the first dose in Nagaon, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Tezpur in the next 10 days,” Sarma said. Sarma was hopeful that the Covid statistics would get better as these towns have mostly contributed to the total number of positive cases of late.“In Guwahati city, the vaccination has touched the six-lakh mark. Within 10 days, our target is to touch eight lakh vaccinations,” he added.Sarma said there would be no let-up on the part of the Assam government as far as third wave speculations are concerned. “To get prepared to deal with the third wave, we are planning to complete 1,000 paediatrics ICUs soon,” he added.Coinciding with the 30-days completion of the state government, Sarma dedicated the Covid Care Hospital at Sarusajai to the service of the people in the presence of health minister Keshab Mahanta.The new hospital with a project cost of Rs 21.46 crores will function as an annexe to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). Oil India Limited and ICICI Bank have extended financial support to the tune of Rs 2 crore and Rs 1.5 crore respectively for accomplishment of the project. He also thanked the DRDO for setting up the hospital within a record period of around 20 days and for having been a generous partner in this critical project and termed it as a fine example of Centre-state collaboration.Stating that the hospital will have a life span of five years, which can be further extended with minimum infrastructure boost up, Sarma said there will be 100 ICU beds available in the hospital and oxygen facility could also be made available in another 200 beds. Moreover, liquid oxygen tank has been set up to provide a continuous supply of oxygen to patients which will be refilled weekly.The CM further added that from now on, treatment of Covid patients will be gradually reduced at MMCH and Singimari hospital and patients will be taken care of at GMCH and the Covid Care Hospital at Sarusajai.The CM said that during the last 30 days, 465 ICU beds, including beds with ventilation facility, and 2684 oxygen-supported beds were added in the medical institutions. Moreover, 200 ICU beds at the GMCH will be made functional in the next ten days, he informed, adding that the government is working to set up at least 15 ICU beds in every district hospital.Commemorating the day, Sarma also inaugurated a 20-bed ICU and 32 oxygen-supported beds at the Kalapahar Covid Care Hospital in the city.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-to-ease-covid-curbs-from-june-15-himanta-biswa-sarma/articleshow/83409135.cms

We are cooperating with Hyderabad Police. Besides technical help, the STF is also probing the leads,” an officer said.According to the complaint, on April 21, a man approached the private bank branch in Alipore with a fake letter saying that the office-in-charge, cyber cell police, Lalbazar, has directed the bank to defreeze 12 accounts and transfer the amount to an SBI account. “The fraudster also showed a fake police ID card and the bank officials transferred around Rs 1.2 crore to the SBI account,” cyber crime ACP KVM Prasad said.“From the SBI account, the money was transferred to multiple accounts and withdrawn immediately,” he added. Police sources said around Rs 1.2 crore was initially transferred to an SBI account of Anand J in RGI Airport SBI branch. “The details of the account holder are all fake,” police said.A Kolkata Police officer said: “We are also investigating how the accused had first called up the branch manager, threatened him with police summons and then came down to the bank to force him to unlock the frozen accounts.”The fraudsters also sent a fake letter in the name of Hyderabad cyber crime police to Udyog Vihar branch of ICICI bank in Gurgaon in the third week of April, asking them to unfreeze 39 accounts linked to a loan app fraud case registered in Hyderabad.“In the letter, instructions were given to transfer the amount from frozen accounts to four accounts. But the bank officials alerted their Hyderabad office,” the ACP said. Bank officials verified with police and realised that the letter was fake and during the inquiry found out about the fraud at Kolkata.“We have registered a case pertaining to the fake Hyderabad Police letter received by the ICICI bank in Gurgaon. The bank filed a separate complaint in Kolkata about the fraud committed in Alipore,” Hyderabad cyber crime inspector D Prashant said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rs-1-2cr-stolen-from-pvt-bank-in-multi-city-fraud/articleshow/83155113.cms

The bank will be using imagery sent by Earth observation satellites to measure an array of parameters related to the land, irrigation and crop patterns. The data, thus collected will be combined with demographic and financial parameters to make speedy lending decisions for farmers. ICICI Bank will be the first bank in the country and among few globally to use this technology to help farmers get better access to credit. The technology will help farmers, who are existing customers of the Bank as well as non-customers, to avail Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans. The bank has started using satellite data in over 500 villages in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and plans to cover nearly 63,000 villages across the country.In a statement, the bank said that this will reduce the time taken to assess a farmer’s credit to a few days as compared to the industry practice of 15 days. This considering the fact that land verification is done in a contactless manner. Use of innovative technology will help farmers with existing credit to enhance their eligibility, while new-to-credit farmers can now get better access to credit.  Key satellite data being used by the ICICI Bank include rainfall and temperature data of past years, soil moisture levels in past years, surface water availability, trends in crop sowing including crop name, tentative sowing & harvesting weeks and crop health and yields. It is also assessing agriculture land location details including latitude, longitude and boundary of the land and nearby locations of warehouses and mandis ICICI Bank has also partnered with agri–fintech companies specialising in harnessing space technology and weather information for commercial usage.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/icici-bank-announces-use-of-satellite-data-to-assess-credit-worthiness-of-farmers/articleshow/77738798.cms

Chaturvedi had joined the Hyderabad-headquartered business house in December 2019. He resigned from his executive role in January this year and is currently on the boards of three of the Karvy group companies as non-executive director.Chaturvedi's resignation letter, submitted by Karvy Stock Broking (KSBL) to the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Hyderabad, is dated January 14, 2021. “I hereby submit my resignation from the post of Chief Executive Officer-Financial Services businesses and Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) of the company, in terms of the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, and the rules issued thereunder, with effect from January 14, 2021,” Chaturvedi said in his resignation letter addressed to the board of directors of KSBL.Sources said that while he has resigned from the post of CEO & KMP in the financial services businesses, he has been asked to continue on the boards of three Karvy group entities, in a non-executive role.He is on the boards of Karvy Capital, the group’s asset management arm, Karvy Financial Services, the NBFC focused on providing financial support to MSMEs and Karvy Investor Services, the entity that offers investment banking and advisory services.Chaturvedi did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. At the same time, C Parthasarathy, chairman, Karvy Group denied that Chaturvedi had quit. “No, he has not resigned from the services of the company. He has stepped down as KMP. He continues to be in the employment of the company as head of the financial services business and a CEO, not being a KMP,” Parthasarathy said. He also denied that Chaturvedi was serving his notice period at the group.Chaturvedi’s appointment was announced by Karvy Group on December 31, 2019, as part of a corporate restructuring exercise ostensibly aimed at cleaning up the house after the demat account scam by KSBL came to light in late November 2019.The rejig came a little over a month after stock market regulator Sebi banned Karvy Group flagship KSBL for pledging securities of its clients with lenders without permission from those very clients, to raise funds. This was a violation of the then newly introduced Sebi rules that had kicked in on October 1, 2019.KSBL had pledged securities of around 95,000 clients to raise over Rs 2,300 crore from various banks and financial institutions including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance, Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank.Chaturvedi was brought in to clean up the mess at the group’s financial services operations. Before joining Karvy, Chaturvedi, over a span of three decades, had worked with Essel Group, Dhanalakshmi Bank, Reliance (now Nippon) Mutual Fund and ICICI Bank.To come out of the bad phase, Karvy had plans to sell off some of its assets to generate funds to pay off its loans, release the pledged shares and pay back the same to KSBL’s clients. As part of this plan, it sold off its minority stake in Karvy Fintech, one of the leading register & transfer agents for the mutual fund industry. The company has since been renamed KFin Tech and is now majority-owned by global PE player General Atlantic.However, Karvy’s plans to monetise other assets failed and as a result to recover part of its dues, all the demat and trading accounts of KSBL’s customers were auctioned off to IIFL Securities and Axis Securities.

This was done under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) announced by the government in the wake of Covid. Another segment where banks have been aggressive is home loans, which saw unexpected demand in the fourth quarter despite the pandemic.Kotak Mahindra Bank said during its earnings call that it has reduced its unsecured portfolio to 5.8% of the loan book in FY21 from 7.5% earlier. Given that the bank had hardly grown its loan book during the year, it meant that the lender had shrunk its unsecured book. ICICI Bank too has been cautious in this segment of individual loans. While the bank grew its home loans by 21% year on year, its loan book grew in single digits. The bank also brought down its loan against shares and other securities by 8%. Incidentally, lenders consider two-wheeler loans to be part of their unsecured portfolio as both recovery costs and depreciation are high. ICICI Bank shrunk its two-wheeler loans by 4%.Axis Bank had been bringing down its share of unsecured loans to small businesses even before the pandemic. As against 19% of small & medium enterprise (SME) loans that were unsecured in FY19, the share came down to 15% in FY20 and 11% in FY21. During its results announcement, Axis Bank said that it shifted focus to secured lending and growing the deposit base.

Why cannot we find a toll number of mail id to file a complaint on delayed cancellation of payments? Why should we rely only raising complaints on Twitter?”On Tuesday, Sharma faced a two-hour delay in the cancellation of sell order on his Dogecoin and has raised seven tickets on the WazirX app, which are unattended so far.Facing a downtime for the second time in a month, WazirX CEO Nishcal Shetty claimed the disruption was a cause of a sudden spike in heavy traffic on its platform. “As more users got on board the site, even the legitimate requests were getting blocked as our AI detected them and incorrectly marked this as a threat. Need of the hour is to onboard more coders and not add more servers.” In the case of Doge-INR trade, the exchange said it saw almost one lakh users on the site at a time, which is 70% more than our daily average trade. After Bitcoin, Dogecoin’s sudden price movement, on Wednesday, had caused a massive surge in volume of users and transactions on Indian exchanges. Another user Arpit Biyani tweeted he had placed a stop loss order when Doge was Rs 58, the exchange has paused the Doge trading and resumed it at Rs 54. “Who is going to pay for my loss?” On complaints on delay in deposits made to user WazirX wallet, Shetty says, “Banking partners like ICICI Bank have stepped down, so we found replacements (a private bank). However, there are customers who still deposit in the old bank account, which causes the delay.”Another exchange CoinDCX faced criticisms from users who got logged out of their accounts and unable to sign in, besides others who saw incorrect trade rates on the platform.Its co-founder Neeraj Khandelwal, on Wednesday, tweeted, “Due to unprecedented traffic our systems were tested and some key APIs failed. This led to an abnormal activity on our CoinDCX Go App. We were able to recover the systems however we had to put the app under maintenance.” The entire maintenance activity lasted for 18 minutes, Khandelwal said.

In February, the government had said that public sector banks will set up a national ARC which will buy bad loans from banks and help clean their books. Banks had decided to set up their ARC as the valuation of assets turned out to be a roadblock in selling them to existing ARCs.The terms of reference of the panel include a review of the existing legal and regulatory framework applicable to ARCs and to recommend measures to improve the efficacy of ARCs. The panel will also review the role of ARC in the resolution of stressed assets including under the bankruptcy law.

The list includes everything from healthcare, aviation and corporate retail outlets to power, cement, construction and textiles.So borrowers from these sectors with outstanding loans of Rs 50-500 crore can avail of the special facility. 82112272The amendment to the Rs 3 lakh crore ECLGS was announced as more cities went under a fresh lockdown following a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases. Around 80% of the scheme is understood to have been utilized which leaves around Rs 60,000 crore worth of loans available under the scheme that was originally meant for micro, small and medium enterprises that were facing a liquidity crunch.With MSME units not using up the entire limit, the government first extended it to professionals before opening it to the hospitality, travel and tourism sectors, which have been hit hard by Covid-19.Now, the scheme will be available to borrower accounts classified as Special Mention Account (SMA)-0 or SMA-1 as of February 29, 2020. These accounts are those where the overdue period is between 31 to 60 days. Initially, this facility was available to only those who were up to date with their payments.The fresh funding, backed by a government guarantee, can help these borrowers tap loans from banks, and even clear their past dues, enabling businesses to come back on track as the demand situation normalises.The government has said that the scheme would be available to loans sanctioned under the guaranteed emergency credit line during the period from May 23, 2020, to June 30, 2021, or till guarantees for an amount of Rs. 3 lakh crore are issued, whichever is earlier.While some analysts have expressed fears that guaranteeing loans to stressed borrowers would only hide the stress, credit rating agencies say that this is not a credit negative for lenders.“This cannot be termed as evergreening for several reasons. First, the earlier limits of 20% will not be enough to cover the loan repayment for the stress which may continue for a longer period. Second, since the loans are guaranteed by the government the banks are not increasing their credit exposure to the borrower. Third, most of the loans under the scheme have gone to borrowers with standard accounts and since the scheme has further headroom for new sanctions, that is being made available to borrowers in need,” said Anil Gupta, vice president, financial sector ratings ICRA.According to Gupta, this is a pragmatic decision from the macroeconomic standpoint as it will help businesses and save jobs.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/now-even-defaulters-can-borrow-more/articleshow/82109619.cms

These include one where Reliance Industries has tied up with Facebook and Google, another led by Paytm which has companies like Ola, while there is one led by the Tata Group with Mastercard, Bharti Airtel, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank as partners.The extended deadline for making the applications ended on Wednesday.ICICI Bank and Axis Bank will be co-leading the consortium with a 20 per cent stake each, officials in the know told PTI.Other partners, including Amazon, Billdesk, Pine Labs and Visa will be holding a stake of 15 per cent each, they said.The scope of activities for the NUE as mandated by RBI includes payment systems in the retail space like ATMs, white label point of sale terminals, Aadhar-based payment systems and remittance services, operation of clearing and settlement systems for participating banks and non-banks, be interoperable with NPCI, and participate in the Reserve Bank's payment and settlement systems.

Other lenders also have dedicated accounts for the start-ups.When asked about the charges for the account, its Head of Self-employed Segment Pankaj Gadgil told reporters that the bank will waive average quarterly balance requirements on the current accounts for a year.He said July saw 20,000 start-ups being registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which went up in August and the trend has been encouraging in September as well, which made the bank launch the newly designed offering.The bank already serves an undisclosed number of start-ups as part of the earlier offering and other offerings, he said adding that the addressable opportunity is large as 8.5 lakh start-ups have been registered since 2010.New businesses (up to 10 years old), including partnerships, private and public limited companies as well as limited liability partnerships, can opt for current account, the bank said.When asked if the offering, which also includes lending, was driven by the recent change in norms to include loans to start-ups under priority sector lending, he said the bank is working on such a offering for long.The idea is to take care of other aspects of a business and let the start-up focus on the core business, Gadgil said.

He said the key requisite for banks to prepare themselves for a digital future was to ask themselves whether they are banks of technology players.”Kamath said that current technology allows lenders to check the antecedents of intending borrowers in real-time. He said that lenders can use parameters such as whether the borrower can attend office in time to judge the quality of the borrower. They were also able to locate where the borrower currently is.According to Kamath, the next decade would be characterized by the 5Ds – demographics, democracy, dematerialized, digital and disruptive. “The whole financial services space is set for the same level of disruption that we saw 20 years ago,” said Kamath. He said that 20 years back, ICICI Bank was able to disrupt the financial service space by universalizing financial services which it delinked from branches.He said that the next decade would see disruption where the customer would be their own bank, mutual fund, insurance company, and brokerage and transact with multiple service providers in a dematerialized state.“RBI has clearly articulated what is going to happen as we go forward. We are in a happy place where the regulator is ahead of the market.

Just last week, Shunwei Capital sold its 9% stake in Koo.Almost 50% of Finnov’s funding in the last two months has been used to buy out the Chinese investors along with Singapore-based Kunlun, while the rest of the capital was invested into the company as primary capital.

ICICI Bank is the latest to cut home loan rates to 6.7%, which is only about 0.5% higher that the government’s cost of borrowing. But there are hints of upward pressure on interest rate with some banks and NBFCs hiking fixed deposit (FD) rates.Consider this: The spread between home loan rates and government borrowing rates has narrowed to the lowest in history with yields on the 10-year bond rising to 6.23%, which is currently less than 50 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) below the best home loan rate.81359081Of late, yields on bonds have risen globally after the US Federal Reserve chairman said he did not see the need for intervention and inflation could rise as the economy revives. On Friday in India, the yield on the 10-year benchmark rose to 6.26% intraday — nearly an 11-month high. And as the RBI and bond traders are involved in a tug-of-war on yields, in Friday’s weekly bond auction, gilts worth about Rs 19,400 crore of the total Rs 32,000 crore on offer devolved on primary dealers, RBI data showed.Alarmed by the increase in bond yields, Indian Railways Finance Corporation and National Cooperative Development Corporation cancelled bond issues. However, even as bond yields surged, ICICI Bank joined SBI, Kotak and HDFC in cutting home loan rates. The private lender said that it has reduced rates on home loans of up to Rs 75 lakh to 6.7%, and 6.75% for above Rs 75 lakh. “We see resurgence in demand from consumers, who want to buy homes for their own consumption in the past few months,” said ICICI Bank head (secured assets) Ravi Narayanan.Anticipating growing demand for credit, some lenders are offering better returns to depositors. Bajaj Finance is one of the few issuers which have recently tweaked interest rates on FDs. It now offers returns up to 7.25% for senior citizens. HDFC and PNB too have raised deposit rates recently.While an increase in returns is good for senior citizens as well as those saving for their retirement through EPFO, it could hurt equity markets. “Bond markets have started showing nervousness about sharply rising commodity prices, especially crude. The equity rally, which started in April 2020, has broad underlying assumptions of easy liquidity plus large fiscal stimulus without significant uptick in inflation. Rising yields may queer the pitch and trigger a selloff in global equities,” said Quantum Mutual Fund’s fund manager Nilesh Shetty.The positive in the macro fund is on the foreign exchange front. Hitherto, the RBI had been under pressure to buy dollars. “The trade deficit is edging back up to pre-pandemic levels. The resultant shrinkage in the balance of payments surplus in 2021 could mean that the RBI may not have to buy as many dollars, providing it some degrees of freedom as it juggles between its objectives on inflation, the rupee, and bond yields,” said HSBC India chief India economist Pranjul Bhandari.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-spike-in-gilt-yields-fd-rates-inch-up-too/articleshow/81356445.cms

In Monday’s flat market, the Indigo stock on the BSE closed over 1.4% higher at Rs 953.Of late, lenders are in a rush to raise funds from the market.

Subsequently, lenders will need to provide for these and hence the rush among lenders to raise funds as long as the stock market is rallying.In the past few months, several lenders have raised funds.

In three sessions, the sensex has gained 2,345 points and closed the day’s session at 51,445 points.Wednesday’s gains, that built on Tuesday’s 445-point rise, came on the back of reports that India’s services sector in February expanded at its strong pace in a year. The day’s gains also came on the back of a Rs 2,089-crore net buying by foreign funds, BSE data showed. Domestic funds too were on the buying side with a Rs 393-crore net inflow. The Nifty closed 327 points higher at 15,246 points. Of the 30 sensex stocks, only three closed in the red while RIL, HDFC and ICICI Bank together contributed nearly half of the index’s rise on Wednesday.The day’s gains on Dalal Street, however, came despite a sharp selloff in the government bond market with the yield on the 10-year benchmark papers closing at 6.24%, the highest in nearly 11 months. On Wednesday evening, too, the yields on the US treasury bonds rose sharply to about 1.47%, which again unnerved investors globally since a rising yield could mean inflation would also rise, hampering the process of economic recovery.Globally crude prices also rose about 2.5% with Brent rallying above the $61-per-barrel level. Combined with rising yield, higher crude prices pose a strong challenge to the Covid-battered economy, market players said.Despite the emerging fundamental weaknesses, technical analysts are looking at benchmark indices to rally to new life high levels. According to Shrikant Chouhan, EVP — equity technical research, Kotak Securities, the broad support of all sectors in the market clearly shows that it will not be difficult for the Nifty/sensex to cross the previous high of 15,432 points/52,517 points.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-nears-life-high-after-a-1148-point-rally/articleshow/81319512.cms

As a result, foreign investors have also slowed down their buying of stocks in India, official data showed.Since hitting an intraday high of 52,516 points on Tuesday, the sensex has now lost a little over 1,600 points or 3.1%. Investors too are poorer by Rs 1.2 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at nearly Rs 204 lakh crore.Friday’s slide on Dalal Street came on the back of strong selling in most bank stocks. End-of-the-session data showed that ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and SBI contributed the most to the sensex’s slide. Outside of the index, public sector banks — the stocks that had seen one of the most spectacular rallies in recent times since the Budget on February 1 — lost heavily. Among the most sold were Central Bank, which closed at the 10% lower circuit limit, while Bank of India closed with a 9.6% loss.

The scheme involved a government guarantee for additional loans, up to Rs 3 lakh crore, extended to businesses facing stress due to the Covid pandemic.Of the total loans of Rs 1.4 lakh crore extended by banks up to January 25, 2021, HDFC Bank has disbursed Rs 23,504. This is nearly 17% of the loans sanctioned. SBI, with disbursals of Rs 18,700, has a market share of 13.3%. According to banking analysts, this demonstrates HDFC Bank’s capabilities in lending to small businesses.The ECLGS came in two phases. The first ECLGS-1 was for only small businesses and, in the second ECLGS-2 round, it was extended to large industries that were part of the 26 stressed sectors. HDFC Bank’s performance has enabled private sector banks outdo public sector banks (PSBs) in funding for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector.  80780185In response to a query in Lok Sabha, minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur said that the total amount of loans sanctioned and disbursed by the banking sector was just a shade under Rs 2 lakh crore and Rs 1.4 lakh crore, respectively. Of this, the sanctions and disbursements by public sector banks were Rs 83,162 crore and Rs 61,226 crore. In the case of private banks, the sanction and disbursement numbers were Rs 1.15 lakh crore and Rs 80,227 crore.In the public sector, after State Bank of India (SBI) the second-highest disbursements are by Punjab National Bank (PNB). In the private sector, ICICI Bank with Rs 12,982 crore is the second-largest lender, followed by Axis Bank with Rs 8,099 crore.PSBs have traditionally been the dominant lenders to the MSME sector. But the typical trend for last few years is that private banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have strongly competed with PSBs in gaining a larger share of the MSME sector. However, that trend changed after the nationwide lockdown. As of June 20, NBFCs had a share of 9.7% of MSME lending — down from 13% in March, followed by private banks with 38.7% share in loans and PSBs with 51.6% marketshare, according TransUnion Cibil. The state-run lenders still account for over 60% of the banking business in the country.SBI, in an investor call on February 4, had said that the bank had sanctioned Rs 26,000 crore (cumulative) under the ECLGS. Of this, Rs 23,000 crore has been disbursed cumulatively. The bank also said that only Rs 488 crore was disbursed under ECLGS-2 and the rest was in ECLGS-1. In the call, the bank’s chairman Dinesh Khara said that although the window for restructuring for medium and small business enterprises is available up to March 31, the additions would not be substantial. He said that the ECLGS disbursements were lower in the latest quarter because the bank had picked up SME growth in segments other than the ECLGS scheme.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-beats-sbi-in-covid-scheme-loans/articleshow/80775930.cms

The two investors together hold more than 50% in the company, which was co-founded by Utpal Isser, who earlier headed rural banking in ICICI, and veteran banker Sameer Mishra. Isser told TOI the company is targeting rural households that are looking for growth capital and those who are seeking funding outside the joint lending groups of banks. These would be at a level above those targeted by microfinance companies. “Considering that only a third of income in rural areas comes from farming, we have decided to look at lending outside the sectoral verticals like agriculture, salaried or self-employed and provide loans assessing borrowers at household levels,” he said.According to Isser, SarvaGram uses technology extensively to enable its employees to take credit decision within minutes and restricts transactions to digital without the use of cash. The engagement with customers is through physical interaction. He said that this model was scalable because every business unit (branch) was profitable within six months. At the end of next year, the company expects to have a loan book of Rs 325 crore, which will grow to Rs 7,000-8,000 crore in five years.“We are currently present in Gujarat and Maharashtra and will be in four states by adding Karnataka and Rajasthan soon,” said Isser. By the middle of next year, SarvaGram will have 50 branches and a presence in four states. The company is targeting 500 branches with 5,000 officials covering 5 lakh borrowers.According to Isser, the high level of engagement with the borrower has enabled SarvaGram to continue with its collection efficiency during the pandemic with the company back to growing its loan book by the second quarter.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rural-lending-co-sarvagram-raises-rs-77cr/articleshow/80740015.cms

This comes after general concerns among the public that have arisen over Facebook sharing user data among its group companies.HDFC Bank, which was earlier offering customers the option to obtain bank account balances through WhatsApp banking, has discontinued the facility. Customers seeking balance inquiry are asked to use the bank’s mobile banking app, net banking or other offline methods. Others — ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank — continue to allow customers to check their balance. According to an industry source, earlier the idea was to have deep integration with the bank’s systems and artificial intelligence chatbots so that customers can get their servicing requests and even transactions done in a straight-through manner. The idea was to facilitate the entire banking experience through the social media platform, where customers spend most of their time, without having to log into net banking. Now there appears to be some caution in using WhatsApp banking as a channel. It is not clear whether HDFC Bank’s change in WhatsApp services is part of its ongoing back office overhaul or review of the WhatsApp policy.Incidentally, all WhatsApp banking chats come with a label stating that while these are encrypted, the bank may use a service to store, read and respond to messages and calls. According to Rajshekhar Rajaharia, a researcher on internet security who pointed out the policy change, businesses and solution providers will use WhatsApp’s parent company, Facebook, to securely store messages and respond to customers.While Facebook will not automatically use messages to determine the ads that you see, businesses will be able to use chats they receive for their own marketing purposes, which may include advertising on Facebook.Responding to a query from TOI, an ICICI Bank spokesperson said, “Messages to the ICICI Bank WhatsApp Banking service are secured with end-to-end encryption. This means that WhatsApp or third parties cannot read them. Further, the delivered chats are neither shared with Facebook nor saved in the servers of Facebook.” Facebook has meanwhile integrated a WhatsApp button on the homepage of banks. Customers will have the option to chat with the bank clicking on the button. The button is also available on some advertisements. According to WhatsApp’s privacy policy, “Facebook may use the way you interact with these ads to personalise the ads you see on Facebook.”Experts say that WhatsApp messages, being encrypted, are more secure than SMSs, which are viewable to telecom companies and government agencies and can also be intercepted by hackers. However, the concerns are not about hacking but privacy with organisations using customer data to sell third-party products.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-review-services-policy-for-whatsapp/articleshow/80456000.cms

In the process, the index also recouped most of the over 1,200-point loss that it had witnessed since touching an all-time intraday high at 49,795 points on January 13. The day’s gains added about Rs 3.5 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 195.9 lakh crore.On the NSE, the Nifty closed 240 points, also 1.7%, higher at 14,521. According to LKP Securities head (research) S Ranganathan, the markets began on a positive note on support from global cues with Janet Yellen, the incoming US treasury secretary, calling for a much larger stimulus to bolster that country’s response to the pandemic. The gains in the afternoon trade were supported by hopes of positive foreign flows next month due to change in MSCI indices.“FPI (foreign portfolio investor) inflows of Rs 17,500 crore this month and hopes of strategic divestment have pushed bears on the back foot,” Ranganathan wrote in a note. A section of market players here are also concerned about the implications of Yellen’s statement on Tuesday that the US tax cut of 2017, which favoured the wealthy, should be reversed. Tuesday’s strong gains, however, came despite muted foreign fund net buying, while domestic funds were net sellers. End-of-the-day data on the BSE showed that while FPIs were net buyers at Rs 258 crore, domestic institutions were net sellers at Rs 199 crore. Additionally, the gains came despite the rising number of infections in several parts of Europe and concerns about the economic condition in those regions.Dealers feel muted foreign fund flows may not be good news for the Indian market, more so after the over $23-billion net inflows that the Indian market witnessed between October and December last year. Compared to an average daily net inflow of about Rs 2,800 crore during November and December, in January it has come down to about Rs 1,250 crore, according to CDSL data.In Tuesday’s session, HDFC, Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank contributed the most to the sensex’s gains.

The private lender will also not charge interest on cash withdrawals during the 45-day free credit period.This comes at a time when the market leaders in the credit card business are charging interest on revolving balances at the rate of 1.99% to 3.5% per month, which is about 40% annually. IDFC First’s credit card will not have an annual charge and reward points too would not have any expiry. 80282960While not all cardholders will be eligible for the best rate of 9%, young customers without the required track record will be charged annual interest at 36%, which is still lower than leading players. The bank is looking at segmenting the market into wealthy global customers, those who are big spenders and have excellent credit records. For millennials and big spenders, the attraction would be relatively higher rewards, which will be available on all transactions except fuel and insurance premium.The initiative is being driven by the bank’s chief operating officer B Madhivanan, who joined in the previous year from ICICI Bank, where he was chief technology officer and head of digital initiatives. Incidentally, IDFC First Bank’s MD & CEO V Vaidynathan too was head of ICICI Bank’s retail business before he moved to do a management buyout of Future Group’s financial service business, which was later merged with IDFC First Bank.According to Madhivanan, the pandemic has redefined payments in the country with a huge shift to digital. “While the credit card market is crowded, we see scope for growth as many potential customers are facing barriers. Our strategy is to come out with a product, which does away with all the barriers, makes life simple and gives cardholders a rewarding experience,” Madhivanan said .The credit card range comprising four variants — Millennia, Classic, Select and Wealth — will initially be offered to existing customers by invitation.

Raids were being conducted to arrest them. “We expect Kotak Mahindra Bank authorities to submit a detailed report on Monday regarding transactions made from the government account,” Kumar said.He said at least four persons were being interrogated in this connection.Sources said a manager-rank employee of Kotak Mahindra Bank, who was earlier posted at its Exhibition Road branch, and a sales team employee of ICICI Bank, who had opened Nipendra’s account, were being interrogated.Sources said Nipendra (27) had opened a current account on December 4, 2020. “This is just a month before an attempt was made to transfer Rs11.73 crore to his account. The bank account might have been opened solely for fraudulent transactions. A cheque of another bank was submitted by Nipendra as initial deposit for opening the current account. But that cheque had bounced and the account was made inactive by the bank,” the sources said.He said Nipendra was probably used just to open the current account for fraudulent transaction of government funds as professional con men were working behind the curtain.Another police source privy to the investigation said a senior officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank at Exhibition Road is also under scanner as his banking credentials were used in making most of the fraudulent transactions from the government account to other bank accounts.

The laptops and mobiles seized from them will be scruitinized.The officer said CCB has sent requests to Google Play Store to suspend 25 mobile applications as they are illegal and existed against the investment as well as lending norms in the country.Pramoda and Pavan told the CCB sleuths that they came across an online advertisement posted by the Chinese requiring them to set up a call centre in Bengaluru. “Their role was to register a company and recruit tele-callers, while the money part was taken care of by the Chinese. More than 100 telecallers were recruited at Rs 8,000 as monthly salary and they were given a target of at least 10 loan referrals every day. “Their job was to make abusive phone calls to defaulting customers, access the contact list of the defaulters and shame them by sending messages to all their contacts.

The court of additional civ,"VADODARA: The allegations levelled by ICICI Bank against one of its shareholders from Ahmedabad fell flat in a local court recently. The court of additional civil judge H J Gadhvi junked the case on the grounds that it had failed to prove their allegations against Vaghela. The private bank had alleged that Babu Vaghela, who lives in Vejalpur area, had disrupted the bank’s AGM in 2012 by raising personal issues not connected to the bank and videotaped the meeting. Vaghela was also accused of uploading the video on YouTube, tweeting defamatory statements against then chairman K V Kamath and then CEO Chanda Kochhar and sending emails against them to government officials. The bank had sought a compensation of Rs 1 lakh from Vaghela, unconditional apology and restraining him from defaming them both. During the hearing, Vaghela had denied the allegations and had stated that the legal case had been filed against him to harass and torture him. “My client’s allegations were never against the bank nor did he have any ill motive. It is true that he used to raise issues in every AGM but those were purely against then chairman and CEO and not against the bank,” said Sandip Purani, the lawyer who argued for Vaghela.“Even at the AGM when he spoke, he did it out of the Constitutional right,” Purani said, adding that Vaghela and Kochhar were colleagues in the past before she joined ICICI Bank and had disputes over some issues. Purani also argued that since the ‘defamatory’ statements against Kamath and Kochhar in their personal capacity, they did not come forward as complainants in the case and the bank had no legal stand. The bank’s officials who had filed the suit also admitted before the court that they were not authorized by either Kamath or Kochhar to file the suit.

At close of trading on Wednesday, Infosys had a market capitalization of Rs 5.3 lakh crore, the fifth largest company by market value in India. On Wednesday, the Infosys ADR was up by 0.5% during the opening hours.The rally on Tuesday was fuelled by the landmark $3-billion deal with German automotive major Daimler for infrastructure overhaul and cloud migration services.India’s market cap league table is led by Reliance Industries at Rs 12.3 lakh crore, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank and HUL. Infosys is ahead of HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.79933688Since March, when its market cap was 2.7 lakh crore, Infosys’s market cap has almost doubled. Under CEO Salil Parekh, Infosys has got its mojo back, participating in large deal pursuits, making tuck-in acquisitions and putting a tight-knit cloud narrative in its go-to-market offerings. Infosys has bagged three deals over $1 billion dollars – Verizon, Vanguard and Daimler – in the last one year. The Daimler deal will bolster Infosys's presence in the automotive space. A $1-billion Pfizer contract, sources said, is being hotly-contested by Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, and other MNC peers.Jimit Arora, partner in US IT research advisory Everest Group, said he expects 2021 to be a potentially stellar growth year for three key reasons: mega deals, pent-up demand from 2020, overall modernisation, and digital transformation moves from pilot to programme.Mrinal Rai, principal analyst in IT advisory ISG, said he sees slight improvements or perhaps acceleration in annualised contract values (ACVs) for the March quarter globally if some of the larger transactions come to award.“The Infosys-Daimler contract is on similar lines of transferring and transitioning. ISG has explained in its quarterly index that many large enterprises would try to shed off their captive centres and most of these large deals would be examples of such initiatives. Also, deals of this size usually are signed for longer duration (more than five years on an average). However, with Covid-19 and resulting changes, clients are mostly looking for digital transformation initiatives that can be executed at a faster rate and in shorter duration,” he said.Sandip Agarwal of Edelweiss Securities said that with the US presidential election completed, news about more such deals is expected to be announced. “We believe the current technology wave is the biggest in history and that consensus and companies will keep upgrading numbers and guidance hereon. We maintain digitalisation is a more potent catalyst for Infosys than IMS (infrastructure management services), which lifted m-caps of competition by 9.8–14.5x over 2009–16,” a report by Edelweiss Securities noted.Edelweiss Securities has a price target of Rs 1,850 for Infosys. At this level, Infosys’s stock price will be more than three-and-half times its March low at Rs 511. A recent study by Motilal Oswal Financial Services showed that Infosys has been the fastest wealth creator in the last 25 years, with the stock multiplying a staggering 688 times, and the third biggest.

In an interview to TOI, he","NEW DELHI: Veteran banker K V Kamath says that soft interest rates will provide the tailwind for businesses to come out of the crisis. In an interview to TOI, he speaks on why a fresh pile of corporate bad loans is not expected to build up due to the pandemic. Excerpts:Which are the segments that are bearing the brunt of the economic pain? Is the pain hidden?Early indications are that larger corporates don’t need debt restructuring support as they have deleveraged. From a debt-equity ratio of 2:1 in 2010, the top ones are now down to 0.5:2. Also, they have got a helping hand because of lower interest rates. It looks like SMEs are also back as they are feeders for large companies, which are now back at 90%. The government measures have made the pain bearable. If we had not opened when we did, the pain would have been very visible.What needs to be carefully watched are the self-employed — persons working with their own hands and the street vendors. It is for us to look at pockets where pain persists and to provide handholding. Although only 80-85% of people are back at work, companies are reporting production at 90%, which means there are productivity gains and the people who are not at work are probably hurting. While retail borrowers also benefit from lower rates, in a couple of weeks, we will have a better picture of the stressed borrowers — the self-employed and those employed in stressed sectors.79889042Which are the companies that are coming up for restructuring?So far, there is no clarity on which companies are hurting as no names have come up. When we did our sitting (in August), it was clear that the first quarter had gone badly and there was a 20-25% loss in production. It looks like they have made up for it in the second quarter. On the retail side, the banks have opened up their websites for applications. The first half results of the 4,000 companies was a pleasant surprise as it showed an expansion in earnings, indicating that there is improved efficiency, which is here to stay.There have been concerns over the proposal to allow corporates to set up banks...What the working group has articulated is three points — the existing structure is not enough to meet our aspirations, the private sector has done well in utilising capital, and internal supervision must improve to support the expansion of banking. Today, the technology to supervise is available. It is possible to get a single view of a customer across all banks, which was not there earlier. What one needs to look at is whether there is any objection (to corporates promoting banks) if internal processes and implementation is tightened.Is there a case for a bad bank?The discussion in a way is academic, the last clean-up that was done in end-2019 was deep enough and capital has been infused. The need for a bad bank would arise if there is a fresh pile of bad debts coming up. So far, we do not see that happening and my view is that we do not need a bad bank as assets are on the mend or capital has already been provided.The RBI has traditionally dealt with bank failures through mergers. Now that branches are no longer attractive, how would resolutions take place?I must commend the RBI on how it has addressed recent challenges. A theoretical construct has been established that if you move quickly and write down equity and tier-2 instruments, that would be enough as long as there are entities to take over cleaned-up banks. Even if branches do not have the same purpose as before, if there are players willing to induct technology and who find a use for the branches it will help. Today, any player is only as strong as the regulatory shield available.Is there really a regulatory shield considering there are neobanks?If you look at any of the payment platforms in China — whether it is Alipay or WeChat, the backbone is the bank through which the money moves. The regulator is comfortable with this as it is possible to set daily limits in a manner that it can be controlled and be in service. Banks are happy to partner with such players as long as they have different revenue models from the banks. The issue will be when they are in competition. We have not seen that yet. Technology must come in a regulated way. Every single player in the financial services must be agile, nimble and adept at using technology. Is it also time to look at cryptocurrency and things like that?I am distant from that product. I don’t understand the product or value-creation in the product. Some of the tools, such as blockchain, have got use and it will get integrated into technology practices.How do you look at the developments at ICICI Bank over the last few years and would you have driven it in the same way as it is running now?It’s not right for me to comment, but if I go back 20-25 years, we set up the bank given what we had in terms of technology. That was the only way we could have grown. We took product leadership in areas where it looked like pioneering bets. The leadership needs to benchmarked on that basis. If they are continuing to do that, I would be happy. But it is their call.Do you see some reluctance among bankers to lend? Do the recent investigative actions have had a role to play?Banks realise that they are not purveyors of long-term funds given the tenor limitations. Second, demand was not at that level because corporate India was going through a churn.The banker’s dharma is to lend, he will lend but will lend cautiously given that he is conscious of ALM mismatches. The marketplace for long-term is getting active with insurance companies achieving scale.Is there a need to have DFIs. What are the learnings that will help avoid that situation 15-20 years down the line?The old DFIs were supported by the government for long-term funding. In a way it looked like venture capital fund as they also provided equity and financed up to 80% of a company’s requirement. Today, markets can provide equity, banks can invest in shorter dated instruments and longer-term must be funded from capital markets. There is a system that is throwing up long-term funding, which did not exist earlier. One lesson from BRICS Bank is that there is an interesting market for these products. The weighted average rating of these five countries is just about investment grade, when they come together, they get AA+ rating, helping access funds at about the finest rates. If you keep yourself lean, the differential in cost is more than made up. The same lesson can go into DFIs. Credit underwriting has become a different game given the improvement in rating skills with the agencies and technology.Is the deleveraging cycle over?The cost of debt is significantly lower than the cost of equity. The sheer cash flow generated by Corporate India is self-sustaining to finance growth, which means we are not as debt hungry as in the past. We will continue with this. Debt will be required at the infrastructure-end and retail-end. The retail customer will be debt hungry and retail debt to GDP is quite low so we have a lot of things to do there.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/large-cos-dont-need-debt-recast-kamath/articleshow/79889043.cms

Paytm Bank had a transaction decline ratio of 0.8 for every 1 lakh transactions as against the industry average of 17 per 1 lakh.According to National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) data for November, of the 226 crore UPI transactions, SBI had the largest share of 26%, followed by Axis Bank (11%), HDFC Bank (8%), Paytm Bank (8%) and ICICI Bank (6%). SBI processes over 2 crore transactions daily as against 60 lakh by HDFC Bank and 56 lakh by Paytm Bank.Though SBI has the largest share, it is also responsible for bringing down the industry average in terms of declines. NPCI’s data shows that SBI reported 31 technical declines for every 1 lakh transactions, doing better than only Bank of India, which had 33 failures. Technical decline rate reflects the reliability of the platform. NPCI defines these declines as payments that failed due to technical reasons, such as unavailability of systems and network issues on bank or NPCI side. Among the public sector banks, the best performer was Oriental Bank of Commerce, which matches Paytm Bank’s rate of 0.8 per lakh but it has less than 1% of total volumes. Bank of Baroda at 5%, had the highest market share in UPI transactions among nationalised banks, followed by Punjab National Bank (4%), Bank of India (3%) and Union Bank of India (3%). “Our performance is a testament to the hard work that the team puts in to provide the best technology infrastructure in the global banking space. We are well ahead of others when it comes to leveraging AI and Big Data to offer innovative products & services to our customers across the country. Our tech team, which comprises the best minds in the business, works round-the-clock to provide a seamless and efficient experience,” said Satish Gupta, MD & CEO, Paytm Payments Bank. He added that for most banks the UPI transactions are driven by third-party apps, Paytm Bank is the only one in the country to organically drive UPI transactions. Google Pay and PhonePe currently dominate third-party apps in UPI payments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-bank-has-lowest-upi-failure-rate/articleshow/79847126.cms

ICICI said it has taken possession under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (Sarfesi). The bank issued a demand notice in November asking the borrower, Shore Dwellings Pvt Ltd (formerly known as Mantri Dwellings Pvt Ltd), to repay about Rs 53.6 crore within sixty days of receipt of the notice. Having failed to repay the amount, the bank has taken possession.“The company is engaged with the bankers to find a suitable way out to resolve the issue amicably and get reschedulement done at earliest, so that the NPA and possession notice issue get withdraw,” Mantri Developers’ chief financial officer S Baaskaran said in a statement to TOI. The company also said it had given the corporate office as additional collateral security against a project which was developed in Pune. “The project has seen good sales at the beginning and has sold 32% of the total project. However, due to prevailing market conditions for the last twelve months the sales could not happen as per the original projections and hence sales milestone condition of bank could not be fulfilled, because of which the bank stopped disbursing any further money,” Mantri added.Mantri is a prominent developer in Bengaluru, but in the last few years the company has run into trouble with regulators over the location of certain properties. TOI reported earlier this year that Prestige and RMZ Corp have formed a joint venture to buy a commercial project from Mantri for about Rs 1,500 crore.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-takes-possession-of-mantri-corporate-office/articleshow/77457894.cms

Non-customers can also apply for ICICI Bank credit cards and loans and open a savings account using the app.ICICI Bank’s use of its app to acquire customers of other banks comes days after HDFC Bank was barred from launching new digital initiatives and from issuing credit cards to new customers by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) following repeated outages of services. Incidentally, SBI’s flagship Yono app too saw downtime last week, inconveniencing customers. “Many non-customers are keen to use iMobile and customers are tired of using multiple apps for different purposes and they really want to know if an app can take care of all banking and payments requirements,” said ICICI Bank ED Anup Bagchi, explaining the rationale for allowing the integration of other accounts.The RBI has been encouraging banks towards ‘open banking’ through the account aggregator route. Banks can choose to be part of the framework, following which third-party providers can offer customers a single view of all their bank accounts. In October, IndusInd Bank became the first to join the aggregator platform. Last month, Axis Bank was the second to join this framework. The larger banks are yet to sign up.In a way, UPI helps aggregate bank accounts as a customer can use a single bank’s app to link multiple bank accounts and use the same for transfers and payments. According to IT experts, while a third-party app can be a backup if the problem is with the main bank’s app, a problem at the data server cannot be addressed by using a different app.“This is yet another initiative that will inspire the ecosystem to integrate interoperability on digital platforms,” said NPCI MD & CEO Dilip Asbe. “UPI is known to provide seamless, secure and convenient payment experience to its users, and we believe that the large-scale adoption of UPI will strengthen the ecosystem and help in achieving the common goal of less-cash society,” he added.Open banking is the solution that banking regulators worldwide have come up with to the problem that the ‘stickiness’ in bank accounts makes it difficult for customers to port to other accounts. The RBI had earlier mooted portability of account numbers. However, one problem was that the number of digits would get too unwieldy.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-uses-flagship-app-to-get-rivals-customers/articleshow/79613064.cms

Ltd. and its subsidiaries. The authority on November 6 rejected a plea by the Enforcement Directorate to confirm its provisional attachment of the properties including a flat held in the name of Deepak Kochhar at CCI building in Mumbai.“The flat is not involved in money laundering,” said the 800-page order. ED had also provisionally attached cash of Rs 10.5 Lakhs. The attachment has not been confirmed by the authority under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act(PMLA) under which Deepak Kochhar, husband of former CEO of ICICI Bank, Chanda Kochhar, was arrested.Last January the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), New Delhi registered a case for offences of cheating and criminal conspiracy under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act against Kochhar and his wife among others for allegedly causing loss to ICICI bank by sanctioning loans to Videocon Group in contravention of bank’s rules and policies.The authority in its order said the FIR “fails to justify any investigation having been done before alleging the wrongful loss in respect of the RTL of Rs. 300 crores from ICICI Bank to M/s VIEL. The said RTL loan account of Rs 300 crore is shown by D-1 (Chanda Kochhar) to be not declared NPA.”The PMLA Authority also observed that no material has been placed on record to show that the properties attached are likely to be dealt with in any manner saying, “The Deputy Director issued the Provisional Attachment Order invoking the second proviso of section 5(1) without forming the justifying reasonable belief as statutorily required.”The November 6 order further observed that statements of Chanda Kochhar have not been placed on record by ED. “Nothing is stated by her in the said statement that there was any bribe money involved in relation to any of the loans sanctioned to the Videocon Group Companies. As other statements of D-1 (Kochhar) are not placed before this Authority, it is not known to this Authority as to what she has stated against the allegations of bribery and bribe money.”Appearing for the Kochhars’ Advocate Vijay Aggarwal and Ashul Agarwal had argued that Provisional Attachment Order [PAO] and application filed by ED merely contain a mechanical reproduction of the words in the statute or fictional fear without there being any apparent basis and material on record to arrive at any such ‘Reasons to believe’ that the properties are being concealed, transferred or dealt with, which is a mandatory pre-requisite or condition precedent for exercise of powers under the 2nd proviso of Section 8 PMLA. Merely mentioning that there is an ‘intelligence input’ is neither justified nor sufficient for satisfying the requirements under Section 5(1) of PMLA. The PAO is issued on 10.01.2020 in respect of ECIR recorded on 31.01.2019, showing absolute lack of any sense of immediacy mandatory to invoke 2nd proviso to Section 5(1) of PMLA, argued Aggarwal.ED has attached wind power assets which are large sized turbines or windmills (80-100 meters height) spread over several acres of land. Wind Power assets have admittedly been mortgaged to Banks against Project finance. Hence, they cannot be ‘concealed’ as alleged, argued the lawyers.Moreover, the ground taken for provisional attachment that the amount of Rs. 10.5 Lakhs would be frittered away is fallacious it was argued as the Provisional Attachment Order was passed after the order passed by Adjudicating Authority permitting retention of seized amount on 13.08.2019 and the cash is now held in FD by the ED. “Thus the alleged reason to attach the same so as to ensure that the same is not concealed, transferred, alienated, disposed off or dealt with in any manner that may frustrate the proceedings under PMLA is ex-facie non est” it was argued.In its detailed order the Adjudicating Authority observed that Rs. 64 Crores were invested by VN Dhoot in his own entity “Rs 64 crore were invested by Videocon Group its own entity NRL which was 95% owned by the Videocon Group when the funds were invested and that the investment of Rs 64 crore continues to be under the ownership and control of Videocon Group in the form of ownership of Optionally Convertible Debentures of value of Rs. 64 crores issued in October 2011 by SEPL, which are continued to be owned by Real Cleantech Pvt Ltd, again a Videocon Group Company.”Hence, the amount of Rs 64 crore cannot be termed as a bribe as its an investment by VN Dhoot in his own company.On the attachment of residential flat it was observed that it cannot be proceeds of crime “It is beyond doubt that the flat was purchased by D-2 in the year 1995-96 much before the period of alleged scheduled offences i.e. 2009-2012 and prior to coming into force of PMLA, 2002. It is evident from the facts aforesaid that the said acquired flat was not from the alleged proceeds of crime and the consideration paid way back in the year 1995-96 could not have been designated as proceeds of crime, from any source whatsoever.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pmla-adjudicatory-body-doesnt-confirm-attachment-by-ed-of-deepak-kochhars-flat-in-mumbai/articleshow/79207680.cms

Subsidy announcement for fertilisers is likely to help rural & agricultural sectors, while expansion of production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for 10 additional sectors will boost domestic manufacturing in the long-term, he said.Going forward, though rising inflation — at 76-month high of 7.6% in October — could weigh on policymakers and central bankers, the slow but steady growth of monthly IIP numbers could act as a comforting factor. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services chief economist Nikhil Gupta, this combination of high inflation (among the highest in the world) and better growth will make it difficult for policymakers to ease policies further. “We need to be careful about inflation trajectory,” Gupta said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-4k-pt-run-sensex-falls-on-profit-booking/articleshow/79200137.cms

This would also result in the share of home loans in the bank’s books going up further.Bagchi attributed the increased pace of loan disbursement to the digitisation of the loan application process, which enabled faster processing of loans.

Chairman Mukesh Ambani’s net worth also went down by Rs 59,100 crore, which pushed him three places down in the world’s rich list to the ninth spot. The day’s crash came on the back of a 7% drop in RIL’s net profit for the July-September quarter and also a sharp cut in its target price by one of the leading foreign brokerages Macquarie.

The satellite data will replace physical visits that have been done hitherto to assess a host of parameters on land location, irrigation levels and crop quality patterns to forecast future revenues of the farmers.Speaking to newsperson Anup Bagchi, executive director, ICICI Bank said: “We have already rolled this out in 500 villages in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat and it has been beneficial to farmers. While we had been working on this for two years we had not commercialized it because there are multiple data sets used – weather, water levels, satellite imagery on colour changes and we wanted confidence level to be above 90% as margin for error in lending is very small,” he said. The bank plans to scale up the initiative to 63,000 villages in two months.Bagchi added that while the different sets of data were always available, the innovation was in stitching together the data inputs and coming out with the analytics to forecast farm output. He likened the innovation to other efficiencies thrust upon banks due to Covid like to video calls replacing face to face meetings.""This use of innovative technology helps farmers with existing credit to enhance their eligibility, while new-to-credit farmers can now get better access to credit,"" he said.ICICI Bank has partnered with agri–fintech companies specializing in harnessing space technology and weather information for commercial usage. It has worked closely with them to build reports with over 40 parameters for assessing the credit-worthiness of a farmer with a deep study of the land, irrigation, and crop patterns.The bank will use these inputs to review limits for existing borrowers and also extending KCC (Kisan Credit Card) loans to new customers. KCC attributed one-third to the Bank’s rural loan portfolio of Rs 57177 crore in the quarter ended June 30, 2020.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-to-use-satellite-data-for-approving-farm-loans/articleshow/77742925.cms

Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel and HDFC Bank led the slide, while Kotak Bank, Infosys and TCS cushioned the fall to some extent. On the NSE, the Nifty closed at 11,251, down 254 points or 2.2%.After opening on a flat note, the market witnessed a one-way selloff as European indices opened weak and went into a slide. At one point, the sensex was down 907 points and closed just a tad off the intra-day low. Of the 30 sensex stocks, only three closed with gains.Mid- and small-cap stocks witnessed a stronger selloff with the BSE’s mid-cap index closing 3.4% lower, while the small-cap one closed 3.6% down. The day’s slide also left investors poorer by nearly Rs 4 lakh crore with the BSE’s market valuation now at Rs 153.4 lakh crore. There were reports that, led by HSBC, several global banks had helped launder money across the world. Also, there were indications that the UK could again go for another lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections.According to HDFC Securities head (retail research) Deepak Jasani, after the European markets opened, traders were quick to unwind their long positions fearing further weakness. “Asian shares slipped on Monday on fears the global economy may sizzle for a while due to a resurgence of the coronavirus infections in Europe, while fading hopes for US fiscal stimulus also weighed,” Jasani said. European stocks fell the most since July after a report alleged that several global banks had helped launder money across the world, he said.With the Dow Jones index down over 900 points or 3% in early trades on Monday evening in the US, also due to rising virus fears, market players are expecting another weak session on Tuesday on Dalal Street.Technically, too, according to Kotak Securities EVP (equity technical research) Shrikant Chouhan, investors could expect the Indian market to remain under pressure on Tuesday. “On the charts, the Nifty has changed its trading range — 11,300, which was earlier support level for the index, will now act as resistance.

There is a strong possibility that Chanda Kochhar and Videocon group’s chairman Venugopal Dhoot might also face action for being evasive during questioning over the past one year.In January this year, ED had attached assets of Kochhars to the tune of Rs 78 crore as “proceeds of crime”. The agency, in its provisional attachment order, accused the banker and her husband of receiving Rs 64 crore from Videocon in NuPower Renewables Ltd, owned by Deepak Kochhar. The transfer was in September 2009, just a day after Chanda Kochhar-led ICICI Bank sanctioned a loan of Rs 300 crore to Videocon International Electronics Limited.Chanda Kochhar is accused of “illegal sanctioning of loans” to the tune of Rs 1,875 crore to Videocon group of companies. CBI first filed an FIR against the former ICICI Bank CEO and her husband on 22 January 2019. Later, the ED initiated an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act trailing Rs 325 crore Deepak Kochhar received in his Nupower Renewables from two Mauritius entities. “We’ve traced all the bribe money paid to the Kochhars by Dhoot through banking transactions in companies and trusts owned and controlled by them,” said a senior official involved with the investigation. The source said during her questioning Chanda Kochhar was completely evasive and so was Dhoot despite the fact that the agency confronted them with the transactions resulting out of an alleged quid pro quo.Kochhar was instrumental in the ICICI Bank refinancing huge loans to the Videocon group which later turned non-performing assets (NPA) for the bank. In turn, Chanda Kochhar and her family allegedly received an apartment in Mumbai, worth Rs 75 crore, owned by one of the Videocon group companies. This was done by way of acquiring the company through Chanda Kochhar's family trust at a nominal price by creating book entries, according to ED in its provisional attachment order. A book entry is where no actual transaction takes place but in account books entries are merely introduced.The other assets attached by the ED belonging to Kochhars include wind farm projects located in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.

Earlier, its disclosure about having an over 1% stake in housing finance major HDFC had led to some hectic activity at the Centre, including a change of rules for FDI from neighbouring countries.The Chinese central bank has picked up a minuscule stake through a Rs 15-crore investment in the bank’s recently concluded qualified institutional placement (QIP), through which the Indian private sector lender had raised Rs 15,000 crore, sources said. The stake was bought through an arm of PBoC, a source said without elaborating about the exact structure.PBoC’s stake is very insignificant when compared to ICICI Bank’s market capitalisation of almost Rs 2.40 lakh crore, a source said. Current rules require that all listed companies should disclose the names of shareholders who hold 1% or more of the listed entity’s equity capital. Additionally, rules require that the names of all those investors who pick up at least 5% in a QIP offer should be disclosed. Hence, PBoC’s name does not show up in any of ICICI Bank’s recent disclosures, the source said. 77623366In Tuesday’s strong market, the ICICI Bank stock on the BSE closed 2.5% higher at Rs 369. The share purchase comes at a time when the government is looking to clamp down on stake acquisitions by Chinese portfolio investors. The finance ministry and Sebi are seen to be dragging their feet on the issue.Currently, among Indian companies, PBoC has stakes in HDFC, Ambuja Cement and Piramal Enterprises. In all the companies, the holding is below the 1% level, which necessitates compulsory disclosure. By March-end, PBoC’s stake in HDFC was slightly above the 1% level as it bought some shares just before the Indian and Chinese military forces’ skirmish in the Galwan valley in Ladakh region. However, during the April-June quarter, the Chinese central bank sold part of its stake in HDFC and, as of June-end, it had fallen below the 1% level, company officials said.In Piramal Enterprises, as of June-end, the Chinese central bank had a 0.43% stake, while in Ambuja Cement, as of December-end, it had a 0.32% stake. There are market rumours that PBoC also has small stakes in a few more listed companies.

On the same day, India’s biggest commercial airline operator InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) said its board has approved raising Rs 4,000 crore, also through a QIP issue.According to ICICI Bank’s term sheet, the plan is to raise up to Rs 15,000 crore at a floor price of just over Rs 351 per share, while the indicative price range is Rs 355-358. On Monday, the stock on the BSE closed at nearly Rs 364. At the upper end of the QIP price, there is a discount of 1.5% to the stock’s last closing level. The final decision on allotment and the total amount of funds to be raised will be taken on August 14, ICICI Bank said. The stocks allotted in the QIP are scheduled to be listed on August 20. Recently, ICICI Bank had sold nearly 4% of its stake in ICICI Lombard, its non-life insurance arm, and mobilised almost Rs 2,300 crore. HDFC Bank and ICICI Securities are among the merchant bankers to the ICICI Bank offer.On its part, IndiGo said it would raise up to Rs 4,000 crore. Its board “considered and approved the raising of funds for an aggregate amount not exceeding Rs 4,000 crore through an issue of equity shares by way of a qualified institutional placement…subject to approval of the company’s shareholders and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals”. In Monday’s flat market, the Indigo stock on the BSE closed over 1.4% higher at Rs 953.Of late, lenders are in a rush to raise funds from the market. Analysts said that with the Covid-19 pandemic playing havoc with the economy, bankers expect a large number of people to default on their loans, leading to a surge in bad loans. Subsequently, lenders will need to provide for these and hence the rush among lenders to raise funds as long as the stock market is rallying. In the past few months, several lenders have raised funds. Among the large deals, earlier this month Axis Bank raised Rs 10,000 crore through a QIP offer, while in July Kotak Mahindra Bank had raised nearly Rs 7,500 crore.

The other members of the committee are Diwakar Gupta, currently serving at Asian Development Bank, T Manoharan, currently chairman of Canara Bank, and Ashvin Parekh, a strategy consultant. The CEO of the Indian Banks’ Association will serve the committee as its member secretary. If required, the RBI may bring in new members also, the central bank said in a release. The committee has been mandated to place its report to the central bank, which will put the recommendations in the public domain in 30 days. While announcing a one-time loan-resolution scheme on Thursday, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had announced that Kamath would lead the panel, although the names of other members had not been disclosed. 77423184The latest appointment marks the return of the former ICICI Bank chief into the domestic arena after spending the last five years in Shanghai as the first head of New Development Bank, the multilateral funding agency set up by BRICS member nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Kamath, the veteran banker credited with transforming the staid development financial institution into a universal bank, is an old hand in helping the revival of stressed companies, having seen several downturns. His appointment also puts an end to speculation in Mumbai over the possibility of the 73-year-old joining the government as a minister.The panel under Kamath has been tasked with recommending the financial parameters to be included in the resolution plans, with sector-specific benchmark ranges for such parameters. “The committee shall also undertake the process validation for the resolution plans to be implemented under this framework, without going into the commercial aspects, in respect of all accounts with aggregate exposure of Rs 1,500 crore and above at the time of invocation,” the central bank said.The committee will submit its recommendations on the financial parameters to the RBI, which, in turn, will notify the same along with modifications, if any, in 30 days, the release said.According to a report by ratings agency CARE, the resolution plan announced by the RBI is a significant relief to entities which have been affected by severe stress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent economic disruption. The report, however, said that the current version of the loan-restructuring scheme with several requirements on eligibility, provisioning and loan extension, is more rigorous compared to the earlier restructuring options.Crisil said the move will ease liquidity pressure on companies amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but underlined the need for timely approval from the lenders.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-notifies-kamath-led-panel-to-work-out-loan-recast-details/articleshow/77423185.cms

She has sought from the court a declaration upholding the validity of an earlier letter in October 2018 wherein ICICI Bank had accepted her early retirement.Last year in October, Kochhar had put in her papers after a controversy following accusations that the bank’s borrower, Videocon Industries, invested in her husband’s company as a quid pro quo for the bank’s loans. ICICI Bank had accepted her early retirement application and appointed Sandeep Bakshi as managing director & CEO for a term of five years. In February this year, however, Kochhar received a letter from the bank saying that she is terminated “for cause, in view of pending inquiry”. The bank also then cancelled all her benefits, right from 2008. The amount is estimated to be significantly high. 72301696 Kochhar’s case now is that once her early retirement was accepted by the bank, it cannot terminate and withhold her benefits. A Bombay HC bench of Justices Ranjit More and M S Karnik on Thursday placed the case for a hearing on December 2.The issue before the court in Kochhar’s plea is that having accepted her request for the early retirement, she no longer was an employee of the bank for it to be able to terminate her services. Unless she is restored on the rolls of the bank, she cannot be removed again. She is citing and relying on provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, particularly section 35(b), which deals with appointments and termination of chairpersons, managing directors, and directors of a company to be subject to prior approval of the RBI.Her prayer is to declare that the communication of early retirement issued by the bank in October last year is valid and the later communication of termination be quashed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kochhar-moves-hc-against-her-termination-from-icici/articleshow/72300940.cms

Banking sector plays an important role in contributing to India’s economic growth through financing infrastructure, agriculture, local manufacturing, including MSMEs. Financial inclusion can play a big role in financial empowerment through technology,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.Those invited for the interaction include Rajnish Kumar, chairman, State Bank of India, Aditya Puri, MD, HDFC Bank, Sandeep Bakhshi, MD, ICICI Bank, S S Mallikarjuna Rao, MD and CEO of Punjab National Bank, and Renu Sud Karnad, MD of HDFC, sources said.  77232231According to economists, one of the key issues facing businesses is the absence of credit growth despite easing by the RBI. “Unlike most major economies, quantitative easing in India has not led to credit-growth acceleration. With bank credit growth already at a six-decade low and a likely contraction of nominal GDP in FY21, credit too may shrink, impacting banks’ net interest income,” said Sujan Hazra, chief economist at Anand Rathi securities. Unless the liquidity injected by the RBI and credit-enhancing measures (guarantees) extended by the government lead to the acceleration of credit growth, these steps would not aid revival of growth, said Hazra in a note on credit growth. Bankers made a presentation on their suggestions on what was needed in a meeting with secretary - department of financial services, which was a dry run for their meeting on Wednesday with the Prime Minister. Officials have pointed out that despite the massive amount of liquidity, banks are not lending and are instead parking funds with the RBI. On their part, public sector banks have blamed the government’s witch hunt against bankers and pointed to instances where cases have been lodged against the entire board by CBI, prompting them to play safe. The government’s move to repeatedly comfort bankers has had little impact in improving their risk appetite.Even now, they are preferring to be cautious instead of stepping up lending, amid fears of a sharp spike in bad debt in the coming months.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pm-to-meet-top-bankers-today-discuss-credit-flow/articleshow/77229048.cms

The group saw a marginally higher consolidated net profit of Rs 1,170 crore for the latest March quarter against Rs 1,141 crore in the year-ago period.Profits for the full year were down 50% at Rs 3,363 crore from Rs 6,777 crore in FY18. This was because of heavy provisioning in the first three quarters towards bad loans. The board, which met for the results, also cleared the elevation of president (corporate centre) Sandeep Batra as executive director. Announcing the results, Batra said that the ratio of bad loans fell to its lowest level in 13 quarters. Net non-performing assets (NPAs) also reduced to 2.06% on March 31, 2019 from 2.58% as on December 31, 2018.69208895 “We believe we are at the end of the asset quality cycle and we are seeing our NPAs improving,” said Batra. “We continue to be committed to achieve a return of equity of 15% by June 2020.” The bank had a capital adequacy ratio of 6.89% — well above the regulatory requirement — over 15% of which was tier-1 capital.The bank classified a Rs 276-crore exposure to the bankrupt infra lender IL&FS as non-performing during the quarter, for which it has a provision of Rs 145 crore. It also has a non-fund exposure of Rs 545 crore to the group and has set aside Rs 468 crore as provisions against it.Batra said that the bank saw Rs 3,547 crore in fresh slippages during the quarter. A large part of this was on account of a sugar producer’s loan account that slipped into NPA category during the quarter. However, for the entire fiscal, slippages more than halved to Rs 11,039 crore from a high of Rs 28,730 crore in FY18. The overall slippages were higher than what the market expected.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-q4-net-profit-drops-by-5-to-rs-969-crore/articleshow/69208896.cms

This has taken the tally of completed and ","MUMBAI: ICICI Bank’s board on Wednesday approved a proposal to raise Rs 15,000 crore through issue of fresh equity. This has taken the tally of completed and proposed equity issuances by banks this year to nearly Rs 80,000 crore.Banks are taking advantage of the buoyancy in the capital market, making it the largest fund-raise from the markets in any year. The bulk of the capital is being raised by private banks who have already crystallised their plans, while public sector lenders like State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) have also said that they will tap the market.One positive aspect of the supportive capital market is that banks are likely to raise most of the additional funds requirement on account of the Covid-19 forecast by rating agencies. Earlier this month, Fitch Ratings forecast that Indian banks will require $15 billion (Rs 1.13 lakh crore) in a moderate stress scenario. In June, ICRA had said that public sector banks will need between Rs 45,000 crore and Rs 82,500 crore in additional capital as slippages increase by 5%. The rating agency placed the capital requirement by private banks between Rs 25,000 crore and Rs 48,300 crore. 76867585Private lenders Kotak Mahindra Bank and IDFC First Bank were the first off the block to raise funds. Kotak Bank mobilised Rs 7,442 crore in May, which helped it meet the RBI directive on dilution of promoter stake. IDFC First Bank raised Rs 2,000 crore last month. Axis Bank and Yes Bank have board approvals in place to raise Rs 15,000 crore and Yes Bank has also firmed up plans for a public offer, in which SBI said on Wednesday it will invest up to Rs 1,760 crore.In the public sector, SBI has an enabling provision from its board to raise Rs 20,000 crore and PNB’s board will meet on Thursday to approve a capital-raise. Besides pure equity, banks are also looking at raising funds by issuing quasi-equity bonds, which qualify for the purpose of capital adequacy. HDFC Bank has obtained approval to raise Rs 50,000 crore by way of additional tier-1 bonds. Bank of Baroda and Indian Bank are also looking at raising Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore by way of quasi-equity.Besides issuing equity, banks have been improving their capital position by selling stakes in insurance subsidiaries. The insurance business has been relatively less impacted by the Covid-19 crisis in the financial sector. In June, ICICI Bank raised over Rs 3,000 crore selling a stake in its insurance arms. It sold a 1.5% stake in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance for Rs 840 crore, bringing down its stake to 51.4%. It also divested 3.96% in its general insurance arm for nearly Rs 2,250 crore. In the public sector, SBI sold 2.1% stake of its stake its subsidiary SBI Life Insurance for Rs 1,522 crore. Other banks are also lining up to sell stake in their insurance arms.

According to a senior executive at a private lender, the frontline staff of the bank have been at the forefront during the Covid-19 lockdown, as banks were classified as essential services.

With the Wall Street showing a strong up move in early trades, market players expect that the rally would continue on Thursday.The day’s rally, aided mainly by a Rs 2,409-crore net buying by domestic funds, added about Rs 2 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 123.6 lakh crore. Foreign funds on the other hand were net sellers at Rs 335 crore, BSE data showed.According to Siddhartha Khemka, head (retail research), Motilal Oswal Financial Services, global sentiments are positive on the back of optimism about the re-opening of the world economy and the potential development of a coronavirus vaccine. “European markets were positive on hopes that the European Union will announce a massive stimulus programme for the region’s recovery. However, Asian markets were mixed as investors are concerned over the unrest in Hong Kong due to Beijing’s proposed national security laws as it might escalate tensions between the US and China,” he said in a note.Khemka believes Indian markets may continue its positive momentum for the next couple of days. However, apart from the global sentiments, investors will closely monitor the quarterly results, development around coronavirus cases and vaccines, US-China tensions and any announcements related to further stimulus by governments globally.Among the sensex stocks, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Axis Bank were the top contributors to the index’s gains.

Net profit was down 81% to Rs 24 crore, partly also due to exceptional items and a one-time tax charge. The decline in volumes was led by its costlier drinks segment, referred to as Prestige & Above (P&A), whose volumes tanked about 16% — “disproportionately impacted by drying up of social occasions and closure of on-premise channel in several states”. Sale of cheaper, or popular, drinks fell 11.4%.“Within the P&A segment, our bottled-in-origin (BIO) Scotch portfolio was the hardest hit,” said CEO Anand Kripalu.

The rising tension between the US and China, which comprises issues related to the Asian giant’s handling of the coronavirus crisis and also trades between the two, made global investors cautious, which also impacted trading in India, market players said.In the bond market, gilts gained marginally despite the RBI’s rate cut decision as the central and state governments’ huge borrowings weighed on sentiment.

Critical brokerage house reports on the government’s stimulus package also made investors cautious about how much and how fast the boosters could help the economy bounce back from the current state.The day’s slide was led by financial stocks with HDFC Bank, HDFC, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank and Axis Bank accounting most of the index’s fall, BSE data showed. The session also left investors poorer by nearly Rs 3.6 lakh crore, with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 119 lakh crore.One of the reasons for the sharp fall in the sensex is the continuous selling by foreign funds, market players said. In five sessions since Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan on May 12 night, FPIs have net sold stocks worth about Rs 9,100 crore, or around $1.1 billion, official data showed. Prior to that in this month, the market had recorded net inflows of about $2.8 billion till May 12.75817084One of the reasons for the wave of FPI outflows is that foreign brokerages have been critical of the government’s economic and fiscal stimulus packages worth about Rs 20 lakh crore. Bernstein, one of the leading foreign brokerages, questioned the finance minister’s approach to the stimulus, saying it was not clear if the FM’s aim was to boost the economy or reach the Rs 20-lakh-crore milestone.“While the package started on important aspects, the need to announce measures that add up to this top-down number made the entire package aimless, with several generic announcements, which should ideally have been a part of a normal economic agenda. Overall, we see it as a lost opportunity,” the Bernstein report said.“The plan, in our view, was a general economic agenda and lacked substantive decisions to support consumption, promote manufacturing …while urban and corporates (irrespective of impacts) were ignored. We believe that equity markets are likely to be less enthused with the package as it is less likely to support the economy in the near/ medium term,” it said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-tanks-1000-points-as-d-st-turns-cautious-on-stimulus/articleshow/75817082.cms

It relies on NFC (Near Field Communication) enabled tag for payment. The solution also saves both time and effort. While the second method includes inserting the card in the POS machine yourself.

The bank is also looking at raising Rs 15,000 crore through another round of equity issue.The private bank’s share price closed nearly 7% higher at Rs 28 on Thursday after hitting the upper circuit intraday. The bank’s share price rose after it announced that its post-tax loss of Rs 3,668 crore turned into a profit of Rs 2,629 crore, adding a one-time gain from writing off its liabilities towards its additional tier-1 bonds.Speaking to TOI, MD & CEO Prashant Kumar said that the bank has made provisioning of over 74% towards bad loans and stressed investments. Any provisions in future would be on account of Covid or economic slowdown.“Now the stressed asset portfolio has a 74% provision coverage, there is no pressure. We can segregate it within the bank in a separate subsidiary, or if a bad bank is created, then the remaining bank looks very attractive with NPAs of less than 0.5%,” said Kumar. He added that there was huge interest from stressed asset funds who are interested in both — investments in the assets as well as capital of the company and taking over management. Kumar said that the bank was currently compliant with the RBI’s norms on capital adequacy, with tier-1 capital of nearly 6.5%. “We would like to have a buffer of 200 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) for future accounts. Also, we want to raise enough to meet our targeted growth of 10%. If we raise around Rs 15,000 crore, we would not need to come to the market for three years,” said Kumar. He added that it was looking at raising equity from new investors including global funds. However, existing investors could pick up additional shares if they wished.According to Acuite Ratings & Research chief analytical officer Suman Chowdhury, Yes Bank will need to raise additional capital in the order of Rs 5,000-10,000 crore in the near term to not only meet the regulatory requirements but also to absorb the incremental losses for the current year. “The ability to raise Capital 2.0 from existing or new investors within defined timelines and continued regulatory support for such equity mobilisation efforts will be the key to the sustainability of the bank. While the reported NPAs have declined in Q4 due to write-offs and the provisioning cover is healthy at 74%, there are significant risks of further slippages in the corporate portfolio post the end of the Covid moratorium,” said Chowdhury.Carving out the NPAs would enable Yes Bank to position itself as a retail tech-savvy bank, said Kumar. He added that all the digital players, including PhonePe, who partnered other banks during the moratorium have returned to Yes Bank.Yes Bank does not have any plans to engage in a cost-cutting exercise on the HR front. “So today, I am not shedding my workforce, but it doesn’t mean that my workforce will continue to do what they were doing earlier,” said Kumar. He added that employees in the corporate office might be used for business division, analytics or customer calls.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/yes-bank-plans-bad-bank-eyes-rs-15k-cr-capital-raise/articleshow/75610739.cms
ICICI,2020-05-06T10:02:00+05:30,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,How you can use your debit/credit card safely without the fear of getting infected,"First method is using the ‘Tap and Pay’ feature. It is a proximity payment solution that replaces cash, card or vouchers to make a payment. ","The coronavirus outbreak has taught us to be extra careful about our hygiene safety - both indoors and outdoors. Wearing a mask and washing hands constantly are key ways to protect oneself from the infection. If you are worried about risking your safety while using credit or debit cards for making purchases, then ICICI Bank has some tips. In a post on the microblogging platform Twitter, the bank has shared a small 30-second video that shows ways to use a debit/credit card safely and minimize the risk of infection. First method is using the ‘Tap and Pay’ feature. It is a proximity payment solution that replaces cash, card or vouchers to make a payment. Users simply need to tap the card on the POS machine. It relies on NFC (Near Field Communication) enabled tag for payment. The solution also saves both time and effort.While the second method includes inserting the card in the POS machine yourself. This will eliminate any indirect contact with the person at the POS counter, thus reducing the risk of being infected as well as spreading it. The third way is to use alcohol-based sanitizers to clean hands after making every payment.Here’s the link to the post shared by ICICI Bank on its official Twitter handle.Here's how you can use your #ICICIBank credit/debit card safely while staying protected. #StaySafeBankOnUs https://t.co/D2dH6vcDEZ— ICICI Bank (@ICICIBank) 1588594106000In a related news, the bank recently sent a warning email to its customers against the KYC fraud. It says that the fraudsters, impersonating as bank authorities, are contacting the general public in regard to Know Your Customers (KYC) norms.

The crash of 2,002 points to 31,715 by close of Monday’s trade was the index’s fourth biggest single-session loss ever.The news about extension of the countrywide lockdown, which is going to further affect economic activity, also weighed on investor sentiment, market players said. On the NSE, the Nifty closed at 9,294, down 567 points or 5.7% on the day.The day’s slide also left investors poorer by Rs 5.8 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 122.6 lakh crore. End of the session data showed that both domestic and foreign institutions were sellers with FPIs recording a net outflow of Rs 1,374 crore, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 1,662 crore.According to HDFC Securities head (retail research) Deepak Jasani, Monday’s crash in the Indian bourses could be attributed to the weakness in global markets over the last two trading sessions, poor macro data locally, the latest US-China trade spat and poor corporate earnings. The slide in the global markets could also be because of the spat between top US and Chinese officials “over the origin of the coronavirus”. This fuelled fears of a new trade war, Jasani wrote in a note. In addition, factory data from around the world points to tough times ahead for the global economy, which also pushed investors to be cautious. Financials and IT stocks were hammered the most with 28 of the 30 sensex constituents closing in the red, BSE data showed. HDFC Bank, HDFC, ICICI Bank and Infosys together contributed to the sensex’s fall, while gains in Bharti Airtel cushioned it, although marginally. The selloff in stocks also had a negative impact on the forex market with the rupee closing 62 paise weaker at 75.72 to the dollar, market players said.Technically, continuous closes below the 9,400 level would be a sign of weakness for the Nifty, chartists said. And a hold below 9,400 zones (for Nifty) could see a correction towards 9,000, and then 8,800 zones in the coming days. On the upside, immediate resistance is now placed at 9,600 and then around 9,889 levels, a technical note from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-dives-2002-points-on-pmis-historic-low-global-cues/articleshow/75543316.cms

Assam Oil, registered in England, is the holding company of Assam Company India (Assam India), registered in India, the first tea company in the world. Assam Oil owns 38% of Assam India and has no other business other than this shareholding.Bought by K K Jajodia in early 1990s, Kolkata-based Assam India manages 14 tea estates, and is involved in oil and gas exploration.Only $10 million of the $63 million loan was repaid, thus breaching the 2007 facility agreement, ICICI states in its claim. That agreement was amended in 2011 with a new principal sum of $53 million. That has also not been repaid, ICICI claimed. So the bank is suing Assam Oil as well as two co-guarantors on the loan, namely AIL Holding in Guernsey and Cromwell Securities in Mauritius, which holds 49% shares of Gujarat Hydrocarbons and Power SEZ. Neither guarantor has paid back any sum.Assam Oil now owes ICICI UK $73.5 million including interest, the court heard.In its defence filed with the court in June 2018, Assam Oil claims Aditya Jajodia and his late father then 78, K K Jajodia, received phone calls at 2 am India time from staff from both ICICI UK and ICICI India, including the country head of ICICI UK — before the 2011 agreement was agreed — threatening to “sell the Jajodia shares” in Assam India and “take over the company.” One caller at 11 pm said “You can’t avoid me” and another said “I want your house” and “We will sue you in your personal capacity. We will call you to London.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-uk-sues-assam-oil-for-73-5-million/articleshow/68300542.cms

Private equity major Warburg Pincus may bring in Rs 150-200 crore. “The final allocations by various investors could change after the board’s decision,” said one of the sources mentioned earlier. “The capital coming in will be locked in for a year since it’s a preferential allotment.”The talks come after IDFC First informed stock exchanges on Tuesday that its board will meet on Friday to consider a preferential issue without disclosing details. Emailed queries to IDFC First Bank, IDFC, ICICI Prudential and Warburg Pincus did not elicit a response till the time of going to the press. The development comes as several banks are expected to shore up capital in the coming months. While Kotak Mahindra Bank has announced a $1-billion capital-raise, reports have said that IndusInd Bank is also in talks with PE firms for a new round. IDFC Bank and non-banking finance company Capital First combined after the collapse of a $12-billion merger deal between IDFC and Shriram Group — one of the most ambitious M&A deals in the Indian financial services industry — in late 2017. Some minority IDFC shareholders sought better pricing after Shriram offered Rs 60 apiece for the parent and around Rs 48 for the bank. IDFC First Bank was formed in December 2018, led by Capital First’s V Vaidyanathan. Interestingly, Vaidyanathan, who had earlier led ICICI Bank’s retail business, was also the CEO of ICICI Prudential before the management buyout of Capital First with Warburg Pincus in 2012. The RBI expects the parent IDFC to retain 40% in the bank for five years. The banking licence granted in the second half of 2015 is nearing the five-year-old threshold.Since the merger, IDFC First has been looking to increase its retail footprint and bring down the share of infrastructure loans. While the retail loan book has increased from 36% to 49% of total funded assets since the merger, infrastructure and whole loan book are being reduced. IDFC First has also kept Rs 3,487 crore of assets on a watch-list, out of which Rs 2,253 crore are in infrastructure. The IDFC First Bank stock fell by nearly 1% to Rs 22 on Wednesday, while IDFC closed down 1.2% at Rs 14.5.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-pru-idfc-may-back-idfc-firsts-rs-2000cr-issue/articleshow/75459379.cms

The sensex, after a strong opening on the hopes of a robust monetary stimulus from the RBI, witnessed some profit-taking in mid-session. However, it rose again in late session, mainly on the back of the central bank’s series of measures aimed at supporting the battered economy and partially due to short-covering by speculators, and closed at 31,589 points, up 986 points or 3.2% on the day. The day’s rally, that came on the back of local buying as foreign funds were net sellers at nearly Rs 1,400 crore, added about Rs 2.75 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 122.8 lakh crore.Strong buying in ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank, along with index heavyweight RIL accounted for nearly 60% of the sensex’s gains, BSE data showed. On the other hand, most of the pharma and FMCG stocks, which witnessed good buying in the last few weeks, saw some profit-booking and closed lower.According to Lav Chaturvedi, ED & CEO, Reliance Securities, RBI’s prompt booster for the economy through a slew of measures lifted investor sentiment since these steps are expected to bring the economy back to normalcy. “RBI’s announcement of TLTRO 2.0, mainly for NBFCs and refinancing companies, 25bps cut in reverse repo rate, increase in Ways and Means Advances limits, asset classification standstill and relaxation in NBFCs’ loan to commercial real estate projects are seen as proactive steps to support the economy to move to normalcy,” Chaturvedi said.On the sectoral front, banking index rose the most, followed by strong gains in finance, real estate, energy and consumer discretionary indices.

Sources said that ICICI Bank has asked operating offices to seek a waiver from their landlords as a measure of support to the bank, given the disruption caused by Covid-19. Other private lenders are also seeking waivers.ICICI Bank has nearly 5,300 branches and over 15,000 ATMs across the country and a large number of them are on rented premises. Waiver of even a month’s rent would enable the bank to save several crores. According to the bank’s annual report, it spent nearly Rs 1,200 crore in rent, electricity and taxes. The bank did not respond to a query from TOI.“If the agreement has a force majeure clause which provides for waiver of rent during that period, then the tenant would have the right to invoke that clause and seek a waiver of the rent for that period,” said Rohit Shetty, a senior advocate specialising in real estate laws. If there is no such clause, the parties would have to abide by the terms of the agreement. “If the tenant wants to renegotiate, they can make a proposal, but it is up to the landlord to accept or not,” said Shetty.According to Kunal Moktan, co-founder and CEO of Property Share Capital, a lockdown cannot be constituted as a force majeure, particularly when banks have been functioning and using premises for their IT systems, which have remained operational. “While one can understand retail establishments wanting to negotiate since revenues are directly linked to the store, it is unfair for offices not to pay. Ultimately, landlords also need to meet their obligations to employees, contractors and vendors,” he added.

Truec","NEW DELHI: Some Truecaller users in India woke up to a surprise message this morning. After an overnight update, the Truecaller app automatically started to register users for UPI services without asking for permission from users before starting the process. Truecaller offers UPI services through its partner ICICI Bank. The UPI registration process got initiated irrespective of whether the particular Truecaller user is an ICICI Bank account holder or not. This is because for using UPI services of a particular bank, you are not required to have a bank account with that bank. For example, you might have an account with HDFC Bank but still can register with ICICI Bank UPI account through Truecaller app. In order to automatically start the UPI registration process, the Truecaller app had quietly sent an encrypted message to ICICI Bank to which the users got an SMS from ICICI Bank which said “Your registration for UPI app has started.” On seeing this message, users who had little idea of what might have happened in the background, contacted the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and their respective bank customer support fearing that their bank accounts were compromised. Truecaller users across India took to social media to complain about the issue as they feared that they might lose money via UPI account transfers. Later in the day, Truecaller admitted that there was a bug in the latest update of the app which caused the glitched and requested users to manually unregister from the UPI services within the app. “We have discovered a bug in the latest update of Truecaller that affected the payments feature, which automatically triggered a registration post updating to the version. This was a bug and we have discontinued this version of the app so no other users will be affected. We're sorry about this version not passing our quality standards. We've taken quick steps to fix the issue, and already rolled out a fix in a new version. For the users already affected, the new version with the fix will be available shortly, however, in the meanwhile they can choose to manually deregister through the overflow menu in the app,” said Truecaller in a statement.In 2017, Truecaller had announced a partnership with ICICI Bank to allow users to instantly create UPI ID, send money to any UPI ID or a mobile number registered with the BHIM app. It also enables users to recharge their mobile number from within the Truecaller app itself.

In these unprecedented times, a number of companies are keeping their promise to honour offers made to campus hires. Among these are technology and IT firms including Google, Cisco, Capgemini, TCS, Accenture, Wipro and Cognizant. And others such as Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Godrej, PepsiCo, Biocon, consultancy firms Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey, and Bain & Company, and banking biggies Kotak Mahindra, ICICI Bank, Citi and Axis Bank.Megha Chawla, partner at Bain & Company, said she expects a solid bounce back once the lockdowns are lifted and hence she doesn’t see any change to the company’s campus hiring. “It’s very much per plan and aggressive, keeping an optimistic mid-term perspective,” she said.Google, which usually hires 60-70 from campuses every year, is on track to onboard all new recruits. TCS and Wipro are hiring 30,000 and 12,000 respectively this financial year. Cognizant is keeping its word on onboarding 20,000 freshers this fiscal, but it said the onboarding dates will depend on various factors, including the actual completion of the academic programme and the business impact of the ongoing lockdown.Capgemini India CEO Ashwin Yardi said the firm hired more than 6,000 in the quarter ended March, including 2,000 freshers and 4,000 laterals. He said there is no deferment in the joining dates. For the second quarter, it has rolled out offers to more than 4,000 lateral hires and will onboard all of them.Cisco has onboarded over 100 candidates virtually since March 15. Anupam Trehan, director, people and communities, Cisco India & Saarc, said, “During these unprecedented times, it is key for organisations to operate from a ‘people first’ stance.”HUL onboarded 101 interns — from the top 15 business schools, including the IIMs, Narsee Monjee Institute of Management, and Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies — in the first week of April. Anuradha Razdan, executive director (HR), HUL, said the company pivoted the whole plan and proactively reached out to the institutes, who were also in a state of uncertainty because a number of recruiters had gone back on their programmes. “We said we will go ahead and deliver a 100% signature HUL experience virtually. Projects which required extensive fieldwork were tweaked slightly,” she said.Godrej has hired 64 summer interns from 13 institutions, including Delhi School of Economics, IIM-Ahmedabad and IIM-Calcutta. Sumit Mitra, head - group HR in Godrej Industries and associate companies, said the internship will run online, with students working from home, in order to ensure safety. Mitra said this may not give students the full experience, so the company may look at offering an additional shorter on-ground immersion later in the year once it’s safer to do so. Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said the company would honour all the 250 job offers made. “We have onboarded 90 people virtually and they will physically join us once the lockdown is lifted. We have not pushed back joining dates for any,” she said.PepsiCo has honoured all offers towards new hires, and is currently virtually onboarding the 11 summer interns it had made commitments to.Rahul Guha, MD and head of recruiting at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) India, said they are honouring the 150-200 campus offers made. ICICI Bank will honour all the offers made, as also on-board summer interns from B-schools on April 6 through a virtual induction programme. Sukhjit Pasricha, president & group CHRO in Kotak Mahindra Bank, said they will honour all campus offers, but there could be a slight delay on account of the lockdown. Rajkamal Vempati, EVP & HR head in Axis Bank, said the bank has this year hired over 1,000 management graduates, CAs, engineers and graduates in new-age skills like data sciences, risk management, design thinking and information security.Shweta Mehrotra, CHRO in Citi South Asia, said the bank is committed to providing roles to 400 full-time analysts from engineering schools and 54 analysts from the country’s top business schools between June and August this year. This number, she said, is similar to its previous years’ campus hiring and there is no change to this plan.(With inputs from Mayur Shetty)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/many-large-cos-will-honour-hiring-pledge/articleshow/75130399.cms

Earlier in January, TOI reported saying Bansal would allocate most of his fortune from sale of his Flipkart stake to Walmart in his new venture. Bansal’s investment in Navi earlier this month included Rs 253 crore in cash, Rs 1,636 crore of debt papers of multiple companies and transfer of his stake in microfinance firm Chaitanya Rural Intermediation Development Services (CRIDS), whose subsidiary Chaitanya India Fin Credit has applied for a banking license.To strengthen his banking application prospects, Bansal, who had started Flipkart in 2007,has also got Nachiket Mor -- former RBI director and top ICICI Bank executive, as a board member of the firm. Meanwhile, Bansal has acquired DHFL Insurance and Essel Mutual Fund for a wider play in insurance and asset management.

The firms had taken loans from ICICI Bank and had defaulted on instalments due in January and February 2020. They will have to pay the January instalment within 15 days of the lockdown being lifted and the February instalment within a further period of three weeks. Their counsel Birendra Saraf had sought orders to restrain ICICI Bank from declaring their accounts and facilities as NPA. His plea was period of moratorium from March 1 to May 31 be excluded while computing 90 days provided by law before declaring a defaulter as an NPA.With covid-19 and lockdowns directed by government, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had provided a moratorium from March 1 to May 31. For any instalment due after March 1, the moratorium fully applies. The question before the HC was if there was a default that triggered the beginning of a countdown for the 90-days to NPA declaration, would the countdown timer stop on March 1, 2020 and resume only after lockdown or moratorium ends?Saraf argued that the entire moratorium period must be excluded, else he moratorium itself would be meaningless. But ICICI Bank counsel Virag Tulzapurkar opposed this and said, “broad-based declaration…by a Court could have all manner of unintended consequences in respect of other borrowers...''Tulzapurkar argued that the moratorium was not available to instalments which fell due prior to 1/3/20. Justice Patel in a 30-page order, said “the whole of the moratorium period is, evidently, excluded for all amounts that fall due during that moratorium period.’’ ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dont-use-lockdown-time-in-moratorium-to-declare-npas/articleshow/75113293.cms

At end of trading, the sensex was up 3,569 points — or nearly 13%.

The bank would deploy employees with devices in sourcing locations to enable a customer to fill in the details and obtain an instant sanction or get a top-up loan in their account immediately.“When we have already done a credit scoring of the customer and his bank statements and estimation of income, what value addition a personal interaction can do? We don’t want them to wait for an income statement and then obtain a bank statement printout from our branch and hand it over to the home loan department,” said ICICI Bank executive director Anup Bagchi.He added that the value addition can come from helping the customer in finding property from among the bank’s 30,000 projects.An instant top-up loan is feasible as the bank already has the security of the mortgage. Often there is headroom to lend more either because the borrower has taken a lower loan than he is eligible to or having repaid the loan he can borrow afresh. According to Bagchi, these loans are useful when borrowers renovate their homes or refurbish them after purchase.The bank has also grown the number of its mortgage sourcing offices by 50% to 1,500 in FY19 in a bid to achieve its target of Rs 2 lakh crore home loan portfolio by March 2020. ICICI Bank’s home loan portfolio at Rs 1.7 lakh crore has grown 19% year-on-year as on December 31, 2018. Home loans accounted for about 88% of the bank’s total retail portfolio.Retail loans are 59% of the bank’s total advances.

Most lenders plan to send o,"MUMBAI: Banks will soon come out with the operational procedure for retail borrowers to avail a three-month moratorium on their loans. Most lenders plan to send out text messages and emails allowing borrowers to avail the facility, while some have already done so.State Bank of India said that its technical team was working on the RBI circular and giving an option may take some time as this requires changes in current systems and procedures. The bank told customers that if an EMI was debited and they wish to avail the moratorium, they can contact the branch to initiate the refund process. ICICI Bank sources said that it was working late into the night to create a channel to give an option to customers. 74922212 On Monday, banks had a video-conference under the Indian Banks Association, where it was decided that the option has to be rolled out to all borrowers. HDFC, the country’s largest housing finance company, said that it would start sending out options to borrowers on whether to avail of the moratorium or not. Lenders across the board stressed the point that the moratorium was not a waiver of interest and that the interest for the three months would be recovered from the borrower. They also stressed that borrowers whose cash flows were unaffected should continue to repay their instalments as always. 74921489 Meanwhile, to reassure borrowers, a host of public sector banks took to social media to say that a moratorium would be made available. Bank of Baroda said that it was providing the moratorium on all instalments falling due between March 1 to May 31 for all term loans, including corporate, medium and small enterprises. “EMIs of housing loans, vehicle loans, MSME loans and payment of all other term loans falling due after March 1 and up to May 31 have been deferred by 3 months,” Syndicate Bank said. UCO Bank told borrowers that it has granted moratorium of three instalments of term loans up to May 31. “The next instalment is now payable in June 2020. Your repayment schedule will be extended accordingly,” the bank said.Central Bank of India indicated in a tweet that the moratorium will be given to all. “Three months deferment is automatic & customers need not approach bank for the same,” the bank said. “However, customers may approach the bank to change the standing instructions or any other mandate given by them for payment of their loan instalment. Interest will accrue in loan accounts but no penal interest. March 20 instalment already paid will be automatically appropriated towards next EMI due, that is for June 20,” the tweet said.

Lenders said that it was taking long as some of the matters had to be referred to board-level committees to enforce. Lenders said that they were seeking clarification from the RBI on whether it was necessary to recover interest from business immediately at the end of three months as mentioned in the central bank’s circular. “If we postpone for only three months and seek recovery immediately after that, it would be a burden on the borrower,” said a bank chief.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-to-roll-out-emi-waiver-options-soon/articleshow/74921490.cms

Meanwhile, in a statement issued on Friday, Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd denied any CBI search at any of its premises. CBI officials said Kapoor had conspired with other accused for illegal gratification of Rs 307 crore when he purchased a bungalow at Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi from Thapar's Avantha Realty for Rs 378 crore. The CBI claimed its market price was Rs 685 crore.Kapoor had purchased the bungalow through Bliss Abode, where his wife is a director. Immediately after the purchase, Rana mortgaged the bungalow to Indiabulls for a loan of Rs 685 crore for Bliss Abode.In its FIR, the CBI stated that Kapoor had paid Rs 378 crore-a lower than market price-for the bungalow to Avantha Realty. In lieu of that, Yes Bank relaxed terms for its existing loans to Avantha Group companies and even advanced fresh loans to them. Yes Bank had extended Rs 2,500-crore credit facilities to Avantha Group companies. Avantha group companies obtained credit facilities of Rs 350 crore from ICICI Bank and Rs 30 crore from Development Credit Bank (DCB) against collateral security of the bungalow spread over 1.2 acres. ln the ICICI loan, the bungalow's valuation was shown as Rs 550 crore in 2016.Yes Bank sanctioned Rs 400 crore loan to Avatha Realty in March 2016 as lease rental discounting for a period of 10 years. Avantha Realty was not eligible for the loan as it already had outstanding liabilities with Yes Bank. The Rs 400-crore loan was utilized to repay the outstanding loans of ICICI Bank and DCB Bank taken by Avantha Realty.Avatha Realty entered into a lease rental agreement of the bungalow with its other group companies showing rent of Rs 65 crore a year. The agreement was executed just two days prior to sanctioning of the loan by Yes Bank. Surprisingly, before the 2016 lease agreement, another Avantha Group company was paying Rs 1.02 crore annual rent for the bungalow. The CBI alleged that the Avantha Group increased the rent intentionally to deceive Yes Bank to make the loan approval look justifiable without any reasonable basis.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cbi-files-another-cheating-case-against-yes-bank-founder-his-wife-bizman/articleshow/74624632.cms

The approval is subject to the condition that the public-sector lender’s holding will remain within 49% of the paid-up capital of Yes Bank.While the amount is higher than the Rs 2,450 crore indicated earlier in the RBI’s draft plan, it is lower than the Rs 10,000 crore that SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had said that the bank was willing to infuse in the troubled private lender.Also, if the purchase of 725 crore shares is intended to help SBI acquire a 49% stake, the total capital-raising is unlikely to be more than Rs 15,000 crore. The paid-up capital could go higher than Rs 15,000 crore if SBI allows its stake to fall below 49% and other investors — including private banks — pick up a stake of at least 35%.Given that the private lender’s authorised capital has been raised to Rs 5,000 crore by the RBI, Yes Bank can raise an additional Rs 10,000 crore even after SBI’s Rs 7,250-crore investment. Of this, there is a likelihood that Rs 1,750 crore could come from the conversion of additional tier-1 bonds with investors agreeing to the conversion.In its reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank, the RBI said that the investor would need to invest in the equity of the reconstructed bank to the extent that post-infusion it holds 49% at a price of not less than Rs 10 per share of Rs 2.Shares of Yes Bank, which were on the upswing after RBI’s reconstruction plan, slipped 13% on Thursday in line with the global market collapse. Shares of the private lender closed at Rs 25, which values the bank at Rs 6,389 crore — more than twice RBI’s valuation of the private lender under its reconstruction scheme.Besides SBI, private lenders including HDFC group, ICICI Bank group, Kotak Group and private investors like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and R K Damani are expected to participate.Meanwhile, India Ratings in a report said that the delays in resuming normal services could impact the near-term liquidity of some of the bank’s customers. Also, corporate groups with a large dependency on the bank could face a longer period of disruption. “These disruptions could stem from their usage of Yes Bank as a lender for facilities such as cash credit, letters of credit (LCs), bank guarantees (BGs) and other working capital facilities as well as a term debt provider. The moratorium is also likely to impact the liquidity cushion available with many corporates in form of deposits and investments parked with Yes Bank,” India Ratings said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-clears-plan-to-put-rs-7250cr-in-yes-bank/articleshow/74602789.cms

These include peer-to-peer and merchant payments via UPI. Following the Yes Bank shocker, Bengaluru-based PhonePe has now initiated talks with State Bank of India (SBI) to have a multi-bank approach for UPI, two people aware of the matter said. Delhi-based BharatPe too is in talks with Kotak Mahindra Bank as well as SBI. After ICICI Bank came to the rescue on Friday, the Mumbai-based bank now is processing almost 60% of UPI transactions, as it was already working closely with Google Pay, one of the top apps on the platform. Sources also said that the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) played a critical role in emerging out of the Yes Bank crisis in 24 hours.  74542534 “NPCI was constantly monitoring the situation. Yes Bank has given a no-objection certificate to migrate user UPI handles to ICICI Bank till the moratorium is in place. Changes were done after that,” a source said. PhonePe co-founder and CEO Sameer Nigam, as part of his reply to a comment, said on Twitter, “Just never imagined the bank itself going totally dark like this. Lesson learnt in the hardest possible way.” PhonePe also took a hit on its balance sheet as it had to settle payments with merchants via the new nodal account with ICICI Bank, as the money in Yes Bank nodal account remains stuck. The amount which PhonePe had used to settle with its merchants is not known, but it is one of the largest consumer-focused UPI apps, clocking 20 million daily transactions. Nigam, whose PhonePe was hit the most, had to fly down to Mumbai on Friday morning amid one of its worst crises so far.“All our QRs are active now. It was one of the fastest migrations ever done — NPCI was working with us overnight to get this done,” said BharatPe co-founder and CEO Ashneer Grover. BharatPe had 20-30% exposure to Yes Bank for its QR codes. ICICI Bank said that it could manage to respond to the crisis at PhonePe because the bank had an application programming interface, called APIs, ready and systems tested for high-volume transactions during ‘peacetime’, and it also has fraud analytics systems in place. “The bank put together a 40-strong team of legal, operations and technology to avoid having to obtain approvals sequentially. In future, if customers want, the handles would be revised to reflect ICICI Bank domain names,” said ICICI Bank ED Anup Bagchi. Currently, PhonePe users can transact using their existing UPI IDs of Yes Bank — @ybl, as TOI reported in its Saturday edition. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s chief digital officer Deepak Sharma said it is always on the lookout for “mutually beneficial partnerships” without commenting on talks with BharatPe. An email sent to SBI did not elicit any response till the time going to press.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/phonepe-bharatpe-in-talks-with-multiple-banks-to-support-upi/articleshow/74542535.cms

ICICI,2020-03-07T04:00:00+05:30,Digbijay Mishra,"Yes Bk crisis: UPI’s use dives 40%, PhonePe lines go dead",India Business News: Digbijay.,"Digbijay.Mishra@timesgroup.comBengaluru: An unexpected fallout of the Reserve Bank of India’s moratorium on Yes Bank was a disruption of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) offered by fintech firms, which accounts for the bulk of digital transactions in the country. UPI transactions were down by about 40% on Friday, largely because PhonePe — which sees 20 million transactions a day — could not operate as it is plugged into Yes Bank to provide UPI-based account-to-account transfer services. Peer-to-peer payments, online merchant payments, and in-store QR code-based payments were some of the services that were hit.Late Friday night, a PhonePe spokesperson told TOI that peer-to-peer UPI transactions were back. A source said that the RBI and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) have allowed PhonePe to switch to ICICI Bank even as it lets users retain the Yes Bank UPI IDs after migration. This was crucial as current norms mandate customer consent before changing the UPI handle. PhonePe will finish the migration for merchant payments in coming days. In January, Yes Bank processed 39% of the 1.3 billion UPI transactions in the country. This was because PhonePe clocked around 570 million transactions, and most of it came from UPI. Other tech platforms that used Yes Bank, such as food delivery application Swiggy and B2B commerce player Udaan, also saw failures earlier on Friday in their UPI payments option. PhonePe parent Flipkart group and MakeMyTrip group platforms have partnerships with Yes Bank for UPI payments, which were affected. PhonePe, which hitherto relied only on Yes Bank to provide UPI identities to customers, was forced to accelerate talks with ICICI Bank to use its services. There is no indication when all the services will be restored.The PhonePe outage also divided the fintech industry, with Paytm engaging in guerrilla marketing, sending out messages to customers that said, ‘Payments app not working? Switch to Paytm’. This was followed by Paytm and PhonePe exchanging heated messages on their official Twitter handles.Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said this (PhonePe’s unavailability) is a lesson and reminder that the NPCI should not allow such apps to depend solely on one bank. “This is a lesson and reminder that NPCI should only allow payment service providers who are issuing handles on behalf of multiple banks, not just one. It should also not allow more than a 33% market share for any single payments application. This is an example of how over-dependence between a few players can send things into a tailspin,” he said.While Paytm owns a bank, Google Pay, another third-party UPI app, works with four banks to issue UPI handles.Besides the app-based payments, there was an impact on in-store UPI payments through QR codes. BharatPe, which enables merchants to receive payment from any UPI app, has put a fleet-on-ground team to replace QR-codes with those issued by ICICI Bank. While PhonePe has 10 million merchants, BharatPe has 4 million. BharatPe’s founder and CEO Ashneer Grover said about 20% of its QR-codes are by Yes Bank and rest were moved to ICICI Bank over the last six months. “We have sent our team to merchant locations to replace existing Yes Bank QR-codes,” he added.

She sought their restoration but ICICI refused the request and said her petition now was a ""concerted strategy… to avoid making any payments to it under clawback provisions.""A bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Makarand Karnik heard the matter and swiftly decided the issue. In its judgment pronounced on Thursday it said, ""The termination of the petitioner (Kochhar) is in the realm of contractual relationship.""It said, ""ICICI Bank is a private body. It is not an instrumentality of the State. It receives no public funding. Service conditions of the ptitioner (Kochhar) are not governed by any statute. The dispute raised in this petition arises from a contract of personal service.""Significantly, the HC said that ""Section 35B(1)(b) of Banking Regulation Act does not regulate service conditions between an employer and employee."" It said ""approval for termination under it does not adjudicate the rights of the petitioner as an employee.""The HC said, ""Though the section postulates that the termination would not come into effect if there is no prior approval of the Reserve Bank…legal implications of the approval …would be grounds and arguments in the contractual dispute."" Merely questioning the RBI nod doesn’t infuse a public law element to the dispute, said the HC.The HC thus upheld the ""preliminary objection raised"" by ICICI Bank and RBI.The HC emphasised that ""When employments in a private entity is regulated by contracts, the courts do not to exercise the writ jurisdiction.""""Courts exercise writ jurisdiction when a public law element involved, if the services are governed by a statute.""For that purpose the nature of the concerned enactment and its purpose and scope has to be ascertained.""The grant of approval by Reserve Bank does not mean that the action of termination is valid in terms of the service dispute,"" said the HC and elaborating on the scope of section 351 (1)(B) of the banking regulation act said that it ""is enacted to examine the situation post termination, that is, its impact on the larger banking interest.""""The predominant object of conferment of power on the Reserve Bank is the interest of banking policy.

Risk-averse investors turned to gold, which hit a lifetime high of Rs 43,250 per 10gm in Mumbai (for 99.5 purity). The gold price for 99.9 purity was Rs 49,500.The 30-share index fell 807 points, or nearly 2%, to close at 40,363. The fall in equities was led by stocks of automobiles, pharmaceuticals and consumer durables over fears of disruption of supplies from China, which accounts for 14% of India’s imports. In the foreign currency markets, the rupee fell 34 paise to close at a more than three-month low of 72 against the dollar, as there was flight to safety. In Europe, early trades saw Britain’s FTSE 100 fall nearly 3.5%, while the CAC 40 in Paris as well as Germany’s DAX lost almost 4%. The Dow Jones was down nearly 3% after opening on Monday but slipped further by over 1,000 points (see graphic). South Korea’s Kospi fell 3.9% with 231 new cases of the virus being reported on Monday. Earlier in the day, Sydney’s ASX/200 lost 2.3% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.8%. Auto companies, represented in the BSE auto index, were hit the most with the index declining 3.3% on fears of disruption of supplies from China. Tata Motors and Eicher Motors were down 5%, and so were Maruti Suzuki (4.2%), Hero MotoCorp (2.5%) and Mahindra & Mahindra (2.2%). “Headline indices are down around 2% across all market cap categories, suggesting that the broad-based sell-off is largely in response to weakness in sentiment across the region and spilling over into European trading,” said Emkay Global Financial Services head (sales trading) S Hariharan. “News around the spread of the coronavirus and its concomitant impact on trade and activity levels have been the strongest driver of daily moves in the last few sessions and would continue to be a major factor. The auto sector has been the worst hit over the last two weeks, driven primarily by concerns on supply chain disruptions,” he added.Banks were hit hard over fears of fresh non-performing assets with the government digging in its heels over its demand for adjusted gross revenue dues from telecom companies. ICICI Bank was down 3% and Axis Bank 2.4%. “We believe new forms of stress are emerging (for banks).

As a share certificate changed hands, the transactions were recorded on the certificate itself. In dematerialised shares, transfers are documented, but the absence of a unique identity made it possible for Karvy to pledge clients’ shares, held in its account, as if they were its own. Both Sebi and the NSE are currently probing this fraud.Karvy had pledged shares with Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and others to raise funds. It owes Bajaj Finance as much as Rs 300 crore.“In the physical era, every share had three numbers — certificate numbers and a distinctive number which were unique to that company share, and the folio number, which marked the ownership.The new owner’s folio number would be recorded on the reverse of the certificate after every transaction,” said a Sebi official, aware of the discussions.Sources said Sebi could look at employing decentralised ledgers like blockchain or hashgraphs for maintaining historical records of the unique ids for shares.“After demat, shares — like currency — became untraceable. If unique certificate numbers had been in existence, Karvy could have never pledged its clients’ shares as its own without the banks noticing,” said the official. Of some 95,000 affected clients, Karvy returned securities of nearly 83,000 clients. Now lenders have appealed, claiming a lien on the shares.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-eyes-unique-ids-for-shares-to-tackle-karvy-type-frauds/articleshow/74250840.cms

Management ex","MUMBAI: In a major HR shift, ICICI Bank has flattened its top management by getting rid of all grades of deputy general manager (GM) and above. Management executives are now known by their role and there are no grade-based benefits. The bank has also got rid of all symbols of hierarchy — no longer can anyone guess an executive’s seniority based on the size of his car or access to the executive dining room.69380648 This is a big shift for a bank where even the internet bandwidth earlier depended on seniority. The move will impact over 400 executives of the level of deputy GM, joint GM, GM and senior GMs. This is the first major change in HR policy since Sandeep Bakhshi took charge as CEO last year.“We have recently reorganised ourselves to work together seamlessly across functional and departmental boundaries in order to maximise our share of market opportunities. We have moved to role-based designations from grade-based structures and empowered our teams at the local level,” Bakhshi told analysts recently.“If we have to be agile and nimble-footed, we cannot remain a hierarchical organisation. Because of the grades, these structures and levels got hard-coded and there was a sense of hierarchy,” said group HR chief T K Srirang. Following the shift, the bank will have the flexibility to move an erstwhile deputy GM into a role that used to earlier be filled in by a senior GM.“This has given us the opportunity to move younger people and give them roles ahead of time,” he said. Business heads will have more flexibility as their power and authority would be related to the role. Earlier, a GM who headed a region would have higher sanctioning authority than a deputy GM in same role.The other impact for employees is that there will be no automatic promotion based on the period of service. “In any organisation in India, there is an expectation that every three-four years there would be a promotion. Now, instead of sitting in the same role and aspiring for a higher role, executives will have to aspire for a new role to move ahead,” he said. The second big change is that business has been organised around a ‘customer ecosystem’. What this means is that for a set of customers, there would be a head with a composite target to offer multiple products from different verticals.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-junks-ranks-scraps-exec-symbols/articleshow/69380649.cms

Mercator, once the second-largest private shipping company in India, owes over Rs 50 crore to the banking giant.However, Bank of Baroda and Axis Trusteeship have sought intervention to protect their rights over Mercator’s subsidiary as its assets are pledged to them. The subsidiary owes more than Rs 200 crore to the two financial majors. NCLT will hear the matter on Wednesday. On January 23, the NCLT had said that if Mercator fails to file a reply to ICICI’s insolvency application before February 10, then the matter will be adjudicated on merits. The city-based shipping company’s woes came to the fore when it failed to pay salaries to its crew members last March. To pare liabilities, Mercator has been divesting its assets.

The probe comes even as EY is conducting a forensic audit of KSBL for NSE.MCA sources said RoC has been asked to examine if KSBL, its promoters and officials violated provisions of the Companies Act and committed non-compoundable offences which are punishable by imprisonment.“RoC will look into instances of misrepresentation of facts or misstatements in filing of balance sheets and other necessary documents. It has also been asked to look into the relationship between various Karvy group companies and related party transactions,” said a senior official.“It will also probe if there was any misuse or diversion of funds and will try to find out in what manner the money that KSBL borrowed from banks and financial institutions was utilised,” the source added.Sebi had, in its order dated November 22, 2019, stated that KSBL had prima facie transferred Rs 1,096 crore to its realty company, Karvy Realty, between April 1, 2016, and October 19, 2019.KSBL had pledged securities of around 95,000 clients to raise over Rs 2,300 crore from various banks and financial institutions including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance, Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank among others in violation of Sebi's norms. Sebi had on June 20, 2019, asked all brokers to segregate clients’ funds and securities by September 30, 2019, and report compliance of its order.Sources said MCA may ask regulatory bodies involved in the Karvy scam probe, like Sebi, as well as NSE and EY to share their reports in the matter as part of its investigation.It is learnt that RoC has also been asked to examine the role of auditors in case of any irregularities.Incidentally, this is not the first time that KSBL has run afoul of the stock market watchdog. KSBL was one of the Karvy group entities that was found by Sebi to be involved in the infamous Roopal Panchal IPO scam that rocked the stock market in the mid-2000.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/now-mca-orders-probe-into-karvy/articleshow/73163073.cms

In January, the ED had provisionally attached Kochhars’ assets worth Rs 78 crore in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. The money laundering case is based on a CBI’s FIR against the couple and others for defrauding ICICI Bank by granting loan illegally in lieu of kickback.It is alleged that ICICI Bank then headed by Chanda Kochhar had illegally sanctioned Rs 1,875 crore to Videocon Group companies which afterwards became non-performing assets (NPA) in 2017, causing loss to the bank .During the investigation, ED found an instance, where a committee headed by Chanda Kochhar in ICICI Bank has sanctioned Rs 300 crore loan to Videocon International Electronics Ltd.

ICICI Bank argued that her petition was not maintainable as a writ since there was no plea for enforcement of public duty. He said the bank is a private bank and hers was a contractual dispute for which she cannot seek relief under article 226 for any violation of her fundamental rights. Her amended plea only seeks a declaration that the RBI approval is void and her challenge thus means that she has accepted that there is a “valid existing and binding order of March 13,2019.”The HC will hear the matter next on January 13,2020.But arguing for Kochhar her counsel Vikram Nankani said the issue was only essentially a short point that sans a prior RBI approval as mandated by the rules of appointment and termination of banks’ CEOs, her termination is invalid.She has sought a declaration to hold as valid its letter of last October by which the Bank had already accepted her request for early retirement.ICICI bank said she her “petition is merely a part of a concerted stratagem...to avoid making any payments to it under clawback provisions”. It said that she was only through the petition resorting to seek restoration of contractual benefits such as vested or unvested stock options which stood forfeited in account of her “termination for cause.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-defends-its-nod-to-kochhars-sacking/articleshow/72877500.cms

","MUMBAI: Retail loans will double to Rs 96 lakh crore by March 2024 from Rs 48 lakh crore in March 2019, according to a joint report by ICICI Bank and Crisil. The report said that the retail loan growth will outstrip economic expansion as the ratio of advances like mortgages to GDP will rise on back of rising disposable incomes. Also, a large part of individuals who are without loans are getting credit due to new data that enables lenders to take credit decision.“India’s GDP per capita in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) is now $7,762. Our analysis predicts that this junction will prove to be an inflection point for the country, as it was with another large economy a few years ago. We foresee that in the next five years, the domestic retail loans market is poised to double to Rs 96 lakh crore,” said ICICI Bank executive director Anup Bagchi.According to Bagchi, the other drivers for retail credit would be urbanisation and nuclearisation of families, resulting in increase in demand for consumer goods. “We are also seeing micro nuclearisation happening — people are buying televisions for each room. This is also driving consumption,” said Bagchi. One of the key drivers of retail growth is the mortgage loans market, which is expected to double to Rs 54 lakh crore by FY24. Unsecured loans are also expected to more than double to Rs 13.8 lakh crore.“Growth is expected to be higher in smaller cities outside the top 50. The top five players are foreseen continuing their dominance of the market across asset classes. For example, in housing loans, despite the market having over 100 players, the top five players alone have a cumulative market share of over 50%,” said Crisil chief operating officer and president Amish Mehta.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/retail-loans-to-double-to-rs-96-lakh-crore-by-24-study/articleshow/72860974.cms

The decision to return the shares to about 83,000 investors was part of Sebi’s November 22 order that also banned Karvy Stock Broking from taking new clients.After the decision, Bajaj Finance, as one of the lenders which had lent Rs 345 crore to Karvy Stock Broking against shares, called loan against shares (LAS) in market parlance, had moved Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) to reverse Sebi’s decision relating to return of shares. ICICI Bank that had an outstanding LAS of about Rs 642 crore, HDFC Bank with Rs 208 crore and IndusInd Bank with Rs 159 crore also joined Bajaj Finance with similar pleas.Sebi whole-time member Anant Barua in the 29-page order noted that all the shares were pledged without the consent of the investors, which was a violation of Sebi laws. The order also pointed out that the lenders, while extending LAS to Karvy Stock Broking failed to notice that the account from which the broker pledged all those shares were not marked ‘proprietary account’ and was marked ‘non-house’ , both Sebi requirements for such pledges.The account, from which the shares were pledged, was named ‘Karvy Stock Broking (BSE). “The use of ‘(BSE)’, categorisation of account as ‘non-house’ and absence of the word ‘proprietary’ in the account name should have alerted the ( lenders) for taking further precautions,” the Sebi order pointed out.The order also rubbished the claims of ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank that they, despite being depository participants (DP), were not aware of the categorisation of investor accounts as ‘house’ and ‘non-house’. Bajaj Finance is the only lender among the four that is not a DP. The order also rubbished the claims of the three banks that they were not aware of a Sebi circular dated June 20 2019 that categorically made it mandatory for brokers to segregate shares and securities of their clients and the same of their own. Sebi order also pointed out that the value of shares Karvy Stock Broking had pledged with banks did not match the investments or holdings as shown in its balance sheet. And this should have raised a red flag for the lenders. “In this regard, it is noted a prudent lender always refer to balance sheet for ascertaining the financial position and solvency of the borrower and also the purpose of loan, before lending,” the order pointed out. The Sebi order also said that the remedy for the four lenders against Karvy Stock Broking should be moved before a civil court.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-rejects-karvy-lenders-plea/articleshow/72555529.cms

It continues to be the largest in the pr,"MUMBAI: Nineteen years ago ICICI Prudential Life Insurance sold the first life insurance policy by a private company. It continues to be the largest in the private life insurance space in terms of assets under management. NS Kannan, who was part of the early team in the company, had moved to ICICI Bank in 2008 as chief finance officer. Last year he returned to ICICI Prulife as CEO. In an interview with ToI, he talks about the journey.It is been nearly two decades of opening of life insurance. How has the journey been?We sold our first policy in December 2000 and we have completed 19 years. We are seeing a multi-decade opportunity for saving and protection. Both in savings and protection, India is among the underpenetrated countries. From the risk perspective too, the industry has done well as it has a fairly clean asset profile. This is help by the fact that IRDAI has stipulated a minimum AA- rating for investment in corporate bonds. So, the reason why the industry has done well has been the opportunity and risk profile wise, a cleaner business.How is the risk profile the same for life insurance considering that you have to invest in the same corporate sector?I can speak for ourselves. If we are taking a view on interest rates, we have a very liquid government bond market where we have been overweight. And when it comes to NBFCs we do not have exposure to the assets that have gone through stress. The proof of the pudding is that in 19 years we have had no NPAs. It has been a zero NPA situation for us.So how do you invest your assets. What is the size of your assets under management?Our assets under management is Rs 1,65,512 crore – the largest in the private sector - of which Rs 77,612 crore is in equity and the balance Rs 87,900 crore is in fixed income. Of the fixed income investments 93.6% are in government securities or AAA instruments. These figures are at September 30, 2019. From a product line that was 85% unit-linked we have diversified out portfolio with 65% unit linked plan and the outcome of the asset mix has been necessarily the choice exercised by the customer in unit-linked policies.How do declining interest rates affect your business?Inflation being at manageable levels has favored financial savings over physical savings. The industry has benefited as investors do not have to go for assets like real estate or gold to beat higher inflation. With inflation being low, interest rates have come down which has helped fixed income funds. As rates move down the price of securities increase and the one-year return on income funds has been to the order of 15%. Over a medium term we have been able to achieve a return of approximately 9% for equity and 7% on income.So while the NAV will rise yield on fresh investments in income funds will be lower.Yes, but again customers have the option of switching from one fund to another without any incidence of tax. Also, these kinds of market events and yield movements get evened out in the long-term.The last six seven years have not seen major capital infusion despite growth. Has the life industry become more efficient?I think, the bulk of the investments happened in the early periods of liberalization, and that has helped. Productivity has also drastically improved in the last five years or so. If you look at our company, we were doing around Rs 3,000 crore retail weighted received premium (RWRP) in FY2012, we had a staff strength of around 12,000. Now (FY2019) we are doing around Rs 7,000 crore RWRP with approximately 14000 staff. There has been a huge productivity increase, because the premiums have more than doubled, whereas the increase in employees has been quite marginal. What has helped is what we have done in technology, process and digitization.So you do not need any capital..We have a solvency ratio of 211% as against the statutory requirement of 150%. This is at September 30, 2019. So, we do not foresee any need to raise equity in the foreseeable future. Also, regulator has talked about risk-based capital at some point. Given our product profile my sense is that our economic capital availability will be far higher compared to the current regulatory capital. The industry was forced to become efficient because there was a reset in 2010 in terms of regulations. The capping of charges introduced by the regulator left companies with no choice but to become efficient.Public sector banks are selling their stake in their life insurance ventures. Are you looking at M&A opportunities?For us two criteria will have to be satisfied. One is that if there is an opportunity which will give us a large committed distribution over a period of time, through which we can distribute our products, that would be of interest to us, not just a back book. Secondly, it has to come at acceptable valuation. With these two criteria we have to keep scanning the environment. When it comes to distribution, product is one aspect, second is how well we are able to integrate the systems across the distributor – that is very critical.What has been your approach to innovation?Our approach to innovation has been around making life simpler for customers, employees and distributors. Today our customers are able to avail 80% of the service requirement through the self-serve mode as everything has been made straight through. Similarly, life has been made easier for employees. We have developed a nudge engine which provides employees and distributors the next best product that a customer will find useful. We have been able draw a hierarchy of waiver for financial and medical underwriting based on analytics. We were also among the first to use business certified WhatsApp for servicing customers and sending documents. On the claim side we have started using artificial intelligence in the settlement process.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-look-at-ma-opportunities-only-if-there-is-capability-for-integrated-distribution-icici-prulife-ceo/articleshow/72490941.cms

ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank are some of the major players in the LAS space. ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and some other lenders to Karvy Stock Broking have also joined Bajaj Finance in its plea filed in the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) against the Sebi move of transferring client shares to their individual demat accounts as they no longer have access to the pledged securities.Lenders are taking a two-pronged approach to their LAS books, top bankers and broking house officials said. They, however, declined to speak on record as LAS has become a controversial business in the backdrop of the ban imposed on Karvy Stock Broking by Sebi and the two stock exchanges — NSE and BSE.For one, in cases where banks doubt that securities pledged with them are clients’ securities in contravention of Sebi’s June 20, 2019 circular on handling of client securities, banks are likely to send a recall notice to borrowers. “For LAS facilities, where the brokers are the beneficiaries themselves, there is no issue at all,” said a broking house official.One of the ways that banks and other lenders are checking if a LAS was done properly or not, is by looking at the broker’s balance sheet. If the shares were classified as investments by the broker and the same were pledged, then such LAS do not pose any problem with the lenders. In those cases, the demat account is always in the name of the broker and classified as a proprietary account, a banker said. In those cases where the pledged shares belong to a client of a broker, then the demat account should also be in the name of the client and different from the broker’s. Also, such accounts would be classified as non-proprietary account or a non-house corporate account, the banker pointed out. However, to get around these two tests by bankers, which are aimed at checking the actual ownership of shares put up for LAS, Karvy Stock Broking had opened a demat account in its own name, transferred clients’ shares into this demat account and then pledged the shares from this demat account, the Sebi order against the broker noted.So the cross-checking of a broker’s balance sheet for investments and mapping such investments to particular demat accounts before accepting LAS applications is another level of checking that lenders are putting in place, another broker said. An official with a private sector bank pointed out that with the Karvy Stock Broking crisis coming to light, and given the new Sebi norms on handling of client securities, the size of this business (LAS) will shrink and the demand for this business will also come down.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/karvy-crisis-lenders-tighten-loan-against-share-process/articleshow/72448748.cms

The court has adjourned the hearing to December 18 and asked the RBI to file its reply before that. ICICI Bank terminated Kochhar’s services on January 30, 2019, while the RBI had approved her sacking post facto in March 2019. The counsel for the bank argued that her petition was not maintainable as a writ, since there was no plea for enforcement of public duty. The counsel said the bank was a private entity and Kochhar was in a contractual dispute for which she cannot seek relief under Article 226 of the Companies Act for any violation of her fundamental rights. Her amended plea only seeks a declaration that the RBI approval is void and her challenge thus means that she has accepted that there is a “valid existing and binding order of March 13, 2019”. Arguing for Kochhar, her counsel Vikram Nankani said the issue was “that without a prior RBI approval, as mandated by the rules of appointment and termination of banks’ CEOs, her termination is invalid”.Kochhar has sought a declaration to hold as valid a letter of October 2018 by which the bank had already accepted her request for early retirement.ICICI Bank said her “petition is merely a part of a concerted stratagem ... to avoid making any payments to it under clawback provisions”. The lender said Kochhar, through the petition, is resorting to seek restoration of contractual benefits such as vested or unvested stock options, which stood forfeited on account of her “termination for cause”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hc-issues-notice-to-rbi-in-chanda-kochhar-case/articleshow/72448742.cms

With this step, the regulator has averted a possible PMC Bank-type of crisis, the suspension of the Maharashtra-based cooperative bank that shook the country’s financial system three months ago.According to an NSE investigation of Karvy Broking’s books, over several months, the firm had transferred these securities into its own demat account without the knowledge of its clients and then pledged them with banks and financial institutions to raise funds, a large part of which was pumped into the group’s real estate arm.NSDL said in a statement on Monday that the securities of 82,559 clients, who have paid in full for these securities, were transferred from the broker’s demat account into that of the clients. For the regulator, the logic was that Karvy Stock Broking was never the legal owner of these stocks, but had illegally transferred and pledged them. By this move, unprecedented in the history of India, the actual ownership has been established. These stocks were pledged to six bank accounts: Two of HDFC Bank and one each of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank and IndusInd Bank.“According to the Sebi directions and under supervision of NSE, securities have been transferred from the demat account IN300394-11458979 named Karvy Stock Broking (BSE) to the demat accounts of the respective clients who have paid in full against these securities,” the statement from NSDL said.The Sebi order of November 29 had mentioned that shares of over 95,000 clients of Karvy Stock Broking were misused by the broker. So shares of about 13,000 clients, where legal rights are still to be clearly established, have been put on hold, sources said. Most of these investors traded infrequently. According to data released by NSE, as of October end, Karvy Stock Broking had nearly 2.5 lakh investors, making it the sixth-largest stock broker in the country in terms of number of clients.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nearly-83k-get-back-their-shares/articleshow/72339979.cms

She has sought to add the RBI as a party to her petition and challenge its nod as “illegal” and “void”. A bench of Justices Ranjit More and M S Karnik, however, said it has kept open the bank’s preliminary objections to the maintainability of her petition.Darius Khambata, counsel for the bank, said it was a contractual dispute and since the lender is a private firm and not a public limited company, a writ petition is not maintainable. Vikram Nankani, counsel for Chanda Kochhar — who was not in court but her husband Deepak Kochhar was — argued that under banking regulations, the termination required RBI’s approval. He said that the bank’s affidavit disclosed that the RBI had given its approval for her removal in March 2019, after the January 30 termination. Nankani, who along with Sujay Kantawala appeared for Kochhar, sought to amend the petition to add the RBI as a party and challenge its nod, as “illegal’’ and “void’’. Khambata, however, said such an amendment cannot be permitted. “He can’t argue that by amending and adding the RBI, what was not maintainable suddenly becomes maintainable,” said Khambata.The bank’s case is that the approval by the RBI was in compliance with the law under Section 35B(1)(b) of the Banking Regulations Act, hence her petition must be dismissed. The bank, in its reply, has said that she has “attempted to invoke the HC’s writ jurisdiction under the garb of an alleged violation of section 35B of Banking Regulations Act” and denied that there was in fact, any such violation or non-compliance.The bank said it has on February 3 sought approval from the RBI for the termination and it was granted on March 13. The bench allowed the amendment but said it would hear the bank on maintainability too. Last October, the ICICI Bank had accepted her October 3 plea for early retirement and having accepted her resignation had appointed Sandeep Bakshi as MD and CEO for five years.On January 30, however, the bank terminated her “for cause, in view of pending inquiry”. The bank also then cancelled all her benefits, including those from 2008 to 2019. The benefit amount is estimated to be significantly high. In a letter dated February 1, 2019, the bank informed Kochhar that she was paid over Rs 7 crore as bonus during the period she was CEO since May 2009 and the amount had to be immediately revoked. She challenged her termination as “illegal’’.Kochhar last week approached the Bombay high court to challenge the validity of the bank’s letter of termination. She has sought a declaration to hold as valid its letter of last October by which the bank had already accepted her request for early retirement.Her case now is that once her early retirement was accepted the bank, it cannot terminate and withhold her benefits. Section 35B of the Act stipulates that ‘no appointment or reappointment or termination of the appointment of a chairman, an MD or whole-time director or CEO shall have effect unless …made with the previous approval of the RBI.’’The approval has to be a ‘previous approval’, not after the bank’s decision to terminate, her amended plea says adding that Bakshi’s appointment as with “previous approval from the RBI.’’ The bank’s case is that the RBI approval is legally valid.The HC has posted the matter for hearing on December 9.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hc-allows-kochhar-to-challenge-rbi-nod-on-sacking/articleshow/72339876.cms

It was alleged that the Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm now owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.The allegation of conflict of interest was levelled by whistle blower Arvind Gupta.Interestingly, there are media reports saying the RBI had given her a clean chit in 2016 itself, when the allegations first surfaced.Following the Srikrishna panel report, the bank said it would not treat her leaving the bank as retirement but a termination of her service and also decided to claw back the around Rs 10 crore bonus paid to her between 2009 and March 2018 along with blocking her close to Rs 340 crore of Esops- both a first in the country. She is reportedly planning a legal challenge to both punitive actions.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/chanda-kochhar-case-rbi-says-law-will-take-its-own-course/articleshow/67886547.cms

The theme of 'Energy and Environment' received top billing at IIT Kharagpur's Young Innovators Program 2019, with a majority of the participating school students electing to find their own ways to combat pollution and promote conservation. In its third edition, the contest drew students from Classes VIII-X from schools all over India and abroad to brainstorm on the themes of Health and Cleanliness, Hardware Modelling, Product Designing, Disaster Management,Financial Inclusion, as also Energy and Environment. The grand finale of YIP was held at the IIT Kharagpur campus over three days ending on November 10.The team that walked away with the trophy for 2019 was Team Divyang from KIIT International School, Bhubaneswar. Students Pritesh Deb, Divyan Sahoo and Ankit Pradhan designed a green water dispenser for the use of the differently-abled. Operated by foot or body weight through a simple lever mechanism, the user could use the water to take a shower, water plants or bathe a guide dog.The first runner-up was Team Kriyative Bhavanites from the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavans Public School, Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad.

What was particularly noteworthy of YIP 2019 was not only the fact that girls were members of almost every team, and that the teams hailed from both international schools and district schools of India, but the quality of thought and superior technology that students brought to the table. Several of the teams had worked with Arduino, and some had even used AI to frame solutions to problems.Six teams were selected for the final round and were evaluated for not only the originality of the project ideas and the quality of presentation but also their societal impact.

ICICI,2018-10-04T18:37:00+05:30,PTI,Chanda Kochhar: The fall of a feisty woman who broke the glass ceiling,"India Business News: The 56-year-old Kochhar, who rose to occupy the corner office at the largest private sector lender, was mired in allegations of conflicts of interest,","MUMBAI: In mid-February, a lobby group chose Chanda Kochhar, the then head of ICICI Bank, for an interactive session with the visiting Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. A little over a month later, the toast of the town was battling allegations of impropriety that led to a multi-agency probe and an eventual forced leave-of-absence.The 56-year-old Kochhar, who rose to occupy the corner office at the largest private sector lender, was mired in allegations of conflicts of interest, lack of disclosures and quid pro-quo while extending loans to the now bankrupt Videocon Industries. She, in fact, was the first woman to head a large lender in the country.Kochhar, a favourite of the then group chairman KV Kamath, joined ICICI, an infrastructure lender in its earlier avatar, as a management trainee in 1984 and rose to play an important part in its transformation into a retail-focused lender and when it turned into a commercial bank in the early 1990s. 66068380 After the exit of the larger-than-life KV Kamath, she was chosen in 2009 to succeed the illustrious leader as the managing director and chief executive despite a strong leadership bench. Her elevation also led to the exit of Shikha Sharma (Axis Bank chief), who was senior to her in ranking from the group. Before her elevation to the corner office, she was a key member of the bank's setting up, oversaw the retail business and was also chief financial officer.She consolidated activities at ICICI Bank, the only domestic lender to be impacted in the post-Lehman crisis, and ensured it speaks little and it is only her who does the talking all the time.While Kamath faced many bank runs during his tenure, Kochhar's brute control on the institution has led to a complete arrest of such negative press. There was just one run-on during her tenure.When an RBI review in 2015 found high amount of under-reported dud assets with the bank, she announced a new strategy of concentrating only on the well-rated borrowers.She championed many social causes but it was her inspiring rise to the top that was most admired. Yet, she perplexed many with her contrarian views that girls lack quantitative analytical skills, blaming it on the limited number of women in B-schools.Over the years her leadership of the bank became a hyphenated relationship, wherein she came to define the bank, till it was broken Thursday with the announcement of her formal exit, six months after allegations of impropriety first cropped up against her, though she has been on an indefinite leave from May after the board was forced to appoint an external probe into the entire issue.The reasons for her ouster pertain to the loan to Videocon and the business dalliances between its promoter Venugopal Dhoot and her husband Deepak Kochhar. Dhoot had invested in and subsequently exited a power company promoted by Deepak and Chanda Kochhar did not recuse herself or disclose this when a loan was granted by ICICI Bank to Videocon as part of a consortium.Initially, she enjoyed full backing of the board but lost support as the list of allegations kept growing with more names like an Essar group shell company of the Ruias also emerging among those with whom the Kochhar family had a relationships.However, the gains from the Ruia ties were only a fraction of Videocon's loan of Rs 3,250 crore in FY11 which soon turned dud.These allegations led to probes by multiple agencies, including the CBI, ED and SFIO, and also questioning of the Kochhar family members.Finally, it was a complaint by a whistleblower who is yet to be named, which proved to be her undoing.After exonerating her initially in the face of Videocon allegations, the bank launched an independent probe by retired judge BN Srikrishna and Kochhar went on indefinite leave pending the enquiry. This led to Sandeep Bakhshi being made the chief operating officer to oversee the day-to-day operations.Kochhar had six months to go before her current term expires in March 2019. Regulations allow private sector bank chiefs to continue till the age of 70. Her offer to resign was accepted with immediate effect Thursday and Bakhshi was elevated to succeed her. The probe against her will continue and its outcome will determine the compensation she gets, the bank said in a statement.In the past few months, shareholders have sought clarity on the issue at annual meetings and also raised concerns over the bank's move to appoint her as the chairman of group's securities arm. Kochhar, who maintained a huge public profile, has been away from public glare since May, since her forced leave.From a performance perspective, when she took over ICICI Bank was the second largest in the system and the largest among its private sector peers. But at the end of her actual carrier at the bank it was reduced to a distant No 3 in the system and the second largest private sector lender after HDFC Bank by a wide margin.The bank closed fiscal 2018 with advances of Rs 5.12 trillion on a deposit of Rs 56.1 trillion and net income of a paltry Rs 1,142 crore. In FY10 (her first full year at the helm), the bank had reported a net income of Rs 4,025 crore on a much smaller balance-sheet of Rs 2.02 trillion in deposits and Rs 1.81 trillion in advances.Investors cheered the announcement, probably because of the clarity it brings in.

He said that when the loan was sanctioned, the interest rate was 9.25% with fixed EMI of Rs 38,410 payable for 120 months.He added that he had been paying EMIs regularly and was under the impression that the bank would stop collecting EMIs at the end of 120th month. However, when he checked his bank statements, he noticed that he paid a total sum of Rs 49.73 lakh in 136 months. He brought the issue to the notice of the bank and sought details.Raj Kumar submitted that he was shocked to notice that only Rs 17.93 lakh was deducted from the principal amount and outstanding payable amount was Rs 28.73 lakh. He said that rate of interest, displayed as 14.85% in loan account, was never agreed upon and claimed that bank officials never informed him about the change in interest rate.Raj Kumar claimed that he issued several notices to the bank, but his concerns were not addressed, so he filed this complaint.The bank representatives, in their written version, submitted that as the complainant agreed for floating interest rate, it is susceptible to change from time to time as mentioned in the loan agreement as well as sanction letter. They said that they had sent intimations periodically to the complainant whenever there was change in the rate of interest and there is no excess EMI collection from the complainant.During the trial, the bench noticed that although the bank claimed to have sent intimations to the complainant about change in rate of interest, they did not file any evidence to support their claim. “In the absence of documentary proof for communicating with the complainant whenever a change of interest rate occurred, it is difficult to believe the stand of the opposite parties on this aspect,” said the bench.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/icici-bank-to-pay-rs-55k-for-resetting-loan-interest-rate/articleshow/71621766.cms

The competition watchdog in an order noted that SBI's market share in MSME loan category was around 11 per cent in 2018-19 and several other national-level banks were present in West Bengal.  West Bengal-based Sainath Autolinks Pvt Ltd who is a dealer of Maruti Suzuki had filed the complaint against SBI.  Sainath had opened a supply chain finance unit (SCFU) account with the public sector lender in 2011, the order noted.  After a reconciliation and audit exercise undertaken by the bank with respect to the SCFU account for the financial year 2013-14, it was found that one credit entry had been captured twice and one debit entry had been missed and Sainath was liable to pay a sum of Rs 2.13 crore.  In this regard, the complainant said that the terms and conditions of the letter of arrangement are unfair, discriminatory and favours the bank. Besides, the automobile dealer alleged that the lender is in a dominant position in the banking sector and it has abused its position.  The complainant requested the fair trade regulator to declare the demand of Rs 2.13 crore as illegal and also asked for the reimbursement of the disputed amount along with 24 per cent interest per annum, among others.  However, the CCI noted that ""market share of OPs (opposite parties) in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) loan category in State of West Bengal for the period 2018-19 is around 11 per cent. Furthermore, banking sector in West Bengal seems to be characterized with presence of several national level banks such as State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, Punjab National Bank, ICICI Bank ...""  Thus, considering the large number of players operating in the relevant market, the State Bank of India does not seem to have the ability to operate independently of the competitive forces.

The process has started and the board has to take a call if the appointment has to be made from the existing pool of independent directors or by inviting an outsider to take up the position, sources said.  As the term of the current chairman is coming to an end so a new chairman has to be appointed, sources added.  Among various independent directors, seasoned banker and former Bank of Baroda chairman and managing director M D Mallya is set to be frontrunner to succeed Sharma.  Mallya was recently appointed to the ICICI Bank board as an independent director on May 29.  Other independent directors are Uday Chitale, Dileep Choksi, Neelam Dhawan, Radhakrishnan Nair, V K Sharma (LIC Chairman), and Lok Ranjan (government nominee director).  ICICI Bank is facing the heat in view of the allegations made against its CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar for allegedly providing loans on quid pro quo basis to benefit family members.  Last week, the board of India's largest private sector lender ICICI Bank had ordered an independent probe into allegations of 'conflict of interest' and 'quid pro quo' in Kochhar's dealing with certain borrowers.  There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis.  It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.  Last month, market regulator Sebi had served a notice on Kochhar on dealings of the bank with Videocon Group and Nupower.  The scope of enquiry would be comprehensive and include all relevant matters arising out of and in course of examination of the facts and wherever warranted, use of forensics/email reviews and recordal of statements of relevant personal, the statement had said.  The enquiry, the bank had said, will be conducted by an 'independent and credible' person.  The whistle-blower had alleged that the bank's MD and CEO had not adhered to provisions relating to code of conduct of the bank and legal and regulatory provisions relating to conflict of interest over a period of time and also alleged quid pro quo in the course of Kochhar's work in dealing with certain customers/borrowers of the bank.  Interestingly in April, the board had expressed full confidence in Kochhar and ruled out any quid pro quo as alleged with regard to certain loan given to Videocon group.  The regulator filing, which came today after close of stock market, further said the enquiry will cover all ""connected matters"" in the course of investigations to bring the matter to a final close.

ICICI,2019-09-24T04:01:00+05:30,TNN,"Sensex takes another 4-figure leap, records highest 2-day rise ever","India Business News: The sensex recorded another four-digit jump to close above the 39,000 mark after a gap of two months as investors remained ​positive after the govt's ","MUMBAI: The bulls on Dalal Street continued their march on Monday. The sensex recorded another four-digit jump to close above the 39,000 mark after a gap of two months as investors remained hugely positive on the government’s decision to give fiscal sops to corporates through lower taxes.After gaining 1,400 points during the day, the sensex closed 1,075 points higher — its fifth biggest single-session jump ever — at 39,090. In just two sessions and after touching a six-month low at last Thursday’s close, the sensex has now gained almost 3,000 points, BSE data showed. This also made investors richer by over Rs 10.6 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 148.4 lakh crore.Among all the large market indices globally, India is now the best performing over the last two days, news reports pointed out.Monday’s session also saw six of the sensex’s 30 constituents hitting a 52-week high, another clear signal of how D Street investors are treating the government’s tax decision.The broader nifty on NSE also reclaimed the 11,600 level, jumping 326 points to end just a tad above that mark.The day’s charge was led by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) with a net buying figure of Rs 2,684 crore, one of the biggest single-session figure since July. In contrast, on Friday that witnessed a record-setting rally, FPIs were net buyers of stocks worth just Rs 35 crore. Since the budget presented on July 5 proposed a net tax on foreign funds, FPIs have mostly been on a selling spree with a net outflow figure of Rs 35,000 crore, official data showed.Brokers feel under the new corporate taxation structure, foreign investors should start looking at India differently than earlier. According to Suveer Chainani, CEO-institutional clients group, Emkay Global Financial Services, the government’s big fiscal stimulus should revive growth in the economy, lift investor sentiments and also boost the capex cycle. “The negative impact of higher fiscal deficit should be mitigated as higher FDI and FPI flows start to lift India’s balance of payment and benign CPI, along with higher transmission should cap systemic rates,” he said.“More importantly, the Asian manufacturing supply chains are getting reconfigured and its great timing for India to finally attract FDI in manufacturing.”On Monday, although foreign funds were big buyers, domestic funds recorded a modest net buying figure of Rs 292 crore, BSE data showed.Banks and financial services companies again led the charge with the twins HDFC Bank and HDFC, together with ICICI Bank, contributing more than half of sensex’s gain for the day. On the other hand, Infosys, TCS and Reliance Industries closed lower and weighed on the index.The day’s rally in the stock market, however, failed to boost the domestic currency which closed just a paise stronger at 70.93 to the dollar. Analysts said the gain in rupee is muted mainly because given the chances of higher government borrowing, yields have risen sharply, putting pressure on the currency. Also global economic fears and oil price hike are weighing on the currency, they said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-takes-another-4-figure-leap-records-highest-2-day-rise-ever/articleshow/71268030.cms

The scope of enquiry will be comprehensive and we hope to conclude the uncertainties relating to the issue at the earliest,"" Chaturvedi said.""It will be my topmost priority to uphold the best governance practices at this esteemed institution,"" he added.The bank had appointed the former bureaucrat as its new non-executive part-time Chairman in late June.Chaturvedi, 65, replaced former Chairman MK Sharma whose term ended on June 30, 2018.The country's largest private sector lender registered its first ever loss in more than a decade at Rs 120 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal due to higher provisioning for bad loans.It had posted a net profit of Rs 2,049 crore in the April-June period of last fiscal.In 2017-18, the bank had posted a net profit of Rs 6,777 crore. However, its gross bad loans by end-March 2018 remained at an elevated level of 8.84 of gross advances by that period, translating into Rs 54,063 crore.""ICICI Bank has seen its share of challenges in the recent past due to the elevated level of non-performing assets (NPAs) but has been dealing with them in the best interest of all stakeholders,"" Chaturvedi said.He said the bank has continued to focus on improving its portfolio mix, resolving stressed assets and enhancing its customer franchise.Lauding the Reserve Bank's initiative of mandating referral of large NPAs for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the Chairman said these are welcome steps aimed at accelerating resolution of existing stressed loans as well as enhancing credit discipline and proactive resolution on a sustained basis going forward.Separately, in her message to shareholders, Kochhar said in the report that the retail segment would remain the key driver of growth, with segments like business banking, credit cards and personal loans growing at a higher pace off a lower base, while home loans would continue to be the largest part of the portfolio.""In the past four years, the bank has made significant progress in de-risking the balance sheet and continued to enhance the franchise,"" she added.ICICI Bank's tier-I capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.92 per cent and the total capital adequacy at 18.42 per cent by end-March 2018, both well above the regulatory requirements.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-chairman-assures-of-top-priority-to-governance-practices/articleshow/65243220.cms

The reason for this was that a large number of banks pay up to 36% tax under the current structure, which could come down by about 10 percentage points as most lenders are operated under a holding company structure and their consolidated accounts have their subsidiaries’ accounts which pay higher taxes, analysts said. According to Deven Choksey of K R Choksey Securities, “ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, among the larger banks, would benefit the most. Most of the banks are in the higher tax bracket and hence will see improvement in earnings.”Private banks lead the pack of gainers. “The winners are clearly private banks. HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank and IndusInd Bank will be key beneficiaries as their tax rate have been as high as 34% in the past. So, the benefit to their earnings would be 13-14% and return on assets (RoA) could improve by 20-25bps,” said Mona Khetan, banking analyst at Reliance Securities. “For the sector as whole, we expect earnings to improve by 10% on account of the decline in tax rates,” Khetan said.In the mid-sized space, Central Bank of India stands to gain the most, analysts said. However, some analysts are skeptical if the tax cuts alone could bring in foreign investors to India since global worries still persist. “Sticking with markets, we think the rally in local equities will be short-lived. Stocks have surged since the measures were announced, with the sensex now over 38,000,” said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics. “We continue to expect a pullback over the coming months, as a slowdown in the US causes the S&P 500 to drop and investors to retreat from risky assets generally.” ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/among-banks-pvt-lenders-to-gain-most/articleshow/71227236.cms

It was the HDFC “twins” — HDFC and HDFC Bank — that led the sensex’s slide, BSE data","MUMBAI: Concern about rising crude oil prices after attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend, weak economic data from China, continued selling by foreign funds and a weakening rupee combined to pull the sensex down 642 points, or 1.8%, on Tuesday to close at 36,481. It was the HDFC “twins” — HDFC and HDFC Bank — that led the sensex’s slide, BSE data showed.The day’s trading started on a flat note but the index lost ground through the session with the intra-day low at 36,419, down almost 700 points from the previous close.

Other notable drags on the index were ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Reliance Industries.According to Shrikant S Chouhan, senior VP (equity technical research), Kotak Securities, after the rupee plunged to 71.95 to a dollar, Brent crude prices moved to $69 per barrel and the yield on 10-year government bonds was at 6.72%. “All these factors are dampening the economy and will be difficult to tackle in the short term,” Chouhan said.However, late in the evening, as reports emerged that Saudi Arabia was confident of restoring its oil facilities to pre-attack level in 3-5 weeks, crude prices softened. This could also positively impact Dalal Street’s sentiment on Wednesday, dealers said.Banking and auto stocks were among the top sold stocks. According to market players, a spike in crude oil prices is most likely to push up petrol and diesel prices, which in turn would lead to a rise in inflation. Rising prices often force the RBI to hike interest rates.

Banks like ICICI Bank and Paytm Payments Bank got an 'average' rating for their performance while a host of other entities were rated 'unsatisfactory'. This overall rating is based on multiple factors such as percentage of target digital transactions achieved, merchant deployment, active merchant base in urban areas, and the failure rate of transactions on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) among others. 53 entities have been reviewed by Meity, a copy of which has been seen by TOI. Meity did not disclose absolute numbers on these metrics. In comparison, during the final quarter of last financial year 15 entities were ranked ‘good’ in their overall performance on digital payments. As reported by TOI in May, Meity handed out large volume of targets to State Bank of India, Paytm, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank among others. These entities are the heavy lifters of government’s ambition to reach the annual digital transaction target. The quarterly performance would be key to eventually how much of digital payments expansion is achieved at the end of March 2020.  According to the Meity report card, Fino and HDFC Bank's overall score was 72 and 67 respectively. ICICI Bank was at rank 10 (score 57) while Paytm Payments Bank was at 26 (score 52). While both Fino and HDFC Bank clocked more than the target digital transactions for the period of April to June this year, other players in the top 10 ranks had managed to clock over 90% of target digital transactions. Even for the banks who topped the chart, HDFC Bank saw technical declines---where a transaction could not be completed due to technical issues, of over 1% on UPI while the same for Fino was 0.42%.  A spokesperson of Paytm Payments Bank said there appears to be some communication gap for which they are co-ordinating with Meity for necessary rectification. “Industry will see that PPB will be in line in with its earlier ranking in list published in future,” the spokesperson said without disclosing details of the talks with Meity. It added the bank had overachieved the metric of digital transactions but did not comment on other metrics that are part of Meity report.  “By the end of this fiscal, we plan to increase our merchant network to 2.5 lakh points driven largely by our focus on east and north eastern geographies. We already have 60,000 micro ATMs in the market with plans to reach 1,00,000 by end of March 2020,” said Ashish Ahuja, CBO, Fino Payments Bank.

Investors, who cheered last Friday’s government announcements, including the rollback of a controversial surcharge on taxes paid by foreign investors, ended up Rs 2.4 lakh crore richer .In the forex market, the rupee breached the 72-mark to the dollar after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said a weak rupee would help India’s exports.The day’s session on D Street started with the sensex up over 650 points, dipping into the negative zone and then rallying over 1,000 points from the day’s low.

On the NSE, the nifty closed 229 points, or 2.1% higher, at 11,058. 70854108 The day’s gains came despite a Rs 753 crore net selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Since July, FPIs have net sold stocks worth about Rs 24,500 crore, official data showed.Global markets, including India, got a boost in mid-session after US President Donald Trump welcomed China’s desire for a trade deal and said the two countries would start negotiating soon, dealers said.Banks and NBFCs, expected to be the biggest beneficiaries from the announcement relating to recapitalization of government-run banks and reversal of surcharge on FPIs, gained the most. However, the rally was narrow as BSE data showed that about 61% of the day’s sensex gain came from just three stocks: HDFC Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank, in which FPI holding is high. 70854122 According to Arun Thukral, MD & CEO, Axis Securities, stakeholders in the economy reacted positively to FM’s announcements while the financial market in particular was positive after the much-awaited withdrawal of FPI surcharge. “The measures taken to improve liquidity and push the ailing auto sector are likely to augur well for the economy. Focus on infrastructure and MSMEs has shown the government’s intent to provide stimulus as needed and has certainly brought optimism in the market,” Thukral said.A report by BNP Paribas Securities noted that the announcements are working as a confidence booster, have minimal fiscal impact but there’s a lot to be done yet. Analysts at the foreign brokerage feel that earnings revival still remains a long term concern for the market while on the global front the US-China trade war could weigh on market sentiment.Chartists feel that the move upwards from the current level may not be smooth for the benchmark indices. In a note, Shrikant Chouhan, head of technical research, Kotak Securities, said that technically, the nifty is still below 11,185—the previous highest level—and once this level is breached, buying would emerge. “A number of resistances are lined up between 11,070 and 11185”, he said, and “hence one cannot expect a smooth ride from the current level.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-zooms-793-points-biggest-one-day-gain-since-ls-results/articleshow/70850274.cms

As a result, investigators haven’t been able to fully equip themselves to handle and mitigate such cases.According to Maharashtra Police special IGP (cyber) Brijesh Singh, cyber criminals are gradually targeting banks’ infrastructure rather than customers, and the incidents occur regularly. “In the West, there is a lot of interaction between banks and law enforcement agencies. However, here there is no reporting of incidents….there should also be a common threat-sharing platform, so that banks can learn from each other,” Singh said at the Ficci-IBA summit here. He added that, while new technology is being adopted by banks at a rapid pace, security is often an afterthought. “It is morally wrong to blame customers for their stupidity. There is a need to be secure by design,” he said, adding that banks could partner with the police to train youngsters to monitor risks and handle threats. Bankers said that typically such incidents are shared within the industry. However, they are through informal channels. ICICI Bank chief information security officer Ganesh A R said, “Being regulated entities, it (sharing) is not easy…there are obligations to customers, the regulator. There is a need to look at its consequences.”Meanwhile, SBI deputy MD and chief information officer Dhananjaya Tambe stressed on lack of skilled talent in cybersecurity. “We have invested in world-class technology, but we need people to make use of it,” he said. He stressed that people and processes were as important as technology in fighting cybercrime.“Access control and management and segregation of duties…there should be more awareness about this. Even if the perimeter is secured, the threat can originate internally. The insider threat will be more dangerous in the future,” Tambe said, referring to naive employees and contractors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-do-not-report-most-cybercrimes-says-top-cop/articleshow/70761912.cms

The scam has led to a slew of changes, including a ban on the letters of undertaking (LoU), which can hurt importers.""International trade is the backbone of globalisation and an imperative for India to grow,"" Swift's head for Indian subcontinent, Kiran Shetty, said in a statement.The statement said the newly launched service will help all the corporates in the country.The service enables real-time payments tracking across correspondent banks and has a facility to track the payments instructions across the correspondent banks globally, it said.The cooperative is also looking to add features to it, including an ability to stop and recall payment in case of a fraud or when a duplicate payment has been sent erroneously.Shetty said the powerful economies look for a trusted trading partner, and claimed the new service 'Swift gpi' will help in ease of doing business.He added ""hundreds of thousands"" of gpi (global payments innovation) payments are already being sent daily and being settled in minutes, and even seconds.ICICI Bank's executive director Vijay Chandok said it is committed to improve transparency and the new service helps it deliver a totally new standard.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-first-to-get-swifts-new-cross-border-payment-service/articleshow/63642657.cms

Bureau officials said the LOC was issued against an FIR lodged by the CBI in 2017 for allegedly causing a loss of Rs 48 crore to ICICI Bank. The couple was flying to Nairobi by an Air Kenya flight, sources at the airport said, adding there were a few others accompanying them.Soon after they were stopped by immigration, NDTV released a statement titled “Complete subversion of media freedom in action against NDTV founders”.The statement read: “In a complete subversion of basic rights, Radhika and Prannoy Roy were prevented from leaving the country... Both had tickets to return to India on the 15th, just a week later. They have been stopped from travelling abroad on the basis of a fake and wholly unsubstantiated corruption case initiated by the CBI that was filed two years ago and in which Radhika and Prannoy Roy have been fully cooperating. Today’s action is, along with events like raids on media owners, a warning to the media to fall in line — or else.”CBI had filed the FIR on June 2, 2017 and subsequently carried out searches at the residence of the couple. The FIR pertains to a complaint filed by one Sanjay Dutt — a shareholder of ICICI Bank and also director of a Delhi-based firm, Quantum Securities — alleging a loss of Rs 48 crore to ICICI Bank.In the FIR, some executives of the bank were also accused of “conniving, committing fraud and entering into a conspiracy” with NDTV promoters in facilitating transfer of ownership of a news broadcasting company to a “shell company” in violation of various laws.

The amount was transferred,"MUMBAI: A senior citizen is struggling to recover Rs 25 lakh debited fraudulently from his bank account using a duplicate SIM card. The amount was transferred into four accounts across the country. While the police are investigating the money trail, the multi-state nature of the crime is making recovery difficult.When Mahavir Mittal, a retired government employee in Noida, was unable to access his IndusInd Bank account through netbanking and found his Airtel mobile connection blocked, he approached the bank. On June 14, the bank informed Mittal that Rs 25.1 lakh was transferred from his account. The fraudulent transactions took place on June 12. The amount was transferred to three different accounts — Rs 5 lakh to a Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Akbarpur branch in UP, Rs 6.3 lakh to a Bank of Baroda a/c in Allahabad and Rs 13.8 lakh to an ICICI Bank holder in Nadia, West Bengal. Mittal lodged a complaint with the Noida Cyber Crime Cell on June 14.  70284466 By obtaining a duplicate SIM, the fraudster managed to get the OTP sent to Mittal, whose SIM was inactive since June 8. On June 11, Mittal visited an Airtel store to complain about his inactive SIM, where he was informed that the SIM was actually active on a different phone.The RBI entitles customers for zero liability where the deficiency lies neither with the bank nor with the customer but elsewhere in the system. The customer has to notify the bank within three working days of receiving communication regarding the unauthorised transaction. 70527695 An IndusInd Bank spokesperson said, “It is practically impossible to fraudulently withdraw money from an online account unless the customer compromises personal details inadvertently or otherwise.” The spokesperson said that adding a beneficiary for funds transfer requires two factor authentication — the login ID & password and an OTP sent to the customer’s registered mobile number. “In this case, the bank sent the OTP to the registered mobile number of the customer,” he said. He added that the bank is cooperating with the investigation.In response to the duplicate SIM issue, an Airtel spokesperson said the company is assisting the police in their investigation. The spokesperson added that customers are advised not to share any sensitive or personal information with anyone. 68143217 According to Kotak group chief communication officer Rohit Rao, the bank acted promptly upon receiving an intimation from IndusInd Bank on June 14, requesting return of funds debited to Mittal’s account on June 12 and credited to the account of Larenj Kumar, an account holder of Kotak’s Akbarpur branch.“However, even before IndusInd Bank requested for reversal of credit, funds had already been withdrawn from Kumar’s account, which was opened after conducting full KYC authentication and physical address verification under the prescribed regulations. We have learnt that Mittal has filed a police complaint and we are extending full cooperation to the police in their investigation,” said Rao.A Bank of Baroda official confirmed that the account, which has received the funds, has been frozen and said that they have not filed an FIR. The bank did not share any details on the KYC status or whether there was any money in the frozen account. “We had put a lien on the said beneficiary account, as soon as it was brought to our notice by the originating bank. We are cooperating with the police in this matter,” said an ICICI Bank spokesperson.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/senior-citizen-loses-rs-25-lakh-to-sim-swap-fraud/articleshow/70527696.cms

Kochhar's departure follows the investigation on suspected nepotism and quid pro quo in loans given to the Videocon group (which had ties to her husband).But Kochhar isn't the only top banker to be booted out unceremoniously:Big Brother's directive: Earlier this year, the RBI made known its displeasure in the continuation of Shikha Sharma as Axis Bank CEO for the fourth-consecutive three-year term, citing the bank's deteriorating asset quality — Sharma announced her decision to quit by December 2018. 63688047 Costly bad loans: In the case of Rana Kapoor, founder and CMD of Yes Bank, the RBI intervened to cut short his three-year-term as the top honcho, asking him to take a permanent hike by January 31, 2019, despite pleadings by the bank's board to allow him to continue till April 2019 — apparently, Kapoor got the boot for under-reporting of NPAs by Rs 10,000 crore as per an RBI audit. 65878926 Day to remember: On the day her term was to end in superannuation, Allahabad Bank MD & CEO Usha Ananthasubramanian was sacked by the government for her complicity in the Rs 14,000 crore fraud masterminded by absconding jeweller Nirav Modi, during her tenure as the MD of PNB between August 2015-May 2017 — she had been divested of all her powers a few months prior to her dismissal and placed on leave. Additionally, the CBI has also been asked to prosecute her. 65394238 Bone with bonus: The RBI had also put on hold its approval for the bonuses for the top three private sector bankers — Chanda Kochhar's Rs 2.2 crore bonus, Shikha Sharma's Rs 1.35 crore bonus and MD and CEO of HDFC Bank, Aditya Puri's bonus of Rs 2.9 crore, which were due to them for the year 2016-17 — for over a year for divergence between the actual and reported bad loans.Kochhar's departure was cheered by the investors, with ICICI Bank's stock rising 4% even as the Nifty Bank index fell over 297 points on Thursday.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-being-a-bank-ceo-is-an-unbankable-job/articleshow/66084440.cms

Kochhar’s term, her third, was due to end in March 2019.While the board accepted her resignation, it did not clear her of impropriety. “The enquiry instituted by the board will remain unaffected by this and certain benefits will be subject to the outcome of the enquiry,” the bank said—six months after the board had, many say rashly, “reposed full faith and confidence” in her and stated there was “no question of any quid pro quo/nepotism/conflict of interest” in her decisions.At the centre of the storm is her husband Deepak Kochhar and his brother Rajiv, and their financial dealings with a number of business groups that received loans from ICICI Bank. Besides, Srikrishna, the CBI, Enforcement Directorate and Sebi have also been looking into allegations of misconduct and corruption.Kochhar’s exit, which signalled an end to months of uncertainty, sent the bank’s stock up 4% amid an otherwise plummeting market. “We believe the appointment of a new CEO with a fairly long tenure will provide much needed clarity, direction and continuity to the bank,” said Lalitabh Shrivastawa of Sharekhan.Ever since she was forced to step aside, there’d been widespread speculation as to whether she would wait for the investigation to end and attempt a comeback even if for just a few months. While there was no clear answer on Thursday as to why she chose to finally throw in the towel now, there’s been a growing sense that the enquiry report might not give her the clean chit she would have hoped for. Also, there’s been talk—which this paper has not been able to independently confirm—of Srikrishna broadening the scope of his enquiry to scrutinize a range of lending decisions. To top it all, the last few months have not been easy for top bankers with the RBI denying Shikha Sharma another term at Axis Bank and trimming Rana Kapoor’s tenure at Yes Bank.Kochhar's resignation relieves her of the code of conduct rules of the bank. Since there was not much of a future left for her at the bank, the exit frees her to pursue other interests. Kochhar was appointed CEO in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. During her tenure in the bank she was seen to have taken several initiatives to improve workplace conditions for women.Bakhshi, who was earlier MD and CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, was inducted in June as COO of the bank for a period of five years—which placed him in pole position to succeed Kochhar, sooner or later.In a separate move, MD Mallya, who had been nominated director earlier this year, resigned from the board on health grounds.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/icici-bank-ceo-kochhar-resigns-before-probe-ends/articleshow/66078207.cms

Shocked users took to Twitter to complain that they received a message from ICICI Bank stating: ""Your registration for UPI app has started…,"" when they had made no such request.For those with existing Unified Payments Interface (UPI) IDs, the app triggered an SMS to link their UPI account to Truecaller Pay. ICICI Bank is Truecaller's partner for its payments services. While the action amounted to bypassing steps needed to create a UPI account, it did not complete the set-up process, or impact users' finances.Twitter user Aashish Bansal (@Unbelted) told TOI this happened to him on a spare phone, which did not have any third-party apps except for Truecaller. ""I log on to Truecaller and find that a UPI ID has been created for my account mapped to this phone number. I quickly reset Truecaller to unlink the UPI from this app and uninstalled the app,"" he said.The issue has come to the notice of the National Payments Corporation of India - the Reserve Bank of India-promoted body which has created the UPI platform enabling bank customers to access their accounts through third-party apps.According to NPCI, while the app has erred in enrolling customers without consent, it does not mean they are all set to conduct UPI transactions. ""With this (enrolment) alone customer cannot undertake a transaction.

NPCI further said that it will take action against Truecaller if it is found to be non-compliant. “There was an issue in the App observed today. We have been updated that last night’s migration had resulted in a bug in the workflow. We understand that it has being fixed and till then user on-boarding has been stopped in this app. NPCI ensures to take action if found non. Compliant,” said Dilip Asbe, MD & CEO of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). For those unaware, Truecaller had pushed out an update for its app with some bugs that allowed the app to send an encrypted message to ICICI Bank to automatically start the user registration for ICICI Bank UPI services. After the update, the app did not ask for any consent before proceeding with the UPI registration. ""This is enrolling mistake by the app without customer consent. With this customer can't do any UPI transaction . For on-boarding to UPI the customer has to still enter 2FA (issuer OTP and debit card), and set UPI pin. The workflow mistake is limited to enrolling which will not have any impact on any customer account whatsoever,"" added Asbe. Truecaller users across India took to social media to complain about the issue as they feared that they might lose money from their ICICI Bank accounts via UPI account transfers. Truecaller has accepted the glitch and have taken down this version of the app. If you have been affected by this bug, then you will have to manually unregister your UPI account from the Truecaller app and then choose to uninstall it and download the app again if you wish.Official statement by Truecaller: “We have discovered a bug in the latest update of Truecaller that affected the payments feature, which automatically triggered a registration post updating to the version. This was a bug and we have discontinued this version of the app so no other users will be affected. We're sorry about this version not passing our quality standards. We've taken quick steps to fix the issue, and already rolled out a fix in a new version. For the users already affected, the new version with the fix will be available shortly, however, in the meanwhile they can choose to manually deregister through the overflow menu in the app.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/heres-what-npci-has-to-say-about-the-truecaller-bug/articleshow/70452659.cms

The order was issued by the Maharastra government’s adjudicating officer (information technology). The complaint filed was in June 2015 by a Nashik-based company, Daffodils Furnishing, against Idea Cellular, RBL Bank and ICICI Bank. The principal secretary in the state government plays the role of adjudicating officer.The case is yet another instance where a bank’s dependence on the registered mobile number for authentication has resulted in a fraud. While the company has argued that issuance of a duplicate SIM is a telecom dispute, the adjudicating authority has held it liable, stating that “a SIM card is an absolute key to a customer’s sensitive and personal information” and that the number can be used to access bank details.According to the victim’s lawyer, Prashant Mali, who specialises in cyber law, telecom companies should be sensitive about phone numbers being linked to bank accounts. “Telecom companies should make their KYC process strong and if possible, should move to E-KYC,” S V R Srinivas, the adjudicating officer, said in the order. According to the complaint filed by Daffodils Furnishing, Rs 3.3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh were illegally debited from their account in two transactions and the money was transferred to a beneficiary in ICICI Bank. The order, however, notes that it is not established how the fraudsters managed to access the victim’s netbanking. While the banks have said that the complainant might have shared his password or responded to a phishing email, this has not been established. The order also suggested that banks add another layer of security in their communication to customers. Vodafone Idea was held liable because it was established that the application for a duplicate SIM was fraudulent. The name, photograph, date of birth and signature submitted by the fraudster did not match with that of the original. “... the employees of the respondent (Vodafone Idea) made no effort to detect forgery.”According to security experts, linking mobile numbers to Aadhaar had reduced cases of SIM-swap fraud.In August 2018, Vodafone India merged with Idea Cellular and was renamed Vodafone Idea.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/voda-idea-asked-to-pay-rs-8-5l-in-sim-swap-fraud/articleshow/70322150.cms

ICICI,2019-07-16T06:14:00+05:30,Rachel Chitra,"Banks use AI everywhere, from chatbots to validating cheques","India Business News: When someone tries to forge a signature on a bank cheque, there are minute fissures, blots or anomalies that may not be visible to the human eye, but ","NEW DELHI: In Axis Bank, cheque authentication today is largely done not by a human teller, but by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. It has multiple advantages.When someone tries to forge a signature, there are minute fissures, blots or anomalies that may not be visible to the human eye, but will become glaringly obvious to a trained bot (software robot). And if the account holder signs in a hurry and it’s not quite the same as in the bank’s system, the bot understands it’s actually a genuine signature.Only in instances where old age or disability has altered a person’s signature significantly does the bot pass on the query to a human. “But this is becoming rare, as our AI gets better with handling cheques and learns more,” says Ratan Kesh, executive VP and head of process transformation and customer experience at Axis Bank.“And because we handle millions of cheques every day, if we relied only on human tellers, it would result in fatigue, more mistakes and higher chances of fraud,” he says. 70240575 Globally, banks are the biggest buyers of technology and among the fastest adopters of new tech. Indian banks are no exception. For them, AI is both about scale (for a large number of retail customers needing a common solution) and about customisation (for corporate customers having specific requirements).AI is being employed across divisions — in reconciliation (ATM reconciliation where balances are settled between different banks and their ATM networks when one bank customer uses another bank’s ATM), in treasury (to predict the possible direction of India’s bond market based on historical data), in fund management (for more data driven, parameters-set trading for wealth management clients), in fraud management (to prevent identity theft, money laundering using deposits or loan fraud) and in regulatory compliance (to assist bank employees, who may not know the entire labyrinth of rules and regulations the RBI has for banks).One of the biggest use cases for Indian banks is the deployment of chatbots. ICICI Bank’s AI-powered virtual personal assistant iPal, launched in 2017, today addresses over 1.5 million queries a month. The bot not just answers questions, but can also pay bills, do fund transfers or recharge your mobile on your behalf. The bot can also handle complex queries on GST, government digital initiatives, service requests, ATM locations, branch details and IFSC codes.Say you have exhausted your credit card limit or missed a payment and want to know your options, the bot will provide them. Today, it’s accurate 90% of the time. “Where our bots sometimes fail is in detecting human emotions like sarcasm, anger or humour. And usually we have human assistants to take over if the bot cannot handle a query,” says Madhivanan Balakrishnan, chief digital officer at ICICI Bank. A big part of AI in chatbots is natural language processing (NLP). When bots have insufficient information on a query such as “I want to recharge my <mobile number>”, then the bot knows it needs to get details such as recharge amount, bank account number, etc.Bots are also handled to adjust for human error. Like for a person wanting to ‘recharge’, the bot will even accept text variations like ‘recharg’, ‘rchrg’, ‘re-charge’, ‘refill’, ‘add balance’, ‘load mobile’, and ‘topup’. HDFC Bank’s e-virtual assistant Eva has been programmed to work with multiple channels such as the bank’s website, app, Google Assistant and Alexa.Eva – which like so many other chatbots follows the industry norm in being female – can handle 7,500 FAQs and has till date had more than 16 million conversations. She has been integrated with online travel aggregators and service providers, so she can book bus tickets or chart out trips for you.Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Keya can talk in both English and Hindi. The bank’s senior executive VP Puneet Kapoor says Keya can recognise customer intent in 75% of cases and can independently conclude over 11% of all calls serviced by the voicebot without any human intervention — a 5x increase over the earlier self-service rate. “This amounts to over 1.7 million customer calls per month that Keya executes on her own,” he says.Talent huntLarge-sized Indian banks today have IT teams of more than a hundred each, while mid-sized ones have 20-40 each. They look for talent that knows programming languages, mathematical concepts, networking, have an aptitude and interest in banking and finance. “We build many of our automation solutions inhouse,” says Madhivanan Balakrishnan, chief digital officer at ICICI Bank.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-use-ai-everywhere-from-chatbots-to-validating-cheques/articleshow/70237317.cms

She announced a fourth quarter net profit of Rs 1,020 crore — 50 per cent lower than last year and the lowest in two years — but in line with market expectations.Her ‘2020’ strategy for the bank surprised many as her term expires in March 2019 and she continues to be dogged by a controversy over loans to defaulting borrower Videocon, which had a business relationship with her husband.Though she ducked questions about Videocon, her elaborate plans appear to be designed to quell speculation about her tenure. The meeting was skipped by government nominee Lok Rajan and V K Sharma, chairman of LIC, the bank’s largest shareholder.ICICI sees Rs 15,700 crore more loans in NPAsThe financial results meeting will be followed by another board discussion on Tuesday to discuss strategy. Kochhar said this is an annual event to discuss budget, planning and strategy for the year ahead.The results were announced post market hours. The ICICI Bank ADR was up 3.72 per cent in the New York Stock Exchange following the results at around 9pm Indian time. The profits were better than what was forecast by a Reuters poll in terms of which the bank was seen to be posting a net profit of Rs 955.7 crore. It was however marginally lower than a Bloomberg brokers’ consensus estimate of Rs 1,061crore.The bank managed to report a profit despite an additional Rs 15,737 crore loans slipping into the non-performing category. However, the sale of part of its stake in ICICI Securities helped to shore up earnings. The new NPAs include Rs 10,000 crore worth of loans that were restructured earlier but are now required to be reclassified following new norms by RBI in February.Kochhar took a defiant stance on the conflict of interest issue and refused to comment despite repeated requests, saying the board had already clarified the matter. She sought to highlight the fact that the bank was unaffected by the controversy by pointing out that the bank had added Rs 29,200 crore of current and savings account deposits and that fee income was the highest in four years.Under the new strategy, she said, the bank would bring down its corporate loans to 40 per cent of total loans and reduce exposure to large corporates. She said that the bank would bring down its non-performing assets to 1.5 per cent and the provision coverage for bad loans to 79 per cent.In a reference to the Nirav Modi case, the bank said that it has made provisions of Rs 795 crore in respect of fraud by three borrower accounts in the gems and jewellery segment. Of this, Rs 290 crore was made from income while another Rs 505 crore was done by debiting reserves and surplus. Debiting reserves prevents provisions from impacting profits but reduces the bank’s capital adequacy.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-q4-net-profit-at-2-year-low-on-fresh-npa-worth-rs-15700-crore/articleshow/64074381.cms

The bank's net profit came at Rs 1,141.93 crore, down from Rs 2,082.75 crore in the same quarter last year.Despite the loss, the bank's performance came above Street's expectations as a Reuters poll of economists had predicted the Q4 profit at Rs 955.7 crore, thus signalling a 52.7 per cent loss.The bank however, saw a gain of 18 per cent as far as total income is concerned with stood at Rs 33,760.07 crore. The bank in its financial statement for the fourth quarter mentioned no decision on the conflict-of-interest accusations against chief executive Chanda Kochhar stemming from loans given to the defaulting Videocon. The issue of compromise of corporate governance came to the fore when investor and whistleblower Arvind Gupta racked up the issue in the March.He alleged quid pro quo between Videocon Group and ICICI Bank's chief executive officer (CEO) as well as her family members with respect to extending a loan worth Rs 3,250 crore. It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.There are also allegations that NuPower got investments of Rs 325 crore from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia.The total assets of ICICI Bank came at Rs 1,124,281.04 crore at the end of the financial year 2017-18.The private lender's income from operations in the fourth quarter stood at Rs 33,760 crore, up 18 per cent, compared from Rs 28,603 crore in the same period last year.The ICICI Bank stock had a good trading session on Monday as the scrip rose 2.30 per cent on BSE. The broader market closed with a near 1 per cent gain.Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans was 8.84 per cent at the end of March, compared with 7.82 per cent at the end of the previous quarter and 7.89 per cent a year earlier.The board of the bank recommended a dividend of Rs 1.50 per equity share of face value of Rs 2 each, subject to requisite approvals.

ICICI,2019-07-11T04:00:00+05:30,TNN,PSU banks lose ground in corporate banking,"India Business News: Nationalised banks are losing market share to private banks. Not just in deposits and credit, they are also rapidly losing their position as lead bank","MUMBAI: Nationalised banks are losing market share to private banks. Not just in deposits and credit, they are also rapidly losing their position as lead bank — the lender which calls the shots in lending to businesses — in many corporate relationships. While most corporates have multiple banking relationships, they can have only one bank that sets the terms and conditions for credit facilities.According to a report by Greenwich associates, HDFC Bank and SBI top the list as lead bankers for corporates. Each of these two banks is used for corporate banking services by roughly three-quarters (75%) of large Indian companies. Close behind is ICICI Bank, with a market penetration score of 71%. These three banks also secure the top spots among middle-market banking companies, with HDFC Bank in first place and ICICI and SBI tied in the No. 2 spot.70165774 The report said that weak balance sheets and other immediate challenges like bad loans are preventing PSU banks from making long-term IT investments, which are needed to compete for wholesale banking business in the future. This comes at a time when the needs of businesses are getting more complex and they are looking for value-added services. The loss of lead bank status has implications for retail businesses too as many private banks offer attractive ‘salary account’ schemes for corporates where they are lead banks.Among foreign banks, Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank are tied with a market penetration of 51–54% among large Indian corporates, followed by HSBC at 50%. In the middle-market space, among foreign banks, HSBC ranks first, StanChart second and Citi a close third.The nationalised banks (PSBs excluding SBI) have been losing marketshare because almost half of them were placed under prompt corrective action (PCA) by the RBI last year. The PCA framework disallows banks from taking on fresh lending risks until they have cleaned up their balance sheet.According to the Greenwich report, as of 2016, 20% of large Indian corporates participating in the annual corporate banking study said they used at least one PSU bank as a lead corporate bank. In 2018, that share had fallen to just 15% with private banks grabbing market share.Ironically, even where nationalised banks are the top credit provider they are not cited as a leading provider in non-credit products such as foreign exchange and cash management — roles that are being filled most often by private banks. “The one outlier to this trend is SBI, which has moved faster and made more progress than other PSU banks to address the NPA issue. It actually increased its share of lead corporate banking relationships to 6% of large companies in 2018 from 4% in 2016,” the report said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/psbs-lose-ground-in-corporate-banking/articleshow/70165775.cms

The rupee gained 8 paise to close at 68.42, while the 10-year government bond saw its yield fall sharply to an intra-day low of 6.58% from 6.75% before closing at 6.69%.Globally, difficulty in servicing external sovereign debt has landed many economies in a soup. However, the Indian government seems to have well-timed its announcement, given that central banks, globally, are cutting rates and the rupee has been stable.Selling bonds overseas is seen to boost the supply of dollars and reduce the flow of government bonds which led to the rally in these markets despite equities closing lower. According to bankers, the timing is right for a sovereign bond as there is no pressure on the fisc and the currency is stable. 70099545 “Raising sovereign debt from international markets removes the crowding out effect for corporate and non-government borrowers. Investors have already voted positively, bond yields have already moved southward by 10 to 12 basis points, which in turn signals further softening of interest rates in India,” said Shanti Ekambaram, president (consumer banking), Kotak Mahindra Bank.India has a credit rating of Baa2 from Moody’s and BBB- from Standard & Poors. India’s rating is in line with that of other emerging markets like Indonesia and Philippines, but higher than that of Russia. According to investment bankers, issuers with a rating of Baa2 have been able to raise 5-year funds at a rate of 3.25%. While this is much higher than what governments in developed countries pay, it will help diversify source of funds. It will also help set benchmarks in terms of a credit-default spread for Indian issuance and help develop the bond market. “For the current year, while nothing additional has been budgeted for the overseas borrowing account, opening up of this route should benefit the bond market in the long term. The fact that the government will now be seeking external funds for sovereign needs reflects a fundamental shift in the budgeting process and in the budgeting philosophy in our view,” said Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank.Speaking to Bloomberg, B Prasanna, group head for global markets at ICICI Bank, said that the decision to issue a sovereign bond overseas reflects the Modi government’s confidence in the economy.

During its preliminary enquiry, the CBI found that six loans worth Rs 1,875 crore were sanctioned to the Videocon Group and companies associated with it between June 2009 and October 2011 in alleged violation of laid-down policies of ICICI Bank, which have now become part of the probe.The loans were declared non-performing assets in 2012, causing a loss of Rs 1,730 crore to the bank, it alleged.The ED, sources said, is also probing at least two other instances of loans given by the ICICI Bank (during Chanda Kochhar's tenure) to Gujarat-based pharmaceutical firm Sterling Biotech and to Bhushan Steel group, both of which are under its probe for alleged money laundering charges.

They want products and services to help them manage their money more effectively. Financial products and services that are more streamlined and intuitive are among their favourite. And so, for banks, targeting millennials should begin with designing a quality user experience.  Taking cue, ICICI Bank has announced the launch of India’s first comprehensive banking programme for millennial customers, in the age bracket of 18 years to 35 years. Inspired by ‘Millennial Network’, the proposition is called ‘ICICI Bank Mine.' It offers an instant savings account, new-look mobile application with a refreshed user interface that offers two additional benefits in addition to the already existing bouquet of features- personal finance management tool and investment guidance to suit the demand of millennials with the help of Sqrrl, an investment fintech.

In fact, the first experiential branch for millennials is already open at Manyata Tech Park in Bengaluru.  Commenting on the launch, Mr. Anup Bagchi, Executive Director, ICICI Bank said, “Our country is uniquely poised for a demographic dividend in the coming years with millions of youth expected to join the workforce. We estimate that the country has around 40 million progressive young millennials, who would contribute significantly to the economy and banking in the years to come. Our extensive research shows that millennial customers want banking to be simple, digitally enabled and customised. Based on these insights, we have created ‘ICICI Bank Mine’, the country’s first full banking stack for millennials. It offers a mobile first, highly personalised and experiential led banking experience to them. We have noticed that, while the millennial customers want ‘digital first’, they don’t want a ‘digital only’ bank. This has led us to introduce a new format experiential branch suited to the lifestyle of millennials. Designing mobile banking applications isn’t as simple providing users with a way of checking the balance of their accounts. Millennials increasingly access and manage their financial assets exclusively through these applications; when they want to do something with their money, they expect to be able to do it quickly and smoothly through a single channel. “‘ICICI Bank Mine’ also offers investment guidance to customers through a completely new-look mobile application. For this, we have integrated the investment platform of Sqrrl, a leading fintech in the investment space, with our mobile application iMobile, to guide customers to invest easily and in a tech-savvy way. We intend to continue to integrate relevant fintech offerings in the iMobile app for our millennial customers. We believe that ‘ICICI Bank Mine’ offers millennial customers a 360-degree holistic and most comprehensive proposition in a single place across their life stages,” he added.Here is what millennials can expect from their ICICI Bank Mine stack: 79304123Instant savings account opening: One can easily open a savings account - digitally and instantly - on the Bank’s website or mobile application using their Aadhaar and PAN card. The account number and a virtual debit card are instantly generated which can be used immediately to start transacting and making payments online.New look iMobile: The instant access to the new-looking ‘iMobile’ app comes with a refreshed UI/UX and millennial-friendly language.

Two, it helps pick investment options, out of a list of three, as per the user’s goal and risk profile. 79304113New credit card with curated features: Offering the country's first flexi-plan credit card, ‘ICICI Bank MINE’ enables customers to choose a plan every month in order to suit their lifestyle and monthly requirement. The card also offers multi-brand alliances with key digital brands Amazon, Swiggy, Zomato, Myntra among others and offers cashback of up to 5% on spends on key digital brands.Instant personal loan and overdraft facility: India’s young working generation primarily chooses personal loans for travel to fund their travel plans or to purchase expensive consumer durables.

The bank alleged that the Jaypee group's flagship firm is delaying admission of the insolvency plea by approaching several judicial forums.ICICI Bank further added that the hearing before the Allahabad bench of the NCLT was adjourned almost a dozen times from September 10, 2018, to May 27, 2019, and such adjournments were ""unfairly delaying"" the resolution process.Hearing the matter, a single-member NCLAT bench of Justice Bansi Lal Bhat directed to list ICICI Bank's plea on July 1 for hearing.JAL owes around Rs 1,296 crore and the bank had approached NCLT to recover the dues by filing an insolvency plea against the company under section 7 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). JAL challenged the ICICI Bank petition before the Allahabad high court, but was rejected.Later, JAL moved the Supreme Court, which too refused to stay the application.

Among the home-grown private companies that do not offer paternity leave are India’s biggest private-sector employer TCS, tobacco-to-hotels giant ITC, FMCG player Emami, ICICI Bank and L&T.69747827 The $44-billion Aditya Birla Group recently introduced the benefit for its male employees. Paternity leave is a concept pioneered by Western companies, and tech firms have been at the forefront in providing the most generous paid leaves to new fathers.Some HR heads of private companies argue that it is not necessary to have separate such leave. According to them, a generous privilege leave could double up as paternity leave. Others feel that companies rooted in age-old traditions are slow to adopt New-Age HR policies.TCS said it has a comprehensive leave policy specific to every country, catering to the local needs of its people, including compliance with local laws. TCS, which has 4.24 lakh employees in 46 countries, has the bulk of them based in India. The IT services major added that it has an agile policy development process as “we continuously evolve the policies based on the ever changing requirements”.The $13-billion JSW Group said it offers paternity leave, but it is part of the privilege leave. ICICI Bank didn’t respond to TOI’s mail.At Indian private sector companies, which do offer paternity leave, it’s generally restricted to 7-10 days. On the other hand, the Indian arms of foreign companies offer paternity leave ranging from a few weeks to months. Deutsche Bank India offers “parental leave” of 26 weeks to the primary caregiver, irrespective of the gender. Zomato, which had sacked 300 people in 2015, recently announced a 26-week paternity leave — similar to the mandated maternity leave in the country.Two years ago, there was a proposal to introduce the Paternity Benefit Bill, under which new fathers working in the private sector would get at least 15 days of paternity leave that could be extended to three months. Government provisions allow public sector units to offer 15 days of paternity leave.

Employee transfers are now decided by algorithms, senior manager appraisals are being done by aggregating app-based instant feedback from bosses, and data from canteen purchases is analysed to track employee health.ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar said, “For ICICI, HR automation has been around since 2000. Digitisation is what we have added on top of that by bringing in mobility, connectivity and straight-through processing of everything.” According to Kochhar, if the bank wants its customer engagement to be digital, the channels that employees use internally should also be digital and mobile. “We believe that HR is a huge enabler for all our businesses. So if the enabling environment is not dynamic and agile, then how can the organisation be agile and dynamic?” she said.ICICI Bank HR head T K Srirang said the lender has developed through partnerships and customised applications, which are not available globally. Employees can avail this facility through a mobile application. “We wanted an application that would enable a virtual amphitheatre of 80,000 people. But the only solutions available were webcasts or videoconferences,” he said. While webcast addressed the one-to-many requirement, there was no two-way communication. Videoconferencing allowed two-way communication but could support at most 30 users. A Pune-based developer came with an out-of-the-box solution — a bridge between two applications. This led to the creation of iStudio — which enables Kochhar to address all employees, and those who wish to engage migrate to a videoconferencing mode.Srirang said the solution is useful in a demonetisation-like situation, when employees have to be made mentally ready immediately. It also enables Kochhar make e-visits to branches. The platform is also useful for other employee engagements, like when the bank got a cardiologist to speak to staff on health.Digitising the transfer policy has also helped the lender save senior-manager bandwidth and prevent heartburn. “We have coded all the reasons for transfer requests, post-marriage relocation, health reasons or a transfer to hometown. Based on the weightage, the algorithm identifies the vacancies and prioritises the transfer requests. This has removed discretion, which sometimes acts as a bias,” said Srirang.“Often appraisals are clouded by our recent interaction and that colours, both positively or negatively, leadership assessment. The data from real-time feedback is gold for us as it is immediate, instant and without bias,” said Srirang.Most of the applications are developed rather than purchased. “While for the cloud-based HR management system we have fallen back on Oracle, we find that India has so much talent in development that it gives us an opportunity to do things in-house,” said Srirang.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-automates-hr-with-algorithms/articleshow/63239377.cms

The day’s crash, just around noon, pulled the sensex down by about 700 points or 1.5% with the index dipping from 40,100 level to just a tad below the 39,400 mark in less than half an hour. On the NSE, the nifty crashed about 200 points during the same time. The crash, that came minutes before the Narendra Modi-led new government allocated the ministerial portfolios, were attributed to some errors related to algo trades, although none of the exchanges confirmed the same. Some on the street even attributed the crash to traders’ disappointment with the allocation of some of the ministries, dealers said. However, they ruled out any ‘fat finger’ trade like in 2012.In the forex market, the rupee, after falling for three consecutive sessions, closed stronger by 18 paise at 69.70 to the dollar.Market players are positive on the choice of the new finance minister with Nirmala Sitharaman, a former commerce and defence minister who is also a trained economist, taking charge at the North Block in Delhi. According to Amar Ambani, President & Research Head, Yes Securities, Sitharaman is a good choice since in addition to having a post-graduate degree in economics, she also has experience in the corporate sector, including works in the field of economics. Earlier she also had a brief stint in the finance ministry as a junior minister. She had done justice to the portfolios she had managed earlier and hence the market remains hopeful, Ambani said.During the day’s session, the sensex, after hitting a new all-time high at 40,122, closed at 39,714, down 118 points on the day. Despite the slide in the leading indices, investors’ wealth showed a marginal dip of Rs 12,000 crore, with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 153.7 lakh crore.According to Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking, outside of the leading indices, the broader market indices reflected a mixed picture with BSE midcap outperforming those benchmarks as it closed marginally higher while the smallcap index fell by 0.7%. For the coming week, with a host of high-stake events lined up, market players are taking a cautious stance. “We maintain our cautious stance on the markets at higher levels in the near term. Domestic macro data (that came after the market’s close) and RBI’s monetary policy on June 6 will dictate the market’s trend in the next couple of weeks. Further, global developments, especially with respect to US-China trade talks and movement of crude oil prices will also be constantly monitored,” Manglik said.Among the sensex stocks, ITC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Bank contributed the most to the index’s slide while TCS, Asian Paints and Infosys cushioned the fall to some extent.

Additionally, SoftBank and Alibaba-backed Paytm has been given a target of 5 billion transactions through its payments bank and popular mobile wallet. Private sector lenders HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are expected to chip in with about 2.5 billion and 2.8 billion transactions respectively, according to four people aware of this mandate given to banks and payments platforms. For the financial year ended March 2019, the target was of about 30 billion digital transactions, of which 90-95% was met, these people said.  69529717 As the Modi-led government comes back to power with a bigger mandate than in 2014, it is looking to double down on growth in digital payments and its mass adoption. While banks will play a critical role for digital payments to soar further, mobile wallets and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) are key instruments for the success of digital payments here.“There are new options being considered to take UPI to the masses. If a player like WhatsApp gets the final nod for a full-scale rollout, it would change the way peer-to-peer payments are done,” a person aware of the goings-on said.Among the leading institutions, Paytm is the only entity that has traditionally not been a bank but has one of the largest consumer bases. Other major players in the UPI space, which include Google Pay and Flipkart-owned PhonePe, work with banks to offer the service. To push digital payments, regulatory bodies like the RBI, IRDAI and Sebi are set to come up with regulatory sandboxes to work and test new technologies in the market. While the targets were allocated before the elections, once the swearing-in of new ministers takes place, things will further accelerate, one of the persons aware of the government’s thinking added.Emails sent to the banks, MeitY and Paytm did not elicit any response on the matter. Sources said the estimates are ambitious but achievable as UPI adoption is stronger now and it has emerged as a leading choice of digital payments among top-tier internet users in the metro cities. “Focus on digital payments will only accelerate going forward. It also brings transparency and makes the economy formalised,” said Ankur Pahwa, partner and national leader (e-commerce and consumer internet), EY India. He added UPI will continue to lead the digital payments stack in India. The digital payments estimate covers card-based payments, immediate payment service (IMPS), digital wallets, UPI, national automated clearing house (NACH) and Aadhaar-enabled payment system (AePS). UPI, in the last one year, has seen mercurial growth and it continues to grow even on a higher base now. In March, it saw 800 million transactions through its network even though it saw a marginal dip in volumes at almost 782 million transactions in April.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-eyes-40bn-e-transactions-in-fy20/articleshow/69528900.cms

""In Ind-Ra's opinion, the new government will have to devise and execute both short-term and medium-to-long-term measures to arrest the slowdown.  ""While cyclical challenges can be addressed through short-term measures, the need of the hour is to address the structural challenges plaguing the Indian economy,"" it said.  It further said that although little can be done with regard to the global trade environment, certainly a more proactive policy intervention could be pursued to aggressively revive investment.

The round is expected to be led by existing backer Sequoia Capital India and Ribbit Capital besides China’s Hillhouse Capital in less than one-year-old startup, which rewards customers paying credit card bills through its mobile application. The deal will be one of the rare consumer-facing bets by Tiger Global, which has been actively scouting for deals in business to business (B2B) startups and software companies. The firm, which was an early backer of Flipkart and Ola, is likely to invest $15-20 million in the round but the amount is not yet finalised. “The company is still finalising allocations to various investors and may raise less than $100 million finally. They may also include Hillhouse Capital as one of the new investors,” said one of the sources mentioned above. Shah and Tiger Global declined to comment when contacted by TOI. Shah had earlier started recharge and bill payments platform Freecharge, which was acquired by online marketplace Snapdeal for $400 million back in 2015 in what was the largest acquisitions in the startup space at that time. Last year, Cred had raised $25 million led by Sequoia Capital India and Ribbit Capital along with RPT Ventures, Yuri Milner’s Apoletto Asia and China’s Morningside Ventures at a valuation of about $70 million. Cred along with online stock brokerage Upstox and neo-banking startup Open are the other fin-tech deals that Tiger Global deals that the firm is working on. The investor interest Cred, which launched the in November, comes as the credit card space has been seeing a slew of moves from India’s largest internet companies. Last week, ride-hailing major Ola announced a credit card with SBI while mobile payments major Paytm launched a credit card along with Visa and Citibank. Amazon India has also launched a credit card with ICICI Bank while Flipkart is also planning to launch one. The idea for these companies is to lock-in their most affluent customers with incentives and also get insights on their spending elsewhere, as all these companies build a payment business.

One of the most influential investors, the firm","BENGALURU: The New York-headquartered Tiger Global Management, which has invested over $2.2 billion in India by being an early backer of companies like online retailer Flipkart and ride-hailing major Ola, is rewriting the rules of investments in startups again. One of the most influential investors, the firm has closed four deals this quarter and is in talks with at least five others. The discussions are in software as a service (SaaS), business-to-business (B2B) commerce and financial technology (fintech) sectors — away from the hyper-competitive consumer internet segment, which has attracted most of the capital till now. The latest deal on Tiger Global’s radar is Cred, a fintech company started by serial entrepreneur Kunal Shah, which is raising up to $100 million at a $400-million valuation, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Tiger Global is expected to invest $15-20 million in one of the most sought after startups, which rewards customers paying credit card bills through its mobile application.  69404597 The charge for dealmaking is being led by new global head of private investments Scott Shleifer, who took over after previous head Lee Fixel — who had also been leading India deals over the last decade, quit unexpectedly in March.Under Fixel, many believe that Tiger Global was responsible for developing the online commerce market by aggressively writing large cheques and bringing its global learnings to India. This pace of activity by Tiger Global, soon after a top-level personnel change, has surprised many in the startup ecosystem and is reminiscent of aggressive dealmaking by the firm in consumer internet and hyper-local delivery space in 2014-15, according to about a dozen entrepreneurs and investors TOI spoke to for this article. “They were the first ones to identify the consumer internet theme. Now they are latching onto a new theme, which is B2B,” said Anand Lunia, founder of early stage investment firm India Quotient, adding that Tiger’s focus could bring more capital to the sector. “All the funds that were focusing on early stage investments in the software space were not able to find support at a later stage.” Take for instance its biggest investment till now — $90 million in Bengaluru-based NinjaCart, which is building a supply chain between farmers and retailers. The deal increased the valuation of the four-year-old company by more than three and a half times to $320 million, from about $89 million some months ago in December.But it was the pace at which Tiger Global moved that is surprising for B2B startups. The deal with Tiger Global for NinjaCart closed in less than four weeks, while its previous financing round of $35 million had taken four-five months, according to sources briefed on the matter. “They did the highest level of due diligence, but it happened very fast. Tiger met our customers, farmers, and visited some collection centres,” said Thirukumaran Nagarajan, co-founder and CEO of NinjaCart. Tiger Global is also a major investor in China’s Meicai, which has a model like NinjaCart. A similar story is playing out in the software space in Zenoti, a Hyderabad- and Seattle-based company that provides solutions for spas and salons with majority revenues coming from the US. The startup was looking to raise capital since December. But it did not think that Tiger Global would be interested, given that the size of the market it is addressing is just $10 billion and not $100-200 billion like CRM (customer relationship management), said one of the sources briefed on the matter. “Tiger Global reached out to them and gave a valuation that was at least 40% higher than what they were getting from other investors. They closed the transaction in less than six weeks,” said the source mentioned earlier, adding that Zenoti was valued at $260 million when Tiger led a $50-million round. What has changed for Tiger Global since 2014-15, when it was the only major big investor in India internet, is the increased activity of Japan’s SoftBank and South Africa’s Naspers, as well as Chinese majors like Alibaba, Xiaomi and Tencent. Moreover, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio is in consumer internet segments, catering to mass market. “Investors are increasingly realising that if they back mass market plays, they will need enough capital to compete with these strategic players. And while Flipkart was a great exit, this is also a lesson for Tiger Global from it,” said a founder who has recently interacted with the firm.

Adugodi police arrested Kishore Kumar, 28, a resident of B Chandrappa Nagar, and Rakesh, 37, of Vishwapriya Nagar. Kishore worked with a cash logistics firm and was tasked with fixing defunct ATMs. Last year, Rakesh, a cab driver, had raised a loan of Rs 20 lakh to start a hotel business, but the venture failed within a few days. Kishore, a close friend of Rakesh, decided to help him. The duo decided to steal cash from ATM kiosks.On May 1, Kishore went to an ICICI Bank ATM kiosk on Langford Road and an RBL Bank ATM kiosk on Residency Road and cut their wires and disabled their transactions. He knew that both the ATMs were to be refilled the same day. Kishore, who was assigned to fix the ATMs, received the One Time Passwords (OTPs) to open the cash vending machines. After he got the OTPs, Kishore took away Rs 47.8 lakh from the ICICI Bank ATM and Rs 51.3 lakh from RBL Bank ATM.Rakesh had brought his car in which they transported the cash to three rooms which they had rented to hoard the money.The banks informed the cash logistics firm about the missing cash. Kishore was the first suspect as he had stopped coming to work from the next day.On going through CCTV footage near the ATM kiosks, police found that Kishore and Rakesh were involved in the heist. Police said the duo divided the cash and stored them in three different locations. While Kishore stored Rs 47,83,000 in Bommanahalli and Rakesh Rs 30,00,000 in Vishwapriya Nagar, Begur and Rs 17,70,000 in Viratnagar in Bommanahalli. Police said they are yet to recover Rs 3.6 lakh from the accused, who are claiming they put the money in a temple hundi (cash collection box). Cops are yet to establish the veracity of the claim.Kishore and Rakesh are unmarried and thick friends.

MTR alleged that the total consideration for the restaurant sale and assignment of the brand was Rs 1.5 crore, while the assets and turnover of Maiyas Restaurants were Rs 14.5 crore and Rs 33 crore respectively.MTR was among the bidders for Maiyas. The bid was finally won by Akashika Foods, a firm formed by employees of Maiyas and backed by Sadananda Maiya. Akashika had submitted a Rs 130-crore plan to revive the beleaguered Maiyas.Maiyas’ committee of creditors led by Karnataka Bank had opposed MTR’s application against Maiyas. Karnataka Bank and ICICI Bank have an exposure of Rs 77 crore and Rs 3 crore respectively to Maiyas Beverages and Foods.

Renascent Power Ventures Pvt Ltd, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Resurgent Power Ventures Pte, has acquired 75 per cent stake in Prayagraj Power Generation Co Ltd (PPGCL) which owns and operates 1,980 MW coal-based electricity generation unit, Tata Power said in a regulatory filing.  Resurgent Power is a joint venture of ICICI Bank and Tata Power, while PPGCL is a subsidiary of Gaur's Jaiprakash Power Ventures Ltd which has been shedding assets to cut debt.  It has sold power projects of about 3,800 MW capacity in the last few years to settle debt of close to Rs 21,000 crore.  Gaur will not get any money from the sale despite putting in Rs 3,000 crore equity.  His group had last sold two hydroelectric projects -- 300 MW Baspa Stage-II and 1,091 MW Karcham Wangtoo in Himachal Pradesh -- to Sajjan Jindal-controlled JSW Energy Ltd for Rs 9,700 crore in cash.  After these sales, Jaiprakash Power Ventures has three more power plants with 2,200 MW electricity generation capacity.  PPGCL had a total debt of Rs 11,000 crore and Renascent has agreed to takeover Rs 6,000 crore.

The balance 74 per cent stake in Resurgent is held by ICICI Bank, Power Platform Ltd and Kuwait Investment Authority.  The coal-fired power plant currently operates at 62 per cent of capacity or plant load factor (PLF).  It was won by Jaypee Group through competitive bidding, quoting a tariff of Rs 3.06 per unit.  A case for reduction in electricity tariff was made because of reduction in the debt, but the Appellate Tribunal For Electricity (APTEL) didn't allow it in September order.  Gaur has taken a hit of Rs 3,000 crore on sale of the power plant.

Assam Co went to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) last year following a loan default. Sources close to the development said that a new claim of ICICI Bank in the UK to the tune of $41.6 million (Rs 280 crore) has surfaced which was not part of the committee of creditors' (CoC) claim as admitted by the resolution professional.The UK arm of ICICI Bank has said the outstanding balance of $41.6 million which it had claimed that the bank owed under a 2007 loan provided to Assam Oil Co Ltd, the main holding company of ACIL.The extended last date for submitting bids is June 27. It was earlier extended to June 21, but following an appeal at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) by James Warren Tea, the timeframe was further extended for a week.ACL, now owned by Aditya Kumar Jajodia, has 14 gardens in Assam with a total production capacity of over 10 million kg a year. Moreover, it has an oil and gas block in Amguri, which is under Assam Oil. AIL Holding and Cromwell Securities were the guarantors of the loan. As per shareholding pattern of Assam Company, Cromwell Securities and Assam Oil are two largest shareholders of ACIL. These two companies taken together have 39.5% stake in ACIL out of 42% promoters' stake in the tea-to-oil player. It is learnt that at least eight companies would submit resolution plan for Assam Co. They are: Apeejay Group, Dhunseri Tea, Luxmi Group, Warren Tea, James Warren Tea, The Chatterjee Group (TCG) and two asset reconstruction companies. The new financial claim may change the valuation of Assam Co altogether. The bid is likely to be opened on July 3, however, some of the bidders conditioning anonymity has opined that the bids should be opened in front of lenders in order to maintain transparency. Akhil Ruia, CEO of James Warren Tea for whom the last date for submission of bid was extended, told TOI on Friday that it has already deposited Rs 5 crore earnest money for submitting the resolution plan. The resolution professional (RP) to ACL, Kannan Tiruvengadam, admitted the claim amount of Rs 1,359 crore from financial creditors and Rs 149 crore from operational creditors. The SBI has the largest share in the debt and the highest voting share in the CoC, followed by Srei Infrastructure, Indian Overseas Bank, Bank of Baroda., Allahabad Bank, Union Bank of India, Central Bank, ICICI Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Syndicate Bank. ICICI Bank has a voting rights of 3.5% with admitted claims of Rs 47.3 crore. Sources added that the UK arm of ICICI Bank has alleged that Assam Oil & Gas failed to repay the full amount owed under the loan and struggled to meet interest payments during 2009. According to the claim, Assam Oil has repaid $10 million of the loan when it was due at the end of 2011 and again failed to fully repay the debt under an amended facility agreement governed by the British Law. A legal expert opined that the ICICI Bank claim in the UK may have a bearing on Assam Company as the loan has been taken by the largest shareholder of the company and ACIL is also a guarantor. ====================Box# Assam Oil, the defaulter of loan at the UK arm of ICICI Bank, is the main holding firm of Assam Co (ACIL)# ACIL is a guarantor for the loan along with another holding firm Cromwell Securities# This amount was not part of admitted claim of the ACIL lenders of Rs 1359 cr during its resolution process# ACIL admitted to NCLT last year for loan default; the last date of submission of bid is now June 27# ICICI Bank has a voting right of 3.5% with admitted claims of Rs 47.3 crore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-uk-arm-seeks-41-6m-from-assam-co-holding-firm/articleshow/64704529.cms

The agency has asked Chanda Kochhar to appear before the investigating officer on May 3 at the agency’s headquarters in New Delhi, thus moving the probe from its Mumbai zonal office to the national capital.The high profile case has assumed significance with the agency gathering more information on alleged complicity of the former CEO in loans granted by the bank to several corporate houses where allegations of quid pro quo against her husband have surfaced. Deepak Kochhar, the founder director of NuPower Renewables, is under the scanner for having received Rs 325 crore investment in his company from two Mauritius-based entities. The transaction trails of these investments link them to Dhoot who allegedly remitted the amount as part of a quid pro quo for ICICI Bank extending credit of around Rs 3,600 crore to his group companies.The CBI, which first registered an FIR in the case, had alleged that Chanda Kochhar cheated ICICI Bank in criminal conspiracy with other accused by sanctioning loans to the Videocon group.

The,"NEW DELHI: Paytm, the country’s largest payments platform has partnered with ICICI Bank, the largest private bank by assets, to jointly launch a digital credit facility. This partnership will enable millions of Paytm customers to avail instant credit for various purposes including bill payments, flight tickets or consumer durables.The credit facility ‘Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid’ is a digital credit account with instant online activation: without documentation or branch visit. There are no fees on the transaction.“We believe our customers are sincere with their payments and Paytm Postpaid will play a major role in helping them pay for their daily expenses on time. This will democratize access to credit including those with less disposable income,” said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and CEO, Paytm.The credit facility will be based on a new Big Data based algorithm by ICICI Bank for real-time credit assessment of customers. The software uses a combination of financial and digital behaviour of the customer including credit bureau check, purchase patterns, frequency of purchase to ascertain the credit – worthiness of a customer within a few seconds. Based on the credit-score of the customer, the bank offers up to 45 days interest-free credit limit. It ranges from Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000, extendable up to Rs 20,000 based on the repayment history. Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid will also offer a quick checkout to customers with the Paytm Passcode.The facility is currently available only to customers of ICICI Bank using the Paytm app. It will shortly be available to non-ICICI Bank customers using the Paytm app.Once the credit limit is set up for a customer, a consolidated bill is generated on the first day of the next month, which has to be paid by the 15th day of the same month.“We are now witnessing two distinct new trends: One, many customers—who are new-to-credit and therefore, do not have a credit history-- are looking for short term credit. Two, millions of young Indians are now buying products online. We have combined these two insights to bring out a novel proposition of giving short term credit to people,” said Anup Bagchi, ED, ICICI Bank.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-to-offer-small-instant-credit-to-paytm-users/articleshow/61676293.cms

The bank’s auto loan portfolio stood at Rs 56,000 crore as of December, which is almost 28% of the nearly Rs 2 lakh crore of auto loans outstanding in the banking sector.According to ICICI Bank executive director Anup Bagchi, the large retail depositor base has helped to grow the portfolio. Even though auto sales have not been increasing, the lender has managed to increase the share of financed car and two-wheeler purchases. “Because we have the borrowers’ deposit accounts, we know the steadiness of their income and their outgo. This, coupled with credit bureau information, which provides their repayment track record, enables us to instantly score the customer and sanction the loans without human intervention,” said Bagchi.By running its analytics software on its customer base, ICICI Bank has already approved 20 lakh account holders to avail the final sanction letter of a car loan instantly and digitally up to Rs 20 lakh for a tenure of up to seven years. It has also approved 1.2 crore customers for an ‘Insta Two-Wheeler Loan’, up to Rs 2 lakh for a tenure of up to three years. Both the facilities will offer 100% of the on-road price of the vehicle.“The Insta auto loan has removed congestion in the credit delivery process and has actually shifted the power to the customer,” Bagchi said. Another distinction in the Insta auto loan is that the borrower can get a loan for more than 100% of the vehicle value as it covers the entire on-road cost.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/automated-lending-drives-vehicle-credit-in-icici/articleshow/68929593.cms

Nigel Tozzi QC, representing the banks, said the banks did not accept that the judgment debt was secured in India and when and if the offer would be approved was uncertain.Handing down judgment on Wednesday, Master Cook (the judge) said: “I adjourn the hearing of the application for a third party debt order to after the hearing of the bankruptcy petition in December.”He said the interim third party debt order would remain in force.Cook said he found that “it was not material for the court to know of the bankruptcy petition at this stage” nor of the Karnataka HC offer. The judge was also not convinced Mallya was suffering hardship and said: “he has not made any application for a hardship order”.He said the bankruptcy proceedings were only relevant to whether the order should be made final. “In this case the grounds for making an interim debt order were strong. There was an undisputed and unpaid judgment for a substantial sum of money.”At the April 3 hearing the court had heard that Mallya owed his personal assistant £84,000 (Rs 76 lakh) and a business acquaintance £128,000 (Rs 1.15 crore). He also owes £267,000 (Rs 2.41 crore) in taxes to HMRC and his preference was to use the £259,000 to pay these creditors off. He also owes an undisclosed sum to his previous lawyers, Macfarlanes, and £175,000 (Rs 1.58 crore) in costs to the Indian banks for an earlier case. But yet he spends £1,000 (Rs 90,000) a week on groceries.Cook said given there were supporting creditors and other people who may be affected by the bankruptcy proceedings, adding, “The proper thing to do is to adjourn.”“I note that Dr Mallya has made no voluntary payment to date and has failed to pay the costs order against him made in August 2018 whilst continuing to incur substantial legal costs in opposing the claimants’ efforts to enforce their judgment,” the judge said. He said, “whether the judgment debt is effectively secured by the attachments made in India must be left to the hearing of the bankruptcy petition”. He said there was one supporting creditor — Investec to whom Mallya owes £3.4 million (Rs 30 crore) — and there were “likely to be other creditors.”Mallya, meanwhile, took to Twitter to say, “Every time that I say I am willing to pay 100 per cent back to the PSU bank, media say I am spooked, terrified etc. of extradition. I am willing to pay either way whether I am in London or an Indian jail. Why don’t the banks take the money I offered first? ...

As many as 137 Ghaziabad residents have become victims in such cases in the first three months of this year itself — more than half the number of cases recorded in all of 2018. Last year, 251 FIRs were lodged across the city in cases related to financial fraud. Data provided by city police says, 102 cases under IPC Section 420 and Information Technology Act had been lodged in 2017. The number rose to more than double last year. 68896922 Ghaziabad SSP Upendra Kumar Agarwal said: “Not only illiterates, but also well-educated and those working in big companies are also becoming victims of cyber fraud. UP Police has launched a mobile application (UP Cop) through which people can file complaints related to cyber fraud. It’s one of the reasons that numbers (of FIRs) are rising. But the most important aspect is awareness. People need to know that personal details should not be shared with anyone.”He added that the department is planning to seek more police personnel and better infrastructure to probe such cases. “Now, only an inspector-level officer can probe IT Act-related cases. Those who are working in crime branch are already overburdened. When crimes are happening across the country, one cannot expect speedy probe.”Baljeet Singh, former in-charge, cyber crime cell, Ghaziabad, said: “Debit card cloning is not just restricted to ATM kiosks. It’s done at petrol pumps, restaurants and malls where cards are given for swiping. Another modus operandi is that a caller makes a person reveal card details on the pretext of monetary offer or a threat of his or her debit or credit card being blocked. People are made to install mobile applications that can be used to access the phones remotely. Everyone using a card or making online transactions is vulnerable. One needs to be alert all the time and keep changing password or PIN.” In Ghaziabad, Indirapuram police station has reported the maximum number of FIRs in the past three years. While 16 cases were registered in 2017, 51 cases came in 2018 and 32 were recorded till March this year. In a recent case, on April 10, around 9.15 pm, a resident of Sector-2 Vasundhara, Manoj Nayar, who has a credit card from ICICI bank got four messages within a minute saying transactions worth Rs 1,48,000 had been made through his card. It listed shopping in Switzerland, Kolkata (West Bengal), Hubli (Karnataka) and Surat (Gujrat). The card was blocked immediately.Police said one should not let a card go out of sight while using it in restaurants, malls and shops. One should not share card details with any caller. While making online transactions, it is better to visit a company’s website and login. The police said one should check account balance regularly and notify fraudulent activities immediately.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/its-only-april-but-cyber-fraud-cases-already-half-of-those-registered-last-year/articleshow/68896923.cms

But","NEW DELHI: The government is looking to claw back bonuses and other benefits that accrued to ousted top executives of IL&FS Group, who are accused of failing to discharge their duties and leaving the entity in a financial mess.The government had put in place a new board, led by Kotak Mahindra Bank vice-chairman and CEO Uday Kotak to run the affairs, citing mismanagement. But with probe by the Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO) pointing to major irregularities in case of IL&FS Financial Services (I-Fin), the government is looking at clawing back bonuses and other benefits that accrued to several top executives in the group that has liabilities of Rs 91,000 crore to the financial system. 68883078 The approach is similar to the one adopted by ICICI Bank against Chanda Kochhar, who was forced to quit amid serious charges of irregularities, involving her husband Deepak Kochhar in loans sanctioned by India’s top private bank. She has been asked to return the bonuses and shares, which were given as part of the ESOP scheme.  67764942 The move at IL&FS is part of a drive that will focus on the role of key management personnel, such as former IL&FS chairman Ravi Parthasarthy, former vice-chairman Hari Shankaran and I-Fin chief Ramesh Bawa, sources told TOI. While several other executives are under the scanner, Shankaran and Bawa have been arrested by the SFIO, which has alleged irregularities.In addition, the sources said, the role of independent directors is also suspect as they are seen to have played ball with the management and not raised doubts. Besides, Deloitte is being probed minutely as the auditor had failed to detect any irregularities. Already some executives have been questioned by authorities.Given the massive web of companies at IL&FS, estimated at over 250, the SFIO is looking at four major blocks, with its investigation related to I-Fin nearing completion. After this, the focus will shift to the parent and its power arm, apart from IL&FS Transportation Network (ITNL), sources said. At the same time, the board is looking to sell several subsidiaries to recover money, given that several of the assets in the group’s portfolio may not result in significant recovery.“There are several instances of gold-plating of assets, resulting in more loans having been disbursed to the entities,” alleged a source, who did not wish to be identified. Already, the government has told the National Company Law Tribunal that there was ever-greening and irregularities with the financial services arm I-Fin, which released funds to several groups, when some of the group companies were NPAs. In some cases, relaxation was also given in creating a charge on assets and loans were given citing “past relationship”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bonus-clawback-plan-for-ilfs-executives/articleshow/68880862.cms

In the February policy review as well the repo rate was slashed by a similar quantum.However, after the governor Shaktikanta Das publicly asking them to do more to pass rate cuts to the borrowers, bankers affirmed their commitment to work on the same.""The downward revisions in GDP and inflation projections reveal the near-term global headwinds, and lower- than-anticipated rainfall may add to more uncertainties,"" SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar warned.Regulatory decisions, which Kumar welcomed, include the decision to categorise additional 2 per cent of excess SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) for LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) which will release additional liquidity into the system.It is a ""forward-looking policy"" which caters to market participants' demands, Kumar added.Industry lobby Indian Banks Association chairman Sunil Mehta said the latest rate cut on top of a similar move in February, coupled with the moves on easing liquidity will help banks with faster transmission.He further said the lowering of the inflation forecast also provides further comfort.

This ended a four-session rally that had taken the index above the 39k mark to an all-time high. A lower-than-normal monsoon could, among other issues, spike food price inflation, which may lead to a higher interest rate in the economy and could also result in reduced rural demand. During the day’s early session, the sensex had scaled a new high at 39,270 points. But in the closing hours, the monsoon predictions of 93% of long-term average left Dalal Street traders jittery, market players said. As a result, the sensex dipped to an intra-day low of 38,827 — a drop of over 400 points from its high mark.However, a report by Barclays India said that 93% of normal monsoon may not be too adverse an outcome. Second, research shows that in the last five years, food price inflation averaged around 4% annually despite adverse weather conditions during at least two years, the bank’s chief India economist Siddhartha Sanyal said. “The demand-supply balance for food products in India has improved significantly in recent years, which has reduced the country’s vulnerability to weather shocks,” Sanyal said.Stocks that had in the recent past witnessed strong gains led the day’s slide, with Reliance Industries, L&T and ICICI Bank succumbing to strong selling.

However, in the longer run, it is seen as a negative for bad loan recovery.Shares of public sector banks, which have an exposure to the power sector, rose on Tuesday as the likelihood of having to make additional provisions on power sector loans have come down. Shares of SBI closed 1.8% higher and Yes Bank rose 1.7%. Other lenders Axis Bank and Bank of Baroda also registered gains. But shares of ICICI Bank slipped marginally.Rating agency Moody’s, however, saw the Supreme Court order delaying resolution of stressed assets. This is because in some cases where proceedings were initiated under the quashed February 12 circular of the RBI, lenders would have to start the process afresh.RBI norms require that banks make 50% provisions towards loans that are referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for recovery under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Considering that loans worth Rs 3.8 lakh crore were impacted by the February 12, 2018 circular, banks have been looking at substantial provisioning.“We believe that the development will be negative for lenders and may prolong the recovery phase for the banks. It also adds to uncertainty on the existing accounts’ classification, provision requirements, etc. Also, further clarity on the loan-restructuring and other debt -recovery / -resolution processes by the regulatory authorities will be keenly watched out for,” said Lalitabh Shrivastawa, AVP (research) at Sharekhan BNP Paribas.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sc-ruling-may-help-banks-gain-in-the-short-term/articleshow/68696155.cms

Soonawala, a financial wizard, had joined Tata Sons in 1968 from ICICI (now ICICI Bank). In a statement, Ratan Tata expressed his gratitude to Soonawala for “his colleagueship over the years”.While Soonawala, a bachelor, doesn’t own any equity shares of Tata Sons, he holds nearly 9% of its preference share capital.

The case is pending before the appellate tribunal after the lower tribunal found no merit in the argument.Over the past weeks, the Trusts has been seeing changes at the trusteeship level.

Immediately after the bank ","The shares of ICICI Bank jumped by more than 5 percent on Tuesday, soon after the private lender announced the Q4 results. Immediately after the bank declared its results, the global brokerage firms increased their target price on the shares. ICICI Bank reported around 50 percent on-year drop in its net profit of Rs 1,020 crore for the quarter ending in March 2018. It was noted that the net profit for Q4FY17 was somewhere near Rs 2,024.60 crore.The bank rose by 7 percent to Rs 309 on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) after it declared better than expected operating performance.Net profit of the bank went down by almost half, to Rs 10.2 billion, for the fourth quarter ended in March, as it kept aside cash to cover a rise in bad loans, which was caused by fallout of the central bank’s revised scheme on resolution of stressed assets. It reported a profit of Rs 20.2 billion in the same quarter previous year.The net interest margin improved to 3.24% in Q4 of 2018 compared to 3.14% in Q3 of 2018.However, stress pool came off to more than 3 percent. Additionally, the operating performance exceeded expectation in domestic loan growth of less than 15 percent with NIM improvement (despite higher stress) led to NII beat.The bank has been very carefully de‐risking its balance sheet and hoping to step this up by FY20.

In addition to key factors, such as profitability, gross non-performing loans, loan growth and provisions review on the controversy around chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar is awaited. In the meeting that will be held to approve the bank’s March quarter earnings, shareholders expect the bank board to clarify on conflict-of-interest allegations raised against Kochhar.Investors will look forward to the provisions the bank makes with regard to non-performing loans (NPLs). This is pretty similar to another private sector banking major, Axis Bank that reported a net loss of Rs 21.8 billion for the quarter ended March 2018, as non-performing assets (NPAs) increased and provisions for bad loans jumped three times over the same quarter last year.Moreover, the numbers will be go up against because of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registering a preliminary enquiry (PE) against ICICI Bank Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar, officials of the Videocon group and others to determine there has been malpractices involving the sanctioning of Rs 32.5 billion loan to the Videocon Group by the ICICI Bank as part of a consortium of banks in 2012.On a year-to-date basis, the stock has dropped by 9 percent and has underperformed the Nifty Bank index that earned nearly 1 percent in this period, ACE Equity data shows. In comparison, the Nifty50 index is also up 1 percent year to date.ICICI Bank is likely to report a drop in its fiscal fourth-quarter because of higher scope for bad loans. As per a poll of 18 analysts carried out by Bloomberg, the bank is expected to announce a profit of Rs 1,060 crore for the March quarter. In the December quarter, the bank had reported a net profit of Rs 1,650 crore. Increase in bad loans and provisioning for accounts referred under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is expected to keep the credit cost higher. But, the bank’s pre-provisioning operation profit for the fourth quarter is helped by a rise in non-interest income, which is likely to gain from ICICI Bank’s stake sale in ICICI Securities.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-q4fy18-result-preview-heres-what-to-expect/articleshow/64060033.cms

ICICI,2018-04-10T07:10:00+05:30,TNN,ICICI Bank faces governance issue: Fitch,"Business News: “A significant portion of the (Videocon) loan has since become non-performing. The presence of the bank’s CEO on this credit committee, and the bank’s","MUMBAI: Rating agency Fitch has said that the ongoing investigation in the Chanda Kochhar-led ICICI Bank could undermine investor confidence, with potential implications for funding costs and liquidity in an extreme scenario. However, the bank’s status as a systemically important bank will ensure that it benefits from some form of state support.Meanwhile, there is a potential risk of financial penalties, as well as legal action, if the investigation comes up with findings against the bank, the agency said. According to Fitch, if the investigations expose misconduct, it will throw into question the rating agency’s assumptions that corporate governance at private banks, such as ICICI, is generally stronger than at state-owned banks due to better-qualified board members and more professional management. Moreover, compensation structures at private banks are more performance-oriented, while a large and diversified investor base encourages greater management accountability.Analysts, meanwhile, are cautioning that the investigations might hit the bank’s stock price. “Till further clarity emerges, the development will be an overhang for the stock. Already, the news of tepid response to IPO of ICICI Securities has dented sentiments,” said an analyst report from Sharekhan. However, the report also pointed out that the bank has several positives in place including a strong capital position, stable net interest margins and an opportunity to grow market share.Shares of ICICI Bank opened sharply lower at Rs 279 but gained in the second half and finally closed at Rs 280, almost unchanged. Fitch currently has a BBB- rating, which places the bank at the edge of investment grade. The allegation relates to a $500-million loan to Videocon Group, whose controlling shareholder co-founded a separate company with the spouse of ICICI’s CEO.“A significant portion of the (Videocon) loan has since become non-performing. The ICICI’s board has denied any wrongdoing, highlighting that the loan was underwritten in accordance with the bank’s credit standards and was extended as part of a consortium involving over 20 banks. The bank has stressed that it has not given any credit to the borrower group outside of the consortium. The presence of the bank’s CEO on this credit committee, and the bank’s reluctance to support an independent probe, have created doubts over the strength of its corporate governance practice,” the rating agency said.The allegations come against a backdrop of high non-performing assets in the banking sector, some of which have been linked to fraudulent lending.“Fitch will closely monitor developments, and would take appropriate rating action if risks to the banks’ reputation and financial profile were to rise considerably,” the rating agency said. On the positive side, ICICI Bank has relatively strong capitalisation and profitability. Core capitalisation was 14.2% in December 2017, among the highest in the sector.

The SIM card was subsequently used by fraudsters to siphon off Rs 7.8 lakh using net banking. Dattatraya Utekar was a victim of a SIM-swap fraud where criminals managed to activate a new SIM card with his number in July 2015. The fraudsters had managed to do this by getting a SIM card from Tata Docomo using fraudulent documents. The telecom company had argued that the dispute was with the bank (ICICI Bank). The company said that money could not have been siphoned out without a login id or password and neither were provided by the telecom company. ICICI Bank said it had a three-level security feature which included the grid value on the reverse of the debit card. In its order issued on Thursday, the court said: ""ICICI Bank seems to have followed proper guidelines and security measures in this case. It would be only right to state that the reversal of amount fraudulently transferred would have been possible to a large extent provided the SIM card was active. In the final analysis, it is the negligence on the part of respondent no. 2 (Tata DoCoMo) that has led to this fraudulent transaction.""

In this fast changing ecosystem, where angels are investing much higher amounts, the increase is expected provide more opportunities to angel funds.  The Sebi board has approved amendments to Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) regulations with respect to Angel Funds'.  The decision is based on the recommendations of its working group, Sebi said in a statement.  The markets regulator had formed a working group comprising of various angel networks, consultants and startups, to look at simplifying certain provisions of AIFs to provide ease of doing business for angel funds.  Angel funds, a sub-category AIFs, encourage entrepreneurship by financing small startups at a stage when they find it difficult to obtain capital from traditional sources of finance such as banks and financial institutions.  Under the amendment, Sebi will increase the maximum investment by angel funds in venture capital undertakings to Rs 10 crore from the current Rs 5 crore.  However, the minimum investment by an angel investor will continue to be Rs 25 lakh.  Further, Sebi would halve the minimum corpus size required for an angel fund to register with it to Rs 5 crore.  Besides, the regulator would raise the maximum period of accepting funds from an angel investor to five years, from three years. The move will provide angel funds more time to identify opportunities and invest in venture capital firms.  The requirement of filing of scheme memorandum to Sebi by angel funds will be replaced with the requirement of filing term sheet containing material information, as specified by the regulator within 10 days of launching the scheme.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said the provisions of the Companies Act will apply to the Angel fund, if it is formed as a company.  In addition, the regulator has decided to put in place a consultation paper for reviewing norms pertaining to buyback and SAST (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) regulations with an objective of simplifying the language, removing redundant provisions and inconsistencies, updating the references to the Companies Act and other Sebi rules.  An important amendment proposed in Takeover Regulations is granting of additional time for upward revision of open offer price, the regulator noted.  Moreover, the board has revised the provisions relating to transfer of listed securities.  It has decided that requests for effecting transfer of listed securities will not be processed unless the securities are held in the dematerialized form with a depository. The measure is aimed at curbing fraud and manipulation risk in physical transfer of securities by unscrupulous entities.  According to Sebi, transfer of securities only in demat form will improve ease, convenience and safety of transactions for investors.  The Sebi board has also decided to include the option of distribution of cash benefits like dividends through depositories, in addition to the present system of distribution directly by the listed companies or through their Registrar to an issue and Share Transfer Agents.  The option will widen the choice for investors with its benefits such as shorter turnaround time for receiving benefits, ability to get consolidated statements of all such benefits and to receive alerts (SMS or e-mails).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-decides-to-ease-rules-for-angel-funds-to-boost-startup-funding/articleshow/63519527.cms

This suggests that, unless food prices reverse sharply or inflation suddenly surges, there could be space for another rate cut in the current easing cycle,"" HDFC Bank's Abheek Barua said.""The sharp lowering of inflation forecast can enable further policy easing in April,"" ICICI Bank's B Prasanna said.There is an emphasis on the need to support growth if inflation objectives are achieved and the MPC noted that the slack in the economy is rising, Prasanna said.Indian Banks Association chairman and the head of Punjab National Bank Sunil Mehta said Das' maiden policy has a big positive effect on the banking sector.Standard Chartered's Zarin Daruwala said the RBI has been supplying liquidity through sustained OMOs and with this rate cut, there could be a moderation in borrowing rates.""Overall, the intent is growth supporting and to alleviate the fear of liquidity deficit from the market,"" Bank of India's Dinabandhu Mohapatra, said.According to Bandhan Bank's CS Ghosh, today's rate cut will help boost credit flow and also drive consumption.SBI's Kumar said there are several innovative announcements in the policy apart from a rate cut that can potentially trigger a new paradigm for financial markets.The decision to rationalise risk weights for on- lending to rated-NBFCs will enable better price discovery, lower capital requirement and facilitate better credit flow from banks to them, he said.""This will enable stronger/well rated NBFCs to raise more funds at competitive price,"" Mohapatra said.The central bank also raised the limit of collateral free agriculture loan from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.60 lakh.Mohapatra said it will enhance coverage of small and marginal farmers in formal banking system and will help in growth of agricultural activities and agrarian economy.Daruwala said providing banks with increased flexibility on bulk deposits is a welcome move and will assist them in better managing their asset liability mismatches.Kumar said opening up the ECB route for applicants under the IBC could facilitate a faster turnaround.

According to executive search firms, there is a growing trend of firms putting several such clawback clauses while hiring senior executives. “When you have a potent combination of various levers to drive performance and delivery — including performance-led incentivesand benefits and perks — it is bound to introduce enhanced complexities in the total annual payout design,” said Hunt Partners managing partner Suresh Raina. “At the time of departure, all the annual, term-bound payouts come into consideration and need a deft and creative handling. The sums involved are large (some are upwards of $75,000) and become a retention tool. Yet the talent hunt leaves few options for the hiring company to find a way to compensate the candidate and, by the time you are done, it looks like a financial contract and less of an employment contract,” added Raina.ICICI Bank’s compensation policy and contracts, which govern its whole-time directors and senior employees, has a provision of clawback of certain compensation benefits, said an ICICI Bank spokesperson.Clawback clauses are entered in contracts for a service or benefit provided to an employee, for which the employee has to ensure reciprocity for a certain period, said Mahindra & Mahindra EVP (group human capital & leadership development) Prince Augustin. Executive Access MD Ronesh Puri said some companies even peg the amount to be clawed back at double of what they would spend on learning and development (L&D) of a senior executive. This comes even as more companies send their senior executives abroad for L&D programmes. “Since such programmes are expensive, companies do not want to lose the trained talent to competition. A clause to claw back the amount if the executive leaves soon after a stipulated period serves as a retention tool,” said Puri.At junior levels, employers try to achieve a clawback by way of a training bond. Here, the employee is asked to reimburse the expenses incurred by the employer for imparting training if he does not successfully complete a service commitment. For managerial level positions, the clawback mechanism is structured on the basis of additional payouts (such as bonus or ex gratia) being made to the employee, especially in cases of breach of the code of conduct or employment terms. “In the practical sense and in a country like India, it remains a challenge for the employer to recover such amounts at the time of the employee’s exit, especially if the amounts are higher than the full and final settlement. Unlike the US where the law (section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) allows for clawback for financial misstatements, some of the similar mechanisms adopted by employers are likely to be tested in courts, especially if found to be punitive or unreasonable in nature,” said Nishith Desai Associates leader (HR law) Vikram Shroff.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cos-ensure-payback-if-execs-flout-norms/articleshow/67876321.cms

Jaitley had on Sunday accused Kharge of dissenting excessively, saying he had made the appointment of CBI director look like a political battle which was never envisaged. He was referring to Kharge writing to PM Modi to express his dissent on the appointment of Rishi Kumar Shukla as CBI director, alleging that the officer did not have experience in handling anti-corruption cases and the criterion for selection was diluted in violation of law and SC judgments. In a blog, Jaitley said Kharge, the leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha, ""dissented once again"" in the appointment of the new CBI director. ""Kharge dissents regularly,"" the minister said. The Congress leader responded in a letter to Jaitley that his objections to the appointment were due to procedures being flouted, and not to question the integrity of the officer appointed as CBI chief.

The agencies are probing if the investments made by Dhoot was a quid pro quo for availing the line of credit from ICICI Bank.The Videocon group had secured Rs 40,000 crore loan from a consortium of banks, led by the SBI, including the Rs 3,250 crore line of credit from ICICI Bank.

By treating it as termination, the bank has revoked a","NEW DELHI: In what is the strongest indictment of its former MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar yet, ICICI Bank on Wednesday said her resignation nearly four months back will now be considered a termination. This, after the Justice Srikrishna Committee indicted her for violating the bank's code of conduct on the Rs 3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group — the group is alleged to have invested Rs 64 crore in a company run by her husband Deepak as a quid pro quo. That's not all, Kochhar stands to lose much of what she earned during her 9-year-stint as the bank's top honcho. ""I am utterly disappointed, hurt and shocked,"" she reacted.Money back guarantee: By treating it as termination, the bank has revoked all her existing and future entitlements such as any unpaid amount, unpaid bonuses or increments, unvested and vested and unexercised stock options and medical benefits. The board's decision will also require a ""clawback"" of all bonuses paid from April, 2009 until March, 2018 — amounting to nearly Rs 10 crore.  67680602 For the last three fiscal years, from 2015-16 to 2017-18, Kochhar was vested with more than 15 lakh shares annually. These ESOPS do not include the special grant of stock options approved by RBI in 2015-16, amounting to 21 lakh shares. 67769012 Deliberate act: The probe report notes that ""her lack of diligence with respect to annual disclosures as required by the bank in terms of its internal policies, the ICICI Bank Code of Conduct and applicable Indian laws, rules and regulations on her interests (direct or indirect) towards avoidance of conflict of interest, when considered that the Bank's processes were dependent solely on the directors discharging their fiduciary duty to recuse themselves and avoid conflict, implies that the Bank's processes were rendered ineffective by her approach to such disclosures and avoidance of conflict.""  67681083 In simple terms, Kochhar either wilfully glossed over the issuance of the loan, which was a quid pro quo for Videocon's investment in her husband's firm, or was wilfully involved. 67769047 What now: This clears the decks for government's investigating agencies — CBI, ED, IT, SFIO — and overarching regulatory bodies — RBI, Sebi and ministry of corporate affairs — to take appropriate action against all the accused in the case.

It asked her to repay over Rs 10 crore of bonus since April 2009, and said it would revoke her stock options, the current market value of which is around Rs 346 crore (the loss to her would be the difference between the market value and the price at which the options were allotted).The move follows a report by former Supreme Court judge, B N Srikrishna, which found Kochhar guilty of violating the bank’s code of conduct in disbursing loans to Videocon group. Kochhar had gone on “leave” on June 18 last year pending completion of the enquiry, but on October 4, put in her papers, perhaps sensing which way the wind was blowing.In a statement issued here, ICICI Bank said the inquiry report concluded that Kochhar was “in violation of the bank’s code of conduct, its framework for dealing with conflict of interest and fiduciary duties, and in terms of applicable Indian laws, rules and regulations”. This was because of her failure to effectively deal with conflict of interest and due disclosure or recusal requirements. The report, which has not been made public, comes on the heels of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filing a first information report against Venugopal Dhoot, Videocon Industries, and Chanda and Deepak Kochhar on charges that loans were disbursed in return for favours.According to sources, the report did not indict the bank’s board, which had appointed Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas to examine allegations first made by whistleblower Arvind Gupta in 2106. Gupta, in a letter to all authorities -- including the finance ministry and Reserve Bank of India -- had alleged that there was an “illicit banking and commercial relationship between Videocon Group of Venugopal Dhoot and ICICI Bank’s MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar’s family-owned NuPower Renewable Group steered by her husband Deepak Kochhar for amassing wrongful personal gains”. While the law firm cleared Kochhar in 2016, it subsequently withdrew its report in October 2018 after being informed by the bank of the fresh allegations against its CEO. Kochhar went on leave on June 18, 2018 and resigned on October 4. Kochhar had received bonuses of over Rs 10 crore since April 2009 – the start of the financial year in which she took charge as chief executive. While the board will have to initiate proceedings to recover the bonuses, the options allotted to her under the employee stock option plan can be revoked as these are within the control of the bank. Kochhar has received close to 94 lakh options over 10 years. These options entitle the holder to buy shares at a fixed price. Employees typically exercise their rights to purchase when there is a substantial appreciation in the value of the shares. Legal experts said the action by the bank would not have any impact on the criminal proceedings undertaken by the CBI.

He said that while the government may argue that the Constitution does not bar it from presenting a full budget, convention in this case is important. Article 116 — which provides for presenting an interim budget — exists in the Constitution for this purpose only, Sinha said.Commenting on the state of the economy, he also said he “does not trust the figures given out by the government any more”. Sinha cited concerns with the back series of GDP data. “The government constituted a committee headed by Sudipto Mundle, but when the report presented some UPA years in better light, it was quickly withdrawn. Then Niti Ayog came out with a new report to show that this government’s growth numbers were better than both NDA I and UPA,” Sinha said. Alleging that statistics were “tweaked” everytime to suit the government, Sinha also said this was done to show demonetisation had a positive impact on agriculture, and then again to show a surge in employment numbers. “It is for the first time in the history of independent India that a government is tampering with statistical data,” Sinha said.In a sharp critique of Union minister Arun Jaitley for his comments to CBI over their FIR against former ICICI bank chief Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon chief Venugopal Dhoot, Sinha said it was “entirely improper” of Jaitley to blog and tell the CBI it was indulging in “investigative adventurism”. “If he had any issues with the CBI he should have raised the issue in private or with the PM. This sets a bad precedent, especially because the finance ministry was under his charge,” Sinha said.

ICICI Bank executive director Anup Bagchi said that two major segments of retail loans - consumer loan and mortgages - are set to grow at a rapid pace in the state this financial year.  The target of Rs 4,900 crore ""will mark a 23 per cent growth year-on-year"", Bagchi told reporters here.  Bagchi said that retail consumer loans have witnessed significant growth in Uttar Pradesh over the last few years. ""We are focusing on consumer loans and home loans to grow in the state,"" he said.  He clarified that cities like Noida and Ghaziabad are not included in the target as these places come under the bank's NCR region.  ""The bank aims to achieve this growth by expanding mortgage loan disbursement by 20 per cent to nearly Rs 2,500 crore in FY20, compared to FY19,"" he said.  Besides, he said, the bank will grow consumer loans disbursement, which comprises largely of personal, car and two-wheeler and commercial vehicle loans, by 30 per cent to nearly Rs 1,700 crore. To make the home loan disbursal process quick and convenient to customers, ICICI Bank has ramped up its credit processing units from three to 13 centres in cities like Moradabad, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Prayagraj, Mathura and Saharanpur.  ICICI Bank is laying emphasis on cities like Lukcnow, Kanpur, Agra, Mathura and Aligarh and expanding its home loan proposition to tier II and III cities that have a robust housing potential like Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Bareilly, he said.  The bank has over 260 branches and nearly 1,250 ATMs in the state at present besides 260 self-service kiosks across branches.  Bagchi said the bank was giving stress on introducing innovative digital solutions for entrepreneurs and MSME industries.  ICICI group imparts free vocational training to underprivileged youth in the state through ICICI Academy for Skills, he said.  The Academy has two centres in UP - at Lucknow and Gorkahpur - and has imparted vocational training to over 3,500 underprivileged youths in the state, he said, adding that by FY'20 it would train nearly 4,600 youth with skills for leading a sustainable livelihood.

The loans to Dhoot’s companies were sanctioned between June 2009 and October 2011.The CBI booked Kochhar, her husband and Dhoot for criminal conspiracy (to cause loss to ICICI Bank), cheating and corruption, charges serious enough for a jail term of seven years if convicted. The allegations had led to Kochhar’s exit from India's second-largest private sector bank last year.The agency said loans were illegally given by Kochhar to the Videocon group in lieu of financial favours and in violation of the Banking Regulation Act, RBI guidelinesand the bank’s credit policy. The Kochhars received illegal payments, including a Rs 64 crore transfer from Dhoot, for the favour, the CBI claimed.The FIR and impending prosecution marks a dramatic fall for Kochhar, once the toast of elite circles, where she was seen as a success story and a social ‘A lister’ who commanded the attention of policy makers in Delhi.The CBI FIR could have serious ramifications for several top bankers and financial experts, as it says their roles may have to be probed.

But the banking,"NEW DELHI: The NPA graph of banks seems to be plateauing after several quarters, but the number of top bankers under the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI’s) lens is on the rise. At last count, there were at least a dozen former public sector bank chiefs and their executive directors who were facing charges of irregularities. On Thursday, the CBI added former ICICI Bank chief Chanda Kochhar to the list by naming her in an FIR, accusing the high-profile banker — along with her husband Deepak Kochhar and industrialist Venugopal Dhoot — of cheating, corruption and criminal conspiracy. 67684956   But what came as a bigger surprise for the banking community, and even officials in key economic ministries, was the agency’s decision to name eight members of ICICI Bank’s committees that cleared loans to Videocon and its group companies, which have now turned into non-performing assets (NPAs). The CBI chose to name them in the FIR for possible probe, although the document was silent on any instance of irregularities committed by them, bankers pointed out.  67680602 The list of those who “may also be investigated” reads like a virtual who’s who of Indian banking, including K V Kamath, who was appointed by the government to lead the New Development Bank, set up by BRICS countries.The list also includes current ICICI Bank MD & CEO Sandeep Bakhshi, Standard Chartered Bank India’s CEO Zarin Daruwala and Goldman Sachs India head Sonjoy Chatterjee. While some of those named by the CBI were with ICICI Bank for the entire period in question, a few like Chatterjee and Bakhshi had left in April and July 2010, respectively. Homi Khusrokhan, a former Tata group top boss, was also on the list. He was an independent director at ICICI Bank.Only recently, the CBI had dropped investigation against three independent directors of IDBI Bank in the Aircel-Maxis case. Many have argued that independent directors only have a limited role in sanctioning loans and base their decision on the proposal that is put forward at the board meeting. In any case, bankers are upset with CBI’s recent moves to name several members of the boards or committees in their cases.The overzealousness of the Pune police’s economic offences wing in arresting Bank of Maharashtra CMD Ravindra Marathe and his deputy Rajendra Gupta has already cause major embarrassment to the state government as the allegations were unsubstantiated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bankers-unhappy-over-move-to-name-panel-members-in-probe/articleshow/67681083.cms

When asked one of them told PTI that he is an employee but has not been paid for the past four months.Another man said he works in the pantry and claimed to know nothing about the raids.Yet another person, found seated at the reception in the C-Wing office along with a few others, said the raid is on across the Mumbai and Aurangabad offices of the group.

With Kochhar still at the helm of affairs at the private sector bank, ICICI claimed that it reposes “full faith” in her and there is no question or scope of any favoritism, nepotism or quid pro quo in the lender’s loans to Videocon Industries.However, when CBI further collected documents from the ICICI Bank and questioned several bank executives, it found the allegations to be true.CBI also examined a close aide of Venugopal Dhoot – Mahesh Chandra Punglia, Kochhar’s brother in law Rajiv Kochhar to establish the charges related to transfer of Videocon companies to Deepak Kochhar and alleged Rs 64 crore bribe.CBI sources said that Dhoot transferring his shares in two companies NuPower Renewables and Supreme Energy in favour of Deepak Kochhar eight months before Rs 300 crore loan was reimbursed and six high value loans approved within a short period of Chanda Kochhar taking over ICICI Bank shows that “there was a pre-planned conspiracy to benefit each other”.Agency says it has documentary evidence to show the transfers and minutes of meeting of loan sanctioning committees, which prove that all the rules were violated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-probe-into-videocon-loan-case-began-much-before-pnb-scam-broke-out/articleshow/67678143.cms

However, the report was withdrawn last year amid a furore over the alleged irregularities in loan given to Videocon Group.Kochhar resigned as CEO of ICICI Bank in October 2018.Further, the AIBOC spokesperson raised questions over the RBI's differential treatment given to ICICI Bank regarding the loan matter, saying the central bank decided to wait for an independent report before taking any action but that was not the case when it came to scams at PNB and Bank of Maharashtra.Unlike their public sector counterparts, private sector banks do not come under the purview of the Central Vigilance Commission, the spokesperson added.The All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC) claims to have around 2.5 lakh members.Last year, former RBI governor Urjit Patel said while it has far more control over private sector banks, it has little say over public sector banks which look up to the finance ministry.The weak legal framework over PSBs deters the central bank from exercising better control over them, he had said.Patel's remarks had came close on the heels of government indicating that regulators were not accountable to anyone.""We must always remember that regulators have a very important function. They ultimately decide the rules of the game and they have to have a third eye kept perpetually open and turned towards the sector. But unfortunately, in (the) Indian system, we politicians are accountable, the regulators are not,"" Union minister Arun Jaitley had said.The CBI has booked former ICICI bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kocchar and Videocon group MD Venugopal Dhoot for alleged cheating and corruption in sanctioning loans to the company, which caused a loss of Rs 1,730 crore to the bank, officials said Thursday.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/psu-bankers-raise-questions-about-delay-in-rbi-action-against-former-icici-bank-chief-chanda-kochhar/articleshow/67676788.cms

The rating action comes amid the challenges the bank faces in its operating environment, Fitch Ratings said in a statement.  ""Fitch Ratings has downgraded ICICI Bank Limited's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB+' from 'BBB-' and its Viability Rating to 'bb+' from 'bbb-'. The Outlook on the IDR is Stable,"" it said.  It has also affirmed ICICI's Support Rating at '3' and Support Rating Floor at 'BB+', it said.  BB rating indicates speculative grade while BBB points at good credit quality.  Fitch lowered its midpoint for India's operating environment to 'bb+' from 'bbb-' following a review of the banking sector's performance, particularly in the last three years, and its regulatory framework, as well as the outlook in the near term.  ""We also compared India with other sovereign jurisdictions in Asia rated in the 'BBB' category including the key metrics of GDP per capita and the ease-of-doing-business ranking,"" it said.  It concluded the sector will perform below the average of its peers over the next one to two years in spite of our expectations of high economic growth and improving business prospects in India.  The performance of Indian banks should have largely bottomed out, but the sector is still struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalisation, it said.  ""We estimate that Indian banks' impaired-loan ratio declined to an average of 10.8 per cent by 9 months of 2019-20 from 11.5 per cent in the financial year ended March 2018 (FY18), which continues to be high by global standards,"" it said.  Capital buffers are assessed by Fitch as moderate, including for private-sector banks, especially in light of their high impaired-loan ratio, risk appetite and the challenging but competitive operating environment, it said.  Fitch further said ICICI Bank's core capitalisation is higher than that of most other Indian banks but within the current operating environment poses only a moderate buffer against risks.  That said, Fitch believes the bank has some capital fungibility through the sale of stakes in profitable subsidiaries and the repatriation of excess capital from foreign subsidiaries.  Its impaired-loan ratio is weaker than that of other large private banks and most banks with Viability Ratings in the 'bb' category, even though the measure has improved slightly to 7.5 per cent in 2019-20 from 10 per cent in the previous fiscal, it added.

The expansion will be done by adopting ","MUMBAI: ICICI Bank plans to ramp up home loans in a big way, increasing the portfolio from Rs 1.5 lakh crore (as of Q1FY19) to Rs 2 lakh crore next fiscal. The bank plans to add 500 more cities to the existing network of 1,000 centres where home loans are available. The expansion will be done by adopting the branch-within-a-branch model and adding 560 new central processing centres for home loans.The plans for home loans are the first business strategy enunciated by the lender after Sandeep Bakhshi took charge as chief operating officer. “There are no demand constraints when it comes to home loans. What we need to do is to speed up the process to increase the flow and manage operating expenses,” said Anup Bagchi, executive director and head of retail. As part of speeding up the loan process, the bank has enabled developers to obtain pre-approvals for their projects through a paperless process. “We already have around 30,000 projects that have been approved for home loans,” said Bagchi. 64863303 According to Bagchi, home buyers never had it as good as the present. “Thanks to rising incomes and steady prices, affordability as measured by the ratio of home cost to income is at an all-time high,” said Bagchi. He added that despite an increase in interest rates, home loan borrowers are getting loans at a little over sovereign rates.At Rs 1.5 lakh crore, the mortgage loan book is half of the bank’s overall retail loan portfolio of around Rs 3 lakh crore, Bagchi said. “We are expanding our network to many new locations in tier-2 and -3 towns as well as micro-markets on the periphery of major metros and continue to leverage technology to offer home loans in a fully digitised manner,” he said.The bank will focus on lending to middle-class customers. For affordable housing loans, the bank will use its subsidiary ICICI Home Finance. The bank had earlier looked at selling the home finance arm, but changed tracks and decided to reposition the company as an affordable housing finance provider. The new strategy is to develop skills for lending based on income assessment and take advantage of the fiscal incentives provided to borrowers, developers and lenders.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-bank-plans-to-boost-home-loan-biz/articleshow/64862137.cms

Syndicate Bank is now extending its usage by creating a private blockchain for ATM reconciliation.Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions occurring between different blocks - and Syndicate Bank is now keeping ATM machines as one of the blocks to help verify transactions and alert the customer in nano-seconds. ""Say you are a Syndicate Bank customer taking money out of say a Syndicate Bank or ICICI Bank ATM. If say you tried to withdraw Rs 10,000 and you get a message saying your account has been debited, but cash has not been dispensed - what do you do?"" asks Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, MD, Syndicate Bank.The normal procedure is to call the customer's bank, report the incident. And then wait for 4-5 working days, as the bank checks its systems to verify if the transaction has occurred or not and then reverse the amount. ""Meanwhile it's five days of tension for you. But in a blockchain model that need not be the case,"" says Mahapatra. When the ATM becomes a block in a series of transactions, the system would immediately check the opening balance for the day, run through all the transactions that took place since then, and if there is more money in the ATM than what the digital transactions noted, that means it's obvious your money has not been dispensed. ""So our system will immediately alert you - 'Your attempt to withdraw Rs 10,000 has failed as cash was not dispensed. The amount will be reversed back to the account within 2 working days'."" says Mahapatra. Syndicate Bank believes that blockchain, apart from reducing reconciliation time from five to two working days, will also ensure the customer's piece of mind -- with such instant notification.Another issue when it comes to PSUs has been the large number of corporate loan defaults. In the jewellery sector alone, from the Nirav Modi scam to Kanishk Gold, banks came in for a lot of flak for improper audits and failure to spot irregularities. To avert that, Syndicate Bank has come up with a technology called Sales Saathi.Sales Saathi geo-tags employees' tablets and helps check if they did visit the factories, showrooms and offices of borrowers. ""After the on-spot inspections, bank employees can also add notes based on their observations. This when fed into our systems can help as early warning signals for a possible loan default,"" said Mahapatra.The technology would also help senior management keep tabs on activities. ""Some of our general managers have to manage as many as 45 branches. After 40 visits to 40 branches in three months, the GM himself would be hard pressed to remember every single interaction and recommendation of his. Sales Saathi helps to manage this,"" says Mahapatra.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/syndicate-bank-to-use-blockchain-for-atm-reconciliation/articleshow/67575911.cms

It ranges from Rs 5,000 to Rs 20,000. “Once the credit limit is set up for a customer, a consolidated bill is generated on the first day of the subsequent month, which has to be paid by the 15th day of the same month.

Banks now account for it,India Business News: BENGALURU: Banks are trying to make your dreams come true.,"BENGALURU: Banks are trying to make your dreams come true. Many have over the past year created new kinds of accounts that help you see the floating islands of lake Titicaca, or have a destination wedding at Jagmandir Island Palace, or get your LKG toddler into a good school. It’s a strategy that insurance companies and mutual funds have employed before.36-year-old Mumbaiite Aisha Khan’s Rs 2 lakh trip to Saudi Arabia to visit Mecca and Medina was courtesy her ICICI Bank’s iWish account. A part savings and part loan product, the iWish account lets you set goals for anything you desire. And since ICICI Bank has partnered with players like Thomas Cook, bank customers get the precise cost of their dream. ""And if you were planning a surprise birthday party for your grandparent, not only can you contribute, you can also share on Facebook and get all the other party invitees – friends and family – to contribute towards this iWish goal,"" says Madhivanan Balakrishnan, chief digital officer at ICICI Bank. There’s no month-on-month pressure like in a recurring deposit – you can choose how much you want to set aside. ""Even though it’s a fun product, we still find that overwhelmingly people still use it for necessities like their kids' education (22%) or child's insurance-cum-savings plan (11%). About 9% use it for big-bash weddings and birthdays and another 9% for their first bike or car,"" says Balakrishnan. Axis Bank’s ASAP Goals account too was designed keeping in mind the diversity of millennial needs, be it short-term goals like bikes or making the first down-payment towards a home, says the bank’s head of digital banking and customer experience Praveen Bhatt.On the bank’s mobile app, you need to create a specific goal. Automatically, the app will set a monthly savings target to achieve the goal. Any deposit above Rs 10,000 in the ASAP savings account is automatically invested in a one-year fixed deposit that yields a higher rate of interest. The customer even has the flexibility to edit and set new goals, and the app will automatically recalibrate the target savings.HDFC Bank’s Dream Deposit gives you the flexibility to set aside a portion of your salary to reach your goals with interest rates on par with the bank’s FDs and RDs, and without any of the charges that come with breaking an FD deposit or missing a monthly instalment in an RD.The advantage is that for much smaller sums of investment, as small as Rs 1,000, you get rates equal to a regular FD, and an option to deposit a much larger amount if you get a windfall, to reach one's dream faster. Kotak Mahindra Bank will soon offer a Holiday RD for those bitten by wanderlust. Customers can deposit a fixed monthly instalment for 12 months. On maturity, the customer will receive a top-up from the travel partner such that the interest earned and the top-up is equal to one additional instalment.

","BENGALURU: Uploading photos of his stay in a fancy resort on Facebook proved to be a thief’s undoing, landing him in police net. Anand, a 23-year-old from Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh, had stolen a debit card from the doctor he was employed with and withdrawn Rs 20,000 from the account. Investigation revealed that he had also stolen 480gm of gold worth Rs 11 lakh from another employer in the past. Anand had been working as a driver in the doctor’s Koramangala household for a year. He had gained the trust of the family members, who had no inkling that all he wanted was to make a quick buck. Trusting him blindly, the doctor often gave him his debit card and shared the PIN to withdraw money for him. In December 2018, Anand stole the debit card and withdrew the cash. The doctor searched for the card but didn’t suspect the driver.To celebrate the New Year, Anand took three days of leave and went to Ooty, and uploaded a few photos of his stay in a resort. Though the doctor was Anand’s Facebook friend, he didn’t give much thought to the former’s post. However, his family members raised suspicion, wondering how Anand could afford the stay and saying that they often found money to be missing from the house. This caused the doctor to file a complaint with Koramangala police.On verifying the doctor’s bank transactions, police got to know that the cash had been withdrawn from an ICICI Bank ATM in Koramangala. Cops checked the CCTV footage, which confirmed that Anand was the culprit. After the trip, an unsuspecting Anand reported back to work as usual but was immediately arrested. He confessed to the crime. Further probe revealed that Anand had even stolen gold from another employer and was building a house in his hometown. “We suspect he operated alone and may have been involved in other theft cases too. We have handed him over to judicial custody,” said a police officer.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/fb-post-leads-to-arrest-of-driver-who-stole-doctors-debit-card/articleshow/67506598.cms

While the Union Bank of India exited last year from Belgium, the ICICI Bank has recently decided to close its Antwerp branch giving a big jolt to industry players. The US-based Rapaport group has stated that the move followed a strategic review of the ICICI’s business operations in the country, a spokesperson for the company confirmed. The bank has asked its customers to close their accounts by February 28, according to a December 28 notice to its clients.The Union Bank of India also announced it was leaving the Antwerp market last year, citing the disappointing performance of its diamond business. Belgium’s KBC closed its Antwerp Diamond Bank in 2014, while London-based Standard Chartered stopped extending credit to the midstream in 2016.The small diamantaires and rough traders from Surat and Mumbai purchase rough diamonds from big companies having bank credit facilities in Antwerp. Now with the Indian banks exiting the diamond sector in Antwerp, the small diamantaires are left with no choice. Regional chairman, gems and jewellery export promotion council (GJEPC), Dinesh Navadia, told TOI: “Small unit owners and merchants used to purchase rough diamonds from big rough diamond dealers in Belgium having credit facilities with the Indian and Antwerp banks. With the exit of the banks from Antwerp, which is the world’s largest diamond trading hub, the diamantaires are left with no choice but to reduce their production.” Himmat Bhadiadara, a rough diamond merchant in Mahidhapura, said, “We are dependent on the big dealers having bank credit facilities. If the banks are exiting Antwerp, it will be difficult for us to purchase rough diamonds. To run our factories, we will have to take money on hefty interest rate from the market.” The total exposure by the Indian banks to the diamond trade is between $6 billion and $7 billion. The interest charged is around 13%.Being the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre, India’s annual rough diamond imports is pegged at $ 18 billion. However, the Belgian banking institution accounted for about 11% to 12% of the global diamond finance market. Traders use loans to buy rough, or uncut diamonds in auctions from mines in resource-rich areas like Africa. “Without bank financing, the diamond business cannot survive for longer period. Antwerp is the hub of rough diamond trading, as more than 70% of the diamonds flow from here to India. Small traders will have tough days ahead,” said diamond industry analyst Aniruddha Lidbide.

This could imply a larger role for newly-appointed chief operating officer Sandeep Bakhshi who will be around for over four years after CEO’s Chanda Kochhar term ends on March 2019. “Without second-guessing the ICICI Bank board, we wonder under what circumstances the three-tier structure at the bank might be collapsed to two, as a COO role strikes us as unnecessary in the long term,” said Jefferies in a report on ICICI Bank. The report terms the present structure as a `safe middle-ground’ but did not attempt to second guess the board on its succession plans.According to Jefferies, the transition from Kochhar to Bakshi should be smooth considering that Bakshi has been associated with the ICICI bank group for 32 years, working across its diverse verticals (both corporate & retail) and other subsidiaries. In his previous roles, he served as the MD & CEO of both the life and general insurance arms.On Monday, the ICICI Bank board appointed Bakhshi head of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance as chief operating officer of the bank.

This is the time when they go full throttle on lending and beef up their top line before closing their books for the year. The year 2019 will, however, see a lot of front-ending of events in the private sector and also among state-owned lenders as the government is likely to push through some key decisions ahead of the elections.On the cards is a decision on transfer of surplus funds by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the government. This is likely to follow the report of the Bimal Jalan-led committee, which is expected before end-March 2019. The government is simultaneously going full-steam ahead on its decision to consolidate the three public sector banks — Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. Management consultancy firm EY has already been appointed to help in the process.The other major M&A activity in the public sector that will conclude in the first quarter of 2019 will be LIC’s acquisition of IDBI Bank. LIC has said that it will pay shareholders who respond to its open offer for purchase of IDBI Bank stock on December 31. This means that the process will be completed in the third quarter. LIC’s acquisition, through infusion of fresh capital, will bring IDBI Bank out of RBI’s prompt corrective action plan. LIC plans to professionalise IDBI Bank on the lines of Axis Bank. Additionally, the fourth quarter is when SBI’s mega qualified institutional placement of equity shares is expected. SBI aims to raise Rs 20,000 crore as it prepares itself for a surge in lending in 2019.Early 2019 will also see the conclusion of the last chapter in the high drama in several private banks. Justice B N Srikrishna, who is looking into the conflict of interest allegations at ICICI Bank, is expected to submit his report in the coming weeks. This will put an end to the controversy in the bank, which culminated in the resignation of Chanda Kochhar. In Kotak Bank, the Bombay high court will decide on the lender’s plea to retain its promoter’s shareholding at above 20%. Kotak Bank has filed a writ petition challenging the central bank’s order to dilute promoter holding to 20%. The new year will be the most eventful for Yes Bank where the lender’s founder, promoter and CEO Rana Kapoor is expected to step down in January 2019 and make way for a new chief executive. The year is also likely to see a truce between the two promoter group’s Rana Kapoor and his sister-in-law Madhu Kapur who have been fighting in courts over the right to appoint directors. Axis Bank will also see a new beginning with newly-appointed CEO Amitabh Chaudhury taking charge from January 1 in place of Shikha Sharma who completes her term in December.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/big-banking-decisions-to-precede-polls/articleshow/67329754.cms

Similarly, they have committed to provide funds for 17 out of the 20 projects where the process of financial closure is underway.“There is a huge jump in private sector banks and FIs funding projects this year as compared to last year and it’s highest ever in NHAI’s history. Banks face no risk in these projects implemented on Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM). One of the reasons behind the interest of private banks in the sector is RBI imposing prompt corrective action (PCA) on 11 banks. Public sector banks have also been facing the problem of excess credit exposure,” an NHAI official said.In 2018-19, the NHAI had bid out 109 projects under Public Private partnership (PPP) mode and HAM is the mode of implementation for almost all these projects. Unlike conventional Build Operate Transfer (BOT) mode where the private player is also tasked with toll collection for certain years to recover the investment and clear bank dues, in case of HAM, toll collection is NHAI’s responsibility and hence there is hardly any risk.“The only risk is during the construction phase. To ensure that the project does not get stuck, we preferred to get land and all clearances before giving the letter of appointment to start work. Unlike in BOT-Toll where construction companies and banks had faced problems after the work started, we have taken steps to avoid such a situation,” said an official at NHAI.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pvt-banks-ahead-in-highway-funding/articleshow/67238384.cms

According to ICICI Bank, the unexpected drop in international crude prices is likely to compel the RBI to change its stance from calibrated tightening to neutral.“In India, we have been targeting inflation of 4% and the repo rate has accordingly been kept at two and half percentage points above this. But actual inflation has been much lower, resulting in high real rates,” said B Prasanna, head of markets at ICICI Bank. Real rates are the nominal rates adjusted for inflation, but they can be determined only for the past since inflation can be observed only in hindsight.“Earlier, when the policy was targeting wholesale prices, there have been instances when real rates were negative despite repo rate being at 9% because of high inflation,” said Prasanna. He added that the present high real rates improve the attractiveness of Indian bonds.Going forward, however, inflation is expected to firm up. ICICI Bank has forecast consumer price index (CPI) to average around 4% for the first half of FY20, but then pick up sharply in the second half. The key risks are a possible reversal in food prices and the government slipping on its fiscal deficit target.The stress in the farm sector due to low food prices is expected to keep consumption demand in check. This will keep economic growth contained at 7.4% in FY20, which will be marginally better than the 7.2% forecast for FY19. This would be because the economy would have finished its transition to the goods & services tax (GST) regime, resulting in higher formalisation.The biggest positive news this year, however, is the sharp fall in crude oil prices, which will result in balance of payments swinging to the positive. This, coupled with the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve pausing rate hikes, has turned out to be positive for the rupee, which has staged a smart recovery in recent weeks. “Performance of emerging market currencies against the dollar will be mixed and less vulnerable economies, with stable political set-up and current account surpluses, would be preferred. The fall in oil prices would also benefit high-yield current account deficit countries such as India and Indonesia,” said Prasanna.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/real-rates-in-india-among-highest-icici/articleshow/67200798.cms

Veteran banker and former Bank of Baroda chairman and managing director MD Mallya is the frontrunner to succeed Sharma, two people aware of the development said. Mallya was appointed to the ICICI Bank board on May 29.“The ICICI Bank board was of the opinion that the bank needs a qualified former banker for the position in this time of crisis. Nothing is final yet, but looks like Mallya is the favourite,” one of the people said.Sources also told ET that while a few board members want current chairman MK Sharma, 70, to continue for some time, he has expressed his unwillingness. But if the board is unable to find a successor soon, Sharma may have to continue as chairman, sources in the know said. He was appointed as non-executive chairman of the bank on July 1, 2015, for a period of three years. 64442465 The maximum age of appointment of non-executive directors has been capped at 75 years.

The sources cited above said that the board of ICICI Bank approached several reputed industrialists and retired bankers, but they largely declined to join the board because of controversy surrounding the bank’s CEO, Chanda Kochhar.

The new rates are effective from today.  India's largest lender SBI has increased the lending rate by 10 basis points across all tenors up to three years.  Now SBI's overnight and one-month tenors' Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) stands at 7.9 per cent as against 7.8 per cent, as per the SBI's website.  The MCLR for a three-year tenor increased to 8.45 per cent from 8.35 per cent earlier.  The state-owned Punjab National (PNB), the country's second largest lender, raised the MCLR for three-year and five-year tenors to 8.55 per cent and 8.7 per cent, respectively.  Country's second largest private bank ICICI Bank too said it has raised five-year tenor MCLR by 10 bps to 8.70 per cent. It has also raised the MCLR by 10 bps in loans with tenor of one year and three years.  However, lending rate remains unchanged in case of loans up to three months.  PNB has also increased the base rate to 9.25 per cent from the earlier 9.15 per cent.  Private sector bank ICICI Bank too has raised one-year MCLR by 10 bps to 8.40 per cent from today.  Other banks, sources said, were also likely to follow suit.  Most of home and auto loans are linked to MCLR.  Meanwhile, mortage lender HDFC said that it has increased its retail prime lending rate (RPLR), on which its adjustable rate home loans (ARHL) are benchmarked, by 10 basis points, effective tomorrow.  Karnataka Bank has raised its interest rates on deposits.  Interest on domestic and NRE rupee term deposits for a period of one year to two years stands revised to 7.25 per cent from 7.10 (for deposits up to Rs 10 crore) representing a hike of 15 basis points, it said in a regulatory filing.

In a regulatory filing, ICICI Bank also said that it has not appointed any search committee to find a successor of Kochhar. According to media reports, Kocchar was asked to go on leave pending an independent enquiry into her role in granting huge loan to Videocon group on quid pro quo basis. ""The ICICI Bank Board denies having asked Ms Chanda Kochhar to go on leave. She is on her annual leave which was planned in advance. Further, the Board denies that it has appointed any search committee to find her successor,"" a bank said. Earlier this week, the bank board had decided to launch an enquiry to be headed by an ""independent and credible person"", to examine and enquire into an anonymous whistle blower complaint alleging that the bank MD & CEO had not adhered to code of conduct and acted in ""conflict of interest"" over a period of time. ""In keeping with the Whistle Blower Policy of the bank, board has mandated its audit committee to take all further actions in the matter to operationalise this decision -- including in particular, appointment of an independent and credible person as head of the enquiry, determining the terms of reference..."" the bank had said in a regulatory filing dated May 30. It is learnt that Kochhar has not been attending office from this week and is expected to join only after June 10. The enquiry was ordered by the board, at its meeting on May 29, on a complaint by an anonymous whistle-blower against Kochhar. There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis. It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar. Market regulator Sebi has served a notice on Kochhar on dealings of the bank with Videocon Group and Nupower. Besides, there are allegations that NuPower got investments of Rs 325 crore from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia. The investments from Ruia's son-in-law's firm into NuPower started in December 2010. Incidentally, the same month ICICI Bank was lead banker in a consortium of Indian banks that extended a USD 530 million loan to Essar Steel Minnesota LLC on December 29, 2010. This loan was later classified as NPA. The Reserve Bank in its 2016 investigation in the matter had raised questions over the ownership of the Mauritius-based entity, First Land Holding, which had invested Rs 325 crore in NuPower. Also, there was no clarity over the alleged Rs 64-crore loan (unsecured fully convertible debentures) given to NuPower by Supreme Energy, which was 99.99 per cent owned by Videocon chief Venugopal Dhoot at that time. While Chanda Kochhar sat on the credit committee that approved the loan to Videocon, there are allegations of conflict of interest in her husband's brother, Singapore-based Rajiv Kochhar, performing debt-restructuring work on errant corporate borrowers from ICICI, including Videocon. The stock of the bank today closed 1.37 per cent higher at Rs 289.50 on BSE.

It allows sharing of information with third-party applications with the help of QR codes, barcodes or near field communication.

Most of the bank’s deposits are in the above one-year category. Given that the benchmark rate for loans is determined by cost of funds, there is a strong likelihood that the bank will increase its marginal cost of lending rate in coming months.The increase in deposit rates comes at a time when the money markets are seeing a deficit of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore. This is reflected in the short-term borrowings by banks. Liquidity has turned tight on account of two factors — credit demand from corporates has grown year on year 15.6% in the second week of November. Also, there has been an increase in currency in circulation due to withdrawals during the Diwali week last month and this is yet to return to the banks.Earlier this month, HDFC Bank hiked deposit rates by up to 0.5%, while another private lender ICICI Bank raised rates by up to 0.25% on some maturities.For deposits of two to three years, the rate has been increased to 6.80% from 6.75%.

The regulator during an investigation found that a ""binding implementation agreement"" was signed between ICICI Bank and Bank of Rajasthan on May 18, 2010 in order to procure cooperation and support of dominant shareholders of Bank of Rajasthan to effect the proposal of its amalgamation with the private lender.  The probe revealed that ICICI Bank failed to disclose the information regarding signing of the binding agreement to the stock exchanges in a timely manner.  It was noted that the agreement was signed between the banks on May 18, 2010 at approximately 04:30 am but ICICI Bank made the disclosure to the exchanges at 08:10 pm, despite the fact that the agreement was entered into before opening of the stock markets.  Therefore, the lender delayed the disclosure by one trading day, Sebi said in an order.  The binding agreement was a proper formalised legal agreement and a crucial step to effect the amalgamation of Bank of Rajasthan with ICICI Bank. It also contained clauses regarding the swap ratio of shares and the draft scheme of amalgamation among other information, Sebi added.  Further, Sebi said that ""any information related to the amalgamation, mergers or takeovers of a listed company are deemed to be price sensitive information. Therefore, in the instant matter, the signing of the binding agreement is a price sensitive information.""  Such information was supposed to be disclosed to the stock exchanges ""on an immediate basis.""  ""However, by withholding such disclosure for one full trading day, ICICI created a situation of information asymmetry wherein the general public was not aware of any such agreement,"" Sebi said.  By doing so, the lender has violated listing agreement norms as well as provisions of Prohibition of Insider Trading regulations.  Regarding Sandeep Batra, the regulator said that ""being the compliance officer of ICICI Bank and also being aware of the developments regarding the signing of the binding agreement, failed to ensure that ICICI Bank complies with the requirements of making immediate and continuous disclosures regarding binding agreement to the stock exchanges.""  Consequently, a total fine of Rs 10 lakh has been imposed on ICICI Bank while Sandeep Batra has been fined Rs 2 lakh.

It also said the current set of allegations, which comes amid instances of non-performing assets (NPA) in the banking system due to fraudulent lending, pose a reputational risk for the private sector lender. ""An investigation into allegations that India's ICICI Bank extended a loan with a potential conflict of interest raises questions over the bank's governance and creates reputational risks,"" the ratings agency said in a note. Late last month, the bank admitted that Kochhar did not recuse herself from a credit committee meeting which decided to give a Rs 3,250 crore loan to diversified Videocon Group in 2012. According to the media reports, Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar had formed a joint venture with Videocon promoter Venugopal Dhoot for a business dealing in renewable energy and there were a string of transactions later, which gave him the full control of the venture after the exit of Dhoot. The Central Bureau of Investigation has initiated a preliminary enquiry in the matter to check any wrongdoing, while other agencies, including the Enforcement Directorate (ED), are also investigating the case. The bank's board has stood firmly behind Chanda Kochhar, saying no wrong was committed by her, and the committee was headed by the bank's then chief K V Kamath. More details are emerging by the day, generally through news reports, including one today, which said a section of the bank's board is against the idea of Chanda Kochhar continuing in her role. ""The presence of the bank's CEO on this credit committee - and the bank's reluctance to support an independent probe - have, in our opinion, created doubts over the strength of its corporate governance practices,"" the Fitch note said. The ratings agency said the allegations against ICICI Bank are coming against a backdrop of high non-performing assets in the banking sector, some of which have been linked to fraudulent lending. It warned that regulatory sanctions are also possible, depending on the outcome of the investigations by the law enforcement agencies and there is also a risk of financial penalties and legal action. The ongoing investigations will undermine investor confidence in the bank, and have potential implications for funding costs and liquidity in an extreme scenario, it warned, conceding that as a systemically important entity, the state will chip-in with support. If the investigations expose misconduct on part of the bank management, Fitch said a lot of perceptions like private sector lenders being better in corporate governance due to better qualified and compensated leadership and a diversified investor base helping the bank, would come under question. The agency said it will ""closely monitor"" the developments and take ""appropriate rating action"" if risks to the banks' reputation and financial profile were to rise considerably. It also added that at present, the bank is well capitalised with a core buffer of 14.2 per cent and the losses on the loan in question will be unlikely to significantly undermine ICICI's financial profile.

Complainant Omesh Garg, a resident of Sector 38 (West), stated in his complaint that he was having a savings account in ICICI bank's Sector 8 branch. He averred that on being asked by a bank officer the complainant obtained two policies ICICI Pru Elite Life II-UA2, carrying a premium of Rs 2 lakh each. Every year the premium used to be due in October and the mode of payment was ECS.He added that following some financial issues Garg did not want to continue with the ECS option for the said policies and as such sent an e-mail request to the same official of the bank as well as to another official on August 31, 2016, much prior to the due date for disabling the ECS option against the said policies. Despite that, on March 7, 2017, Rs 2 lakh was deducted from the account of the complainant against one of the policies. Thereafter, he took up the matter with the insurance company and the bank, seeking a refund of the amount deducted from his account without prior notice. On being approached, the bank said that the refund could not be made.The insurance company stated in their reply that stated that the premium of Rs 2 lakh was due on October 26, 2016, which was to be debited directly from the account of the complainant, but due to insufficient funds it got dishonoured on October 28, 2016, and was ultimately debited on March 7, 2017.

According to ICICI Bank sources, the law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas told the bank that since the scope of investigation to probe similar allegations by a new committee — headed by retired Supreme Court judge B N Srikrishna — had widened, so its report was no more valid.In its 2016 report, the law firm had given a clean chit to Kochhar. In March this year, the bank’s board had reposed “full faith” in Kochhar and her leadership based on the same report. “The law firm submitted its report in December 2016 stating that it had found no evidence of nepotism and conflict of interest on the part of Kochhar and accordingly the matter was treated as closed,” ICICI Bank said.When contacted, the law firm’s managing partner Cyril Shroff declined to comment on the current status of the firm’s 2016 report, citing the client confidentiality clause. Market players, however, are speculating whether the law firm’s decision means a “complete withdrawal” or the report is not valid for any other reason.Following allegations of nepotism and conflict of interest against Kochhar, and also a letter from a whistleblower earlier this year, the bank in late May set up the Justice Srikrishna Committee to probe the matter. The allegations centred around ICICI Bank’s loan to Videocon Group and a subsequent deal by her husband with the same group and the latter being suspected of a quid pro quo.After the bank informed the law firm about setting up of the new committee, subsequently the law firm said that its earlier report would no longer be valid, ICICI Bank said.Markets regulator Sebi had sent a show-cause notice to the bank and Kochhar about the lack of disclosure, while the CBI started investigating the matter. The investigating agency, however, is yet to file an FIR in the case.Even as the investigations by the bank’s internal committee and other agencies were on, Kochhar resigned from her post on October 4.

He was convinced by the builder and the bank manager to get a loan for the rest of the amount.“The builder asked me to meet a bank representative who explained that the loan amount will be sanctioned and the instalment of Rs 26,000 per month will be paid by the builder till I get possession. They took 7 or 8 cheques and other documents from me and even assured me not to worry because they will take care of everything. The builder even paid the instalments for a few months but later stopped them. The bank then started sending recovery agents to my home. I then enquired the matter from the bank and got to know that the amount has already been transferred to the builder’s account in one go under my name about which I was not even informed,” said Singh.When Singh approached the builder, he was allegedly threatened and abused by the officials who sent him back. “I even paid a few instalments from my own pocket. However, since the amount is very big and the project is also incomplete even after years, I could no longer afford it. After months of depression, I have managed to file an FIR. I just want my money back,” Rahul said.“Apart from Rahul, there are nearly 770 buyers who have invested in the projects by the builder group and have not received possession,” said Sanjay Maheshwari, another buyer.Police said, those booked for fraud are Piyush Tiwari, chairman-cum-managing director, Diwakar Sharma, a former director of the building company, and an unidentified bank manager. The two are already facing cases filed against them by homebuyers for which Diwakar Sharma is already behind bars in Tihar jail while Piyush Tiwari is reportedly absconding.

Nearly two-thirds of the visitors are under 35 years. ""There were issues related to debt-equity ratio and the number of years for which tax returns had to be submitted. The government has now asked us to have fixed norms for a lot of things,"" said a banker.Sources said banks have been told to offer loans to companies with a debt-equity ratio of 4:1, given that MSMEs typically have a lower equity base. Similarly, these borrowers will need a credit ratio or debt-to-income-ratio of 1:1.With two private lenders, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, also showing interest in the new portal, sources indicated that the platform may be opened to those outside the public sector too.Last month, the government had announced funding of up to Rs 1 crore in 59 minutes flat for MSMEs.

Truecaller has gone live with its account-to-account payment service, ahead of WhatsApp, as it is fully compliant with the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) data localisation norms.In terms of the tie-up, those who register for payments under the UPI platform through the Truecaller app will get a @barodapay handle — the address for receiving or sending money from their bank accounts. This partnership by Truecaller is in addition to its tie-up with ICICI Bank. Earlier this year, Truecaller had acquired fintech app Chillr to get a foothold in the payment space.BoB head fintech and new business initiatives Akhil Handa said, “We are getting in people who have been outside of the e- payments system in a frictionless way as many phone users already have Truecaller app installed.” He added that this works as a customer acquisition strategy for the bank as most of those who are joining are non-BoB customers.“Almost 50% of customers coming on board are fresh to digital payments. This is the first time that they are using UPI and they are trying it out,” said Sony Joy, VP, Truecaller Pay India. Joy was the co-founder of Chillr.According to Handa, getting a customer to download a new app and making sure that he has use cases to keep engaging with the app is a tall task. “In the longer run, we feel that the UPI apps by payment service providers will be more successful and that is already being reflected in the market share,” said Handa.

The lenders’ decision was made public by BJP member of Parliament Kirit Somaiya, who said in a statement that banks have informed him that they have asked for Rajan’s passport to be impounded.In the letter, Allahabad Bank said that leader of their consortium, ICICI Bank, had convened a meeting of lenders on September 19 to discuss the complaint. Following this, the banks approached the passport authorities. Allahabad Bank is understood to have written to Somaiya, acknowledging the MP’s complaint along with confidential information pertaining to the company’s group accounts received from a whistleblower.Gammon India owes banks around Rs 7,000 crore. Last month, public sector lender Union Bank of India had approached the bankruptcy court after the company defaulted on a Rs 315-crore loan. Although Gammon India had defaulted in 2015, banks have been trying to get the company back on track under various restructuring schemes. However, time ran out for the company after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did away with all loan-restructuring schemes in February this year. Lenders have faced flak after promoters like Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi fled the country after defaulting on large loans. Since then, Parliament has passed the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, which has been introduced through the ordinance route. The new law provides for attachment of property of any person who is declared a fugitive economic offender (FEO).

The restrictions follow the lender’s failure to bring down the promoter company’s stake to below 40%, as required by RBI’s licensing conditions. This is the first major regulator action by the RBI since the bank was launched in 2015. “The bank is taking necessary steps to comply with the licensing condition to bring down the shareholding of the non-operating holding company in the bank to 40% and shall continue to engage with the RBI in this behalf,” Bandhan Bank said in a statement to the exchange.According to sources, the Bandhan Bank management was taken by surprise as it believed that there would be some flexibility to time its dilution in keeping with market conditions. The RBI embargo is unlikely to affect the lender’s business in the near future. Sources close to Bandhan Bank said that it has 938 branches and 3,006 micro credit offices, which is enough for a new lender to expand business.One possible reason for the delay could be that Bandhan Bank has been exploring the inorganic route to grow. It was in the fray for acquiring PNB Housing Finance and was said to be exploring the share-swap option. Bandhan is understood to have reached out to GIC of Singapore with an objective of forming a consortium.The promoter holding in Bandhan Bank had come down following an extremely successful Rs 4,473-crore IPO in March 2018. Shares of the bank had risen 30% on listing and touched a high of Rs 730 in August 2018, as against the issue price of Rs 375. On Friday, the lender’s stock ended 1% down at Rs 564 by close of trade on the BSE.In the offer document for its IPO, Bandhan Bank had said that licensing guidelines required the holding company to reduce its shareholding in the bank to 40% within three years from the date of commencement of operations. Bandhan Financial Holdings (BFHL) was also required to reduce its shareholding further to 20% and 15% within 10 years and 12 years, respectively. “There can be no assurance that BFHL or our bank will be able to comply with these requirements within the stipulated time period, which may subject BFHL or us to regulatory actions,” the offer document had said.66000711 The RBI action is seen as an increasingly tough stance taken by the regulator on compliance issues against private banks. In March 2018, the central bank imposed the highest ever penalty of nearly Rs 59 crore on ICICI Bank for selling securities from a held-to-maturity portfolio. In April 2018, the central bank raised questions on Axis Bank MD Shikha Sharma’s reappointment, resulting in her deciding to step down early. Last month, the central bank rejected an attempt by Kotak Bank to work around RBI guidelines on promoter shareholding by issuing preference shares and, earlier this month, it said that Yes Bank MD Rana Kapoor could continue only until end-January 2019. It could also be a warning to Kotak Bank to bring down the promoter’s stake, considering that the private lender had sought extensions from the RBI in the past.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bandhan-faces-rbi-ire-over-stake-norm/articleshow/66000712.cms

This is estimated to inject about Rs 2 lakh crore worth of liquidity to buy mostly short-end bonds, which in turn is expected to bring down short-term rates.

From an asset quality perspective, which has weighed heavily on its performance in the past few years, the bank reported an improvement in the gross non-performing assets ratio at 6.37 as against 8.54 in the year-ago period, as the overall slippages declined to Rs 2,482 crore from Rs 3,100 crore.  However, retail loans constituted as much as Rs 1,323 crore of fresh slippages, and there was also an increase in the low-rated book that can cause more pains in the future, at Rs 16,000 crore, up from Rs 15,350 crore a year ago.  The bank has no material exposure to a mortgage major in distress right now, and there will not be any major impact because of its NBFC/HFC book in the future as well, its management said.  Executive director-designate Sandeep Batra attributed the rise in stressed retail loans to an increase in the proportion of the low-ticket loans in the book at 62 per cent, and added that the performance is in line with its expectations which are set during the pricing.  To a question on whether the rise in low grade loans is attributable to the overall slowdown, he said the bank is not immune to the overall economic environment which is not much to write home about.  Corporate loans grew at a slower 7 per cent during the quarter and the bank had to rely on the higher 22 per cent growth in retail loans to achieve 16.4 per cent growth in the domestic book which now stands at Rs 5.53 lakh crore.  The management, however, did not share its outlook on the loan growth and when it sees a revival in corporate loan demand, which according to many observers, can give a leg-up to the stalled growth engine.  Rather than the balance sheet size, the bank is focused on having a risk-calibrated strategy of growth for the last one year and will continue with the same, the management said.  The net interest margins expanded by a notch to 3.64 per cent during the quarter, and the bank is aiming to better it further.  The average share of the current and savings account deposits dipped to 42.2 per cent of the base, and the bank hinted at there being a greater reliance on fixed deposits as part of its liability strategy.  The expansion in NIMs and loan growth pushed up the core net interest income 25.5 per cent to Rs 8,057 crore, while non-interest income grew 20.8 per cent to Rs 3,854 crore.  Total provisions on a standalone basis came down to Rs 2,506.87 crore from Rs 3,994.29 crore thanks to the fall in GNPAs and the overall provision coverage ratio stood at 76.1.  Its telecom industry exposure stands at 1.8 per cent of the book with most of it to the top two players, and it will have to assess the impact of the Supreme Court order on the telcos, the management said.  On the taxation line, its September outgo doubled to Rs 691 crore and there was an additional Rs 3,020 crore impact through deferred tax adjustment, which collectively shaved-off a major chunk from the bottomline and prevented the bank from reporting a four times increase in profits. Including the profit, its overall capital adequacy stood at 16.04 per cent as against the regulatory mandate of over 11 per cent.  The bank also said while there is a slowdown in demand, there are supply-side constraints as well which it is trying to overcome through digital interventions, the management said, adding it is in liquidity surplus at present.  It may look at floating rate deposit products in the three-four month's tenor, and also at other benchmarks on the lending side beyond the repo rate to price the loans, the management said.

A two-member bench headed by NCLT President Justice M M Kumar observed that ICICI Bank has already raised similar claims against its parent company Era Infra Engineering, which is currently undergoing resolution process.  The tribunal held that ""on account of duplicacy"" of the claims, the petition filed by ICICI Bank ""can not be entertained"".  ""This is again raised for admission in the present proceeding. Such a course obviously is not permissible in law...,"" it said.  The tribunal observed that the application filed by ICICI Bank to initiate insolvency proceedings against Era Infrastructure was based on the same sets of facts and documents which the resolution professional (RP) of Era Infra Engineering had earlier rejected.  Later, NCLT had on December 6, 2018 directed the RP of Era Infra Engineering to admit the said claims as financial debt of the company.  Era Infra Engineering was in the first list of 12 defaulting companies which was issued by Reserve Bank of India, directing banks to recover debts through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (IBC) Code.  ICICI Bank had given a loan of Rs 240 crore to Era Infrastructure India. For the loan, its parent firm Era Infra Engineering had guaranteed the payments, which were later defaulted on.  Meanwhile, corporate insolvency was initiated against the parent firm Era Infra Engineering by NCLT and its RP had invited claims.  ICICI Bank had lodged its claim before the RP placing reliance on securities and contractual comfort provided by Era Infra Engineering towards the entities and group companies related to it.  However, the RP had rejected its claims on September 13, following which ICIC Bank approached the NCLT. The tribunal had admitted ICICI Bank's plea on December 6, 2018 and had directed RP to admit the claims.

The markets regulator had issued the private lender a show-cause notice for not disclosing alleged conflict of interest in dealings between its MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar and Videocon Group.In a statement, the bank said, “We have submitted our response to the show-cause notice issued by Sebi. We would like to clarify that we have not filed any application for settlement.” A consent plea is possible when Sebi moves against a regulated entity for violation of the regulator’s rules, and the entity in turn agrees to settle the charges by paying some monetary penalty without accepting or denying the charges of wrongdoings. Sebi chief Ajay Tyagi and its four whole-time members were replying to media queries during the regulator’s board meeting earlier in the day. According to Sebi, both Kochhar and the bank have replied to the notices.In May this year, Sebi had sent show-cause notices to ICICI Bank and its MD & CEO Kochhar, who’s now on leave, to explain why the regulator should not move against them for governance lapses relating to loans given to Videocon Group. Tyagi said, “Some replies have come, we are examining that...am not sure about whether they have filed for consent…I believe the bank has informally discussed (the same).”It was widely alleged that while the lender advanced loans to the Mumbai-based business house, around the same time Kochhar’s husband Deepak was a beneficiary of a deal with Videocon Group.

Chaturvedi, 65, will replace current chairman M K Sharma, whose term ends on June 30. In a statement, ICICI Bank said the 1977-batch IAS officer from the Uttar Pradesh cadre, who retired in January 2013, has been appointed for a three-year term beginning July 1. Commenting on his appointment, Chaturvedi said he is looking forward to taking up the new assignment but it was too early to say what his priorities or action plan for the bank would be.  ""I don't subscribe to this that (ICICI Bank) is in a mess. Incidents keeping happening, we have to learn lessons from them, rectify them and move ahead. I am sure we will be able to do that,"" he said. Chaturvedi, who retired as Oil Secretary in January 2013, served in the Department of Financial Services -- the administrative department of banking and insurance sector -- for five years, including as Additional Secretary.

Bakshi will report to Kochhar and will handle the day-to-day operations in her absence.The bank has maintained that its board has full faith in Kochhar.According to regulatory sources, Sebi's preliminary examination findings are based on enquiries made by the regulator in the matter involving Kocchar, ICICI Bank and Videocon Group.As per the report, Kochhar has admitted that her husband Deepak Kocchar has had many dealings with Videocon Group over the last several years.Besides, it has also been admitted by her that Deepak Kocchar and Venugopal Dhoot were co-founder and promoters of NuPower.Further, in June 2009, shares of Dhoot and Pacific Capital (owned by Deepak Kocchar's father and sister-in-law) in NuPower were sold to Supreme Energy. Also, Dhoot continues to hold an interest in NuPower through debentures of Rs 64 crore, subscribed through Supreme Energy, the regulator found.Association of Deepak Kocchar and Videocon has also been confirmed in case of Credential Finance.On the basis of the preliminary report, Sebi has concluded that there was a conflict of interest in the transactions of ICICI Bank with Videocon.By not disclosing the details of her husband's dealings with Videocon, Kochhar has not complied with the provisions of listing agreement. Further, the bank also failed in ensuring that its directors comply with listing rules, the official said.Therefore, adjudication proceedings have been recommended against ICICI Bank and Kochhar, he added.Last week, Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi had said the regulator is yet to receive a reply from ICICI Bank on the allegations involving Kochhar.The cases under scanner include the bank's Rs 3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012 and the involvement of Kochhar's family members in the restructuring of the loan.Kochhar and her family members are facing allegations of quid pro quo and conflict of interest with respect to a loan extended to certain entities.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-favours-adjudication-proceedings-against-icici-bank-kochhar/articleshow/64734630.cms

An independent enquiry conducted by retired Supreme Court judge B N Srikrishna has indicted Kochhar, who had led the bank for nearly a decade, for violating various regulations, following which the lender decided to stop all unpaid retirement benefits and also recover bonuses paid to her since 2009. The conclusions of the report were definitive -- Chanda Kocchar had violated ICICI Bank's conflict of interest policy and failed in her fiduciary responsibility, advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services said in a statement, adding that as a consequence, the report asked for a clawback of her bonuses and stock options from April 2009.  These developments have been a distraction for the lender in what has clearly been a particularly challenging year for all banks, it said. The conclusive outcome has provided an opportunity to re-examine its processes and strengthen them - especially those related to conflict of interest. ICICI Bank, its employees and the board must now quickly move on, it said. ""...the completion of this investigation will help bring some level of closure for the bank's investors,"" it said.

The allegations pertain to incorrect accounting of interest income on non-performing assets (NPAs) as fees and overvaluation of security provided for corporate loans.The anonymous complaint, received in March 2018, pertains to loans disbursed in earlier years and is distinct from the one which is the subject of inquiry by Justice B N Srikrishna. While Srikrishna’s investigations are into charges that MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar faced conflict of interest disbursing loans to Videocon, the latest disclosure pertains to income recognition.The bank said that of the 31 loans, 29 were fully classified as NPAs between FY12 and FY17 and two accounts were classified as NPAs by December 2017. The aggregate loans (adjusted for write-offs) outstanding as of March 2018 were Rs 6,082 crore — above 1.1% of the bank’s gross loans. According to RBI regulations, once a borrower defaults, any repayment by the borrower cannot be treated as income. These repayments have to go into a separate account until the loan is repaid. 64708211 A statement issued by the bank to the stock exchanges said that the anonymous communication was treated as a whistleblower complaint and an enquiry was instituted according to the company’s policy. This was done under the supervision of the audit committee of the board of directors, without the involvement of the senior management other than internal audit.“The interim report of the enquiry was reviewed in detail by the audit committee and statutory auditors prior to finalisation of accounts for the year ended March 2018,” the bank has said. It added that the findings were shared with the regulator and did not have any impact on the FY18 results.Pointing out that its classification of bad loans was in line with RBI regulations, ICICI Bank said that if the difference between the bank’s asset classification and what was noticed in RBI inspection was over 15%, the bank was bound to disclose it. “No disclosure was required to be made by the bank with respect to RBI’s supervisory process for FY17,” ICICI Bank said in its letter.

""Further actions in this matter are being/ will be taken as directed by the Audit Committee,"" the bank said in a stock exchange filing. ICICI Bank's CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar, who is facing an independent enquiry in connections with loan given to Videocon Group, has decided go on leave till the completion of the inquiry. The bank, in a stock exchange filing, said that in March 2018 it was ""made aware"" on the complaint which alleged, among other things irregularities in the conduct of some borrower accounts, resulting in incorrect asset classification. The complaint cited 31 loan accounts. ""The complaint was treated as a whistle blower complaint and an enquiry was instituted as per the Whistle Blower Policy of the Bank under the supervision of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, without involvement of the senior management other than Internal Audit,"" ICICI Bank said. The statutory auditors were provided periodic updates and their inputs were factored into the enquiry process. The interim report of the enquiry was reviewed in detail by the Audit Committee and statutory auditors, prior to finalisation of the accounts for the year ended March 31, 2018. ""The findings in the interim report had no material impact on the financial statements for FY2018. The interim report has also been submitted to the regulator,"" the private sector lender said. It further said the loans outstanding were fully classified as non-performing, with provisions made as per applicable norms. These accounts were classified as non-performing between the year ended March 31, 2012 and the year ended March 31, 2017, other than two accounts which were classified by December 31, 2017. ""Thus, all these loans had been classified as non- performing prior to the Bank becoming aware of the complaint,"" the filing said. The aggregate loans (in the 31 cases) outstanding at March 31, 2018 were Rs 6,082 crore (USD 898 million), about 1.1 per cent of gross loans. The provision coverage (including prudential/ technical write-offs) was 50 per cent. Further, based on the procedures performed in the enquiry, the allegations relating to incorrect accounting of interest income and NPA recoveries as fees, and overvaluation of security for corporate loans, ""were not borne out"". Also, no disclosure on divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs was required to be made by the bank with respect to RBI's annual supervisory process for 2016-17, it added.

Unlike other software-based loans, the digital credit planned by the bank will be available to non-customers and new-to-credit borrowers.The bank will announce partnerships with e-commerce firms, following which buyers on the site will get a ‘pay later’ option. The ‘pay later’ facility will be available to even those who have not availed of any loan in the past and for small amounts of up to Rs 20,000. These borrowers should make a bullet repayment after a month.Speaking to TOI, Anup Bagchi, executive director, ICICI Bank, said that the bank would price these loans similar to credit card advances. In the West, payday loans are advances that fund the low-income individuals to make up for cash shortfalls until their salary. The difference in the ICICI Bank loan is that for the first month, the buyer will get free credit for up to 45 days. It is only if they do not pay on the due date that borrowers will be charged interest at close to credit card rates.The bank will lend to new-to-credit customers based on their track record with the e-commerce provider. For instance, any customer who has made a few purchases using the cash-on-delivery option will be eligible for credit. “By using the ‘Pay later’ feature, customers can build their credit profile slowly. This will help them to avail secured credit in future,” said Bagchi. According to Bagchi, more than 50 parameters would be used to establish the credentials of the buyer. “Today, due to technology, it is possible to establish creditworthiness in many ways. The traditional Western method of looking at financial data provides details of past behaviour, whereas it is possible to build surrogates that can predict behaviour,” said Bagchi.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-plans-payday-type-loans-in-pact-with-e-tailers/articleshow/60724882.cms

From June this year, employees ","MUMBAI: Progressive organisations are paying greater attention to personal issues of employees. It’s not just fertility leaves, companies are now offering fertility allowances to employees. While ICICI Bank and Godrej already gave such leaves, Salesforce has decided to offer employees a fertility allowance. From June this year, employees at the customer relationship management company have been extended an allowance of Rs 1.65 lakh for fertility treatments. These can include traditional infertility medical procedures, diagnostic testing, egg harvesting & freezing costs and in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) consultation. All employees — whether single, married or living together — would be covered in India apart from other markets in the world. Salesforce VP (employee success-APAC) Edweena Stratton said, “The reality is that infertility is a complex issue, and some of the biggest challenges associated with it have been the high cost and the stigma surrounding it. The good news is that more people are being vocal about their struggles, and we are becoming more aware of the problem. We will continue to provide benefits for our employees that support today’s modern family landscapes.” 65694435 At Godrej Industries and Associate Companies (GILAC), leave for fertility treatments can be taken as part of the group’s sick leave policy. “We also cover IVF treatments as part of our medical reimbursement policy,” said GILAC head (group HR and corporate services) Sumit Mitra.ICICI Bank, on the other hand, provides 180 days of paid fertility leaves to its employees. The average cost of such treatments are in the range of Rs 1-1.50 lakh, depending on the scale and duration of the treatment.Matters relating to fertility, which are largely personal issues, are catching the attention of progressive organisations as these can enhance stress levels in employees, which can impact productivity. In addition to fertility leave, organisations have come up with new types of leaves like compassionate and surrogacy leaves to help employees cope better.Specialist talent solutions company Xpheno’s co-founder Kamal Karanth said, “We all know the women dropout ratio from work is high. The number of women who need or avail of these kinds of leaves is statistically insignificant. But it enhances the way employees, especially women, look at the organisations. These policies definitely increase employer branding, which also have a slender impact on retention of women workforce... it’s a huge feel-good factor for employees to know their employers care.”According to an EY report, infertility, the inability to conceive by natural means, is a medical condition with high prevalence affecting nearly 10-15% of married couples in India. More than 27 million couples who are actively seeking children suffer from infertility, it said. Infertility attributable to male factors, too, is on the rise and constitutes 30-40% of all infertility cases.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cos-push-we-care-branding-offer-allowance-for-fertility-treatment/articleshow/65693704.cms

Kochhar, 57, has also resigned from all subsidiaries of the bank including ICICI Securities where she had sought reappointment as the chairperson.  The board elevated Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sandeep Bakhshi as the new managing director and CEO for five years until October 3, 2023, ICICI Bank said in a statement.  The bank further said that the external enquiry instituted by the board against Kochhar in May will continue and the benefits to her would be subject to the outcome of the probe.  Following the board's decision to institute an enquiry by retired Supreme Court Justice B N Srikrishna, Kochhar went on leave in May.  There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis.  ""The enquiry instituted by the Board (against Kochhar) will remain unaffected by this and certain benefits will be subject to the outcome of the enquiry. Kochhar will also relinquish office from the Board of Directors of the Bank's subsidiaries,"" the statement said.  ""The Board of Directors of ICICI Bank accepted the request of Chanda Kochhar to seek early retirement from the Bank at the earliest,"" it said.  Kochhar's current five-year tenure as CEO was to end on March 31, 2019.

There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis.  It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.  There are also allegations that NuPower got investments of Rs 325 crore from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia.  The investments from Ruia's son-in-law's firm into NuPower started in December 2010. Incidentally, the same month ICICI Bank was the lead banker in a consortium of Indian banks that extended a USD 530 million loan to Essar Steel Minnesota LLC on December 29, 2010. This loan was later classified as NPA.

ICICI,2018-08-28T04:00:00+05:30,"Mayur Shetty,Sanjay Dutta",Power cos with Rs 1.7L-crore bad loans face insolvency,India Business News: MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Private power companies defaulting on an estimated Rs 1.,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Private power companies defaulting on an estimated Rs 1.7-lakh-crore loans to 34 projects ran out of time to avoid insolvency proceedings on Monday, with the Allahabad high court refusing to grant interim relief. The court’s decision leaves no other option for lenders but to initiate insolvency proceedings, according to the RBI’s directive to banks to initiate the same against defaulters if a resolution plan was not finalised within six months. In February, the RBI had tightened norms for settling bad debt by setting timelines for resolving non-performing assets (NPAs). The circular also said even a day’s delay in servicing loans should be viewed as default and banks must identify incipient stress.This single clause hit stressed power projects the most as they were caught in a web of woes caused by factors mostly beyond their control, ranging from delayed payments by state discoms, coal supply issues, delayed clearances, and late disbursement by lenders due to a myriad reasons. In some cases, promoters’ follies, such as bidding unrealistically low tariffs to win power purchase agreements (PPAs) and failure to put in capital, compounded the problem.According to SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar, neither the court decision nor expiry of the RBI deadline will have any impact on the bank’s bottom line. “Unlike the NCLT-1 and NCLT-2 list of companies, which was given by the RBI, there is no additional provisioning required in these cases. The loans have already been classified as NPAs and the provisioning requirements do not change,” Kumar said. The NCLT-1 and NCLT-2 refer to two lists, comprising 12 and 28 borrowers respectively, with borrowings of over Rs 10,000 crore, where banks were asked to start proceedings in the NCLT.The stressed power projects are part of Rs 3.7-lakh-crore loans that turned sour as of March 2018. The only hope for avoiding insolvency proceedings lies in the court asking the Centre to decide and take action under Section 7 of the RBI Act within 15 days. It has also asked a high-level empowered committee to decide within two months on resolution in consultation with the RBI. Section 7 allows the government to give such directions to a bank, which it may consider in the public interest, after consultation with the RBI governor.Banks had taken 18 power projects to the NCLT. There are also eight cases which have been resolved. Another eight were referred for resolution under ‘Samadhan’ — a resolution scheme floated by the government. However, since four of these were found to be unviable, they are in for insolvency proceedings. Sharekhan AVP (research) Lalitabh Shrivastawa said, “Of the 34 companies, there is a probability of decent resolution for loans of around Rs 70,000 crore. But for the remaining Rs 1 lakh crore, the recovery is likely to be meagre and banks may have to take a higher hair cut.” SBI, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are among those with high exposure to the power sector.The Allahabad HC had earlier ordered lenders to avoid acting against power producers after they sought relief against RBI’s new stress resolution norms. Also, in a relief to power producers, the Supreme Court had refused to stop Allahabad HC from hearing these petitions.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/power-cos-with-rs-1-7l-crore-bad-loans-face-insolvency/articleshow/65569015.cms

The official also made it clear that the ministry is not looking into the happenings at ICICI Bank as it is completely under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  ""The ministry is looking at allegations with respect to fraudulent, preferential or under-valued transactions... those companies which have come into controversy in the light of ICICI Bank issue,"" the official said.  However, he did not divulge specific details about the companies involved.  Last month, the board of ICICI Bank ordered an independent probe into allegations of 'conflict of interest' and 'quid pro quo' in MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar's dealing with certain borrowers.  There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis. It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.

Amit Gopal Bhesaniya is a native of Fareni village in Dhoraji taluka in Rajkot. Rajendrasinh Chudasama, Bharuch district superintendent of police, said, “Amit was visiting Ankleshwar when he went around to different banks in the town and observed the working pattern of employees there.”Amit had reached Ankleshwar from Ahmedabad on August 13. He reached ICICI Bank’s branch near Pratin Hotel at Ankleshwar. He noticed that the cabin next to cashier's counter was empty. The cashier went out of the counter for a few minutes and Amit within minutes collected several bundles of Rs2,000 and Rs500 notes and escaped from the bank. ICICI Bank manager Rahul Kher lodged a complaint about the theft at Ankleshwar police station. CCTV footages identified a young boy as suspect and thus his photos were circulated to different police stations across Gujarat. Finally, the boy was identified as Amit and a police team led by police Inspector Sunil Tarde arrested him from Rajkot. Police have recovered Rs15.25 lakh cash, jewellery worth Rs3.25 lakh and a mobile phone and a vehicle from him.

ICICI,2018-08-19T15:04:00+05:30,Rachel Chitra,How one piece of tech made online payments simple,India Business News: Rarely do you see a technology developed in India spawning a whole ecosystem. But that’s what has happened with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) d,"Rarely do you see a technology developed in India spawning a whole ecosystem. But that’s what has happened with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) digital platform, launched by the National Payments Corporation of India in 2016.The ease and speed of money transfer it enables through mobile phones has created a bouquet of opportunities, which many entrepreneurs and startups have exploited, and which in turn has led to an explosion in growth of UPI-based payments.One of the biggest beneficiaries has been payment ventures. Payment banks like Paytm, small finance banks like Equitas and wallets like Mobikwik and Oxigen have seen UPI transactions surge. One of UPI’s key breakthroughs for these startups has been its interoperable framework. A single application is enough to access different bank accounts. And you don’t need difficult-to-remember and difficult-to-access bank account numbers and IFSC codes of bank branches to make UPI transactions, unlike in the case of NEFT and RTGS that have been the traditionally dominant modes of electronic money transfers.""UPI has helped us gain a more broad-based user base as it’s faster, simpler and smoother for transactions. Also, the stickiness is higher among UPI customers, compared to other modes of payment,"" says Sangram Singh, CEO of Freecharge, a wallet venture that was acquired by Axis Bank last year. UPI transactions are now 30% of Freecharge’s total transactions.Large banks too acknowledge that their partnerships with UPIenabling ventures have helped them grow their businesses. B Madhivanan, chief technology and digital officer at ICICI Bank, which has partnered with about 15 startups, said that of the 13 million users of its mobile payment applications as of March 31, 2018, only about 35% were ICICI Bank customers. In other words, the large majority are non-ICICI Bank users, something that has been made possible by the interoperability of the UPI platform.Investors have recognised this promise of UPI, and it’s a major reason why investments into payments startups have surged. It touched $1.6 billion in 2017-18, from just $197.5 million the year before, according to data from research firm Tracxn.But payment ventures are only a part of the UPI story, even if a big part of it. Others include those who provide point-of-sale (PoS) terminals and payment gateway services that can enable merchants to use UPI — such as Bijlipay, Innoviti, RazorPay, and Net-Suite; those that help to get merchants onto the platform through technology solutions — such as Ezetap, Mswipe, JusPay, and Atom Technologies; and those who build UPI-enabled mobile apps — such as Ndot, Mobibiz, and Goodwork Labs.UPI’s simplicity has dramatically reduced costs, which gives startups a more level playing field. Where a payment gateway earlier needed to build relationships with every bank, now a single relationship with UPI is all that’s required for the gateway to enable its customers to connect to any bank.Mandar Agashe, founder of Sarvatra, which counts ICICI Bank, Paytm, cooperative banks and regional rural banks among its customers, notes that earlier you could make payments only from your bank account, but with UPI, any bank’s mobile app can be used by any bank customer, leading to customer independence and mobility. ""We have had an unbelievable 100x growth in UPI in the last year,"" he says.Hemant Gala, head of payments, banking and financial services at Flipkart’s PhonePe, notes that payments earlier had to be made at individual merchant websites or apps, but with UPI, integration and interoperability has been rapid. ""From our PhonePe app you can now book hotel rooms using Goibibo, bus tickets on RedBus, pay for cab rides, buy on Zomato, Flipkart, Jabong, recharge mobiles, pay DTH bills, electricity bills, municipal payments and credit card dues,"" he says. That level of convenience is bringing in more users and further expanding the ecosystem. It’s now reaching tier-2 and tier-3 towns.A new version of UPI is expected this month, which could widen opportunities for startups. UPI 2.0 is expected to contain features such as amount blocking (ensuring sufficient funds in the bank before availing a service), which will help hotel aggregators. ""We expect amount blocking to be a game changer, just as cash on delivery was for ecommerce players,"" says Vishwas Patel, chairman of the Payments Council of India, an apex body representing companies in payments and settlement systems.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-one-piece-of-tech-made-online-payments-simple/articleshow/65460643.cms

Private equity funds are among such instruments. They pool money from wealthy individuals and entities (big global funds typically won’t take less than $50 million) and invest in aggressive and unconventional ways. Some of their bets fail but the others make spectacular returns. When things go well, investors end up with a rate of return that makes them very, very happy.It’s a bare knuckled, high-adrenaline business at heart, involving buying companies and making tough decisions to turn them around or take them apart to unlock the value in their parts. Talented fund managers are coveted, and can make multi-million dollar commissions in the deals they engineer. It also involves heart-stopping levels of risk-taking and highstakes decision-making. 65370177 This particular slice of rarefied high finance is having quite the moment in India. The year 2017 was its biggest yet, and 2018 is already looking like it’s going to be bigger. The industry is also witnessing a stream of exits by highprofile fund managers, who are setting up their own funds. More than 100 funds are looking to raise $15 billion in India right now. And while global giants such as Blackstone, Carlyle, KKR and TPG have thus far dominated the business, Indian business families are getting serious about PE investing, and that could change the game in significant ways.In 2017, funds operating in India set new records, with investments in excess of $26 billion and exits from investments at $16 billion. The exits were aided by a booming IPO market. More than $5 billion worth of Indiafocused funds were raised globally, with a similar amount raised from within the country. The first half of 2018 saw a slight slowing of the investment run rate but the exits topped all records, with the aid of the Flipkart-Walmart deal, to touch $26 billion. Even without Flipkart, 2018 has seen $11 billion worth of PE exits already. But there were other kinds of exits happening as a sideshow to this furious deal making. A string of high-profile fund managers started quitting marquee companies to set up shop on their own.In this industry, the team stability is often key to success, and the top teams of many PE funds have often worked together for a decade, seeing investments through from deal to exit. The churn in the industry is in some ways the fruit of its own success, giving senior professionals the confidence to go it along. 65369362  65369352 Mathew Cyriac, co-head of global PE fund Blackstone in India, quit early in 2017 and later bought out some Blackstone assets at a discount. Shankar Narayanan, former managing director in India at global PE fund Carlyle, quit in early 2018 and announced last week the first fund raise of $100 million for his own PE venture Sanaka Capital. Devinjit Singh, another Carlyle veteran, who quit in June 2018, has already joined hands with two other industry veterans —Ajay Relan and P Srinivasan — and has applied for a licence with SEBI for a PE fund named Xponentia. Many more senior pros have left and some like Manoj Dengla of Carlyle, Harsha Raghavan of Fairbridge, Niten Malhan of Warburg Pincus, Nikhil Raghavan of Bain and Ashish Khandelia of KKR have already declared their intention to set up new funds.By one estimate, more than 100 funds, old and new, are trying to raise an estimated $15 billion India-centric PE funds right now. The people churn in the industry has much to do with flux — some that they seek, and others that have spurred them to make a move.Many are feeling inspired by the China model and how the country has a bunch of independent home-grown PE funds and home-grown investors. A senior pro who quit recently says India should have at least 15-30 independent PE entrepreneurs attracting global and local capital flows.“I do not see the flood of new funds stopping any time soon,” says Sanjeev Krishan, partner and leader for private equity and deals at PwC. Arpan Sheth, who leads the PE practice in India at Bain & Company, adds that funds will soon be competing for deals and even the Indian players will be writing out large cheques for companies, previously a domain for the global PE giants. “There are now more $1billion PE funds and there will be even more in the future,” Sheth adds.Restless ProsIn June this year, Mayank Tiwari had quit PE firm KKR as director and country head for its operations arm, KKR Capstone. Tiwari’s role was to make sure the investee companies remain in good health. He is moving to a job in West Asia, to manage investments for a group of HNIs. As he prepares for the transition, Tiwari is enjoying being a more hands-on father for his 4-month-old child. Tiwari is a trained tabla and drums players, sings for a band, and loves singing “Phoolon ka taron ka” for his daughter Norah, named after Norah Jones. In many ways, bringing up a child can be an analogy for what Tiwari does — seeing businesses turn around and grow to maturity. He identifies the lack of buyout deals in India, where a PE firm gets majority control, as a stumbling block. Along with that, Tiwari feels Indian PE industry is at the right place for an entrepreneurial breakout. “PE as an asset class is coming of age in India. In the last 10-12 years, it has seen at least two cycles. It is ripe for entrepreneurship, and senior investors now have enough experience, insights and battle scars,” Tiwari says. 65370183 ET Magazine spoke to at least half a dozen senior pros who have quit and are trying to launch their own funds. Most of them are not willing to be quoted or divulge much of their plans right now. KKR refused to comment.Shankar Narayanan said having run funds for more than 25 years and seeing Carlyle grow from strength to strength in the last decade gave him the confidence to start his own fund now. “I felt the time had come to leverage my investing experience to create value for my investors by investing in existing profitable companies, which are growing by 30-40% per annum and are lead by entrepreneurs with drive, hunger and integrity. As these companies transitioned from being small and medium companies, I could act as a catalyst in transforming them.”While Tiwari felt hamstrung by the lack of buyouts in his operational role, many in the fund manager’s role seem to be comfortable. In fact, there is a desire to be free from rules that bind the managers working for foreign players, especially when money is available. A fund manager who started off in 2017 said on conditions of anonymity: “Fund managers get frustrated because the straitjacket formula of the US is applied in India. Buyout deals are ahead of their time in India. A cookie cutter approach (having strict formats within which a deal must fit) for a global fund also restricts the number of deals a firm can do in India.” 65369382 Thankfully, there is no lack of funds. Globally, at the end of 2017, the PE industry had around $1 trillion of surplus to invest across the world and a lot of that is headed towards India. There are also different sovereign funds and pension funds that are trying to set up operations in India, looking for managers. Global funds seek out fund managers with global pedigree — much like Narayanan or Singh or Cyriac.  65369592 India’s PE industry has gone through a similar cycle before. In 2007-2011, a clutch of professionals started their own funds. Renuka Ramnath-led Multiples, Sameer Sainled Everstone and Manish Kejriwal-led Kedaraa Capital have done well, but many others fell by the way side. After the 2008 financial crash, fund raising was a tough ask. This time around, the larger crop of startup PE funds are likely to see more money. One of the founders of the earlier crop of PE entrepreneurs said that the first 18 months is typically a difficult period, which makes or breaks the fund. Once the money is raised, the fun begins.New Money, New TrendsApart from the entrepreneurs, larger groups and financial players like the Tatas, Aditya Birla Group, IDFC, IL&FS and ICICI Bank also started their own funds in that period. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal also bet on PE, choosing a 30-year-old chartered accountant from Kolkata to lead its push. Vishal Tulsyan remembers those days well. His was clearly the wrong profile, wrong pedigree (no MBA from the US). Neither MOSL nor Tulsyan himself had any PE experience, and he was too young. 65370205  65369407 Tulsyan recalls how he spent travelling between Dubai and Oman for the first 100 days, meeting investor after investor, and living out of a “bag and a suitcase”. It was hard to convince people, but Tulsyan had the tailwind of 2007 behind him and raised $115 million for the small- and mid-cap-focused fund, mostly from wealthy individuals in West Asia. Today, while Tulsyan is raising his third fund of Rs 1,500 crore ($200 million), it is a vastly different story. “This was easier. We have 70% of the investors from India itself and we have taken a horizon of 10+2 years, unlike our first fund, which was 7+2 years.”MOSL PE, of course, has a track record today, having invested in a host of small and mid-sized companies, dealing with packaged foods to incense sticks, and having taken some of them through their IPOs. The 13 companies that got investments from the first fund had a combined valuation of Rs 3,200 crore at the time when MOSL PE invested in them, and are currently valued at Rs 70,000 crore. The fund has provided gross 27% returns.There is now growing awareness among Indian business families about new ways of investing their money. While the larger ones like Aditya Birla or Piramal end up starting their own PE initiatives, there are others who manage their funds through family offices and these have started putting their faith in private equity funds. The Indian regulatory regime has also helped. Last year, India-registered PE funds, which are category II Alternative Investment Funds, were allowed to make pre-IPO investments in companies.For Devinjit Singh of Xponentia, a key factor that encourages his decision to jump into entrepreneurship was how often Indian family offices that manage investments of business families were being discussed in PE circles, and how their structures were changing to become more aligned with investing in PE funds. “Most such families have limited or no allocation to alternative assets such as private equity, and as economies evolve this is bound to change. Private equity provides a much needed diversification for their portfolios, and I believe will drive the growth of local asset managers such as Xponentia,” he says. 65369419 Sponsored funds like Tata Capital PE also changed how these kind of funds operate. They wrote in rules to ensure they won’t end up investing in lacklustre group companies, which is a big worry with sponsored funds.Akhil Awasthi, the head of the growth fund at Tata Capital PE, points out that the landscape for PE funds in India has changed in many more ways apart from local money being available. He says: “Boundaries are disappearing. Most sectoral funds, apart from realty, have not worked and they are being merged. PE funds are also facing competition from early-stage investors like venture funds in the deals that are in the range of $50 million.” Instead of sectors, Awasthi now invests on themes, such as urbanisation.The global PEs have also followed cues. To take on the Indian opportunity properly and the lack of buyout deals in India, the global PEs have merged their teams. Carlyle merged their growth and buyout teams recently, possibly triggering the exodus in personnel. TPG Capital and TPG Growth, too, have merged their PE teams in India. TPG Growth used to look at deals below $70 million in size.Meanwhile, a route to buyouttype control has also opened up. The NCLT and the insolvency resolution process for debt-laden businesses now offers complete control. India has seen distressed funds being set up. One of them, a Piramal-Bain tie-up, had recently locked horns with Aditya Birla Group for a takeover of Binani Cements. Neeraj Bharadwaj heads Carlyle India, a global PE Fund that is also grappling with exodus of senior management. Bharadwaj, who grew up in different cities of north India following his bureaucrat father’s postings, sees value in old things. For instance, he even wears his late father’s Titan watch, in the old fashioned manner with the dial placed on the inside of the wrist. However, when it comes to NCLT, Bharadwaj is clear it is a wholly new ball game and Carlyle will not enter a sector just because it is available. “We are looking at options. I think the sectors we like will be sectors which we invest in globally.” He emphasises that the game of turning around a company is different from backing an entrepreneur — it will need re-building of the management and hiring a new CEO. 65369471  65369504 Incidentally, the industry has an association or an advocacy body of its own. Padmanabh Sinha, who heads the opportunities fund at Tata Capital, is also currently the chairman of the Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (IVCA). The IVCA has been engaging with the central government and also spending time on educating Indian investors. Sinha says: “In China, the domestic investor base in private equity funds is huge. In comparison, it is far smaller in India.” IVCA has more than 130 members as of now.Narayanan of Sanaka also feels there is a long way ahead for India. While on the one hand walls have collapsed between different kinds of funds, there is still a need to have a variety in approach. “We are still a very young industry. India, being the fastest growing large economy in the world with a buoyant entrepreneur ecosystem, will needs billions of dollars of investment each year through private equity to achieve the growth aspirations. I believe the industry will have various types of funds to provide the capital,” he says.The challenges ahead are clear. For maturity, Indian PE industry will have to show it has returned more money overall than what has been invested in the funds by investors. Exits must be higher than investments at the industry level. Not just year wise, but also at the cumulative level. And so while the new funds will make news, the performance of the older ones will also have to be keenly watched.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-are-so-many-indian-fund-managers-quitting-private-equity-firms/articleshow/65373416.cms

Deepak Kochhar is the Founder and CEO of NuPower Group, as per its website. Alleged lapses involving ICICI Bank's MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband and other family members, with respect to a loan extended to Videocon Industries by the lender have come under the regulatory lens. NuPower Renewables and NuPower Wind Farms are among the six companies whose books are being inspected by the ministry. On April 23, the ministry ordered an inspection of ""books and papers"" of six companies linked to the ICICI Bank loan controversy. They are NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd, Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd, Pacific Capital Services Pvt Ltd, Videocon Industries Ltd, NuPower Wind Farms Ltd and EchandaUrja Pvt Ltd. A senior ministry official said that Deepak Kochhar has been summoned later this month for questioning in connection with the case. However, specific details could not be immediately ascertained. The inspection is being carried out by the office of the Regional Director (Western Region) under the ministry. It was ordered under Section 206(5) of the Companies Act. Section 206 provides powers to call for information, inspect books and conduct inquiries. According to Section 206 (5), the central government may, if it is satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, direct inspection of books and papers of a company by an inspector appointed by it for the purpose. Last month, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs P P Chaudhary said the inspections into these six companies were ""under progress"". Chanda Kochhar and her family members are also facing allegations 'conflict of interest' and 'quid pro quo' with respect to loans extended to certain entities. The case is already being looked into by the RBI, the Sebi and the CBI.

A precedent of this was when Praveen Garg, who was earlier joint secretary in Department of Economic Affairs, continued to be on the board of IDBI Bank, despite being transferred to ministry of environment in March, they said. Ranjan was appointed on the board of ICICI Bank last month in place of Amit Agarwal, another joint secretary in DFS. Ranjan had on Monday and Tuesday skipped board meeting of ICICI Bank. The reshuffling comes at a time when ICICI MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar is facing allegations of conflict of interest in sanctioning of Rs 3,250 crore loan to the Videocon group.

This was followed by a slew of reports of more alleged wrongdoings and also of there being a division within the board as well.There are series of allegations of impropriety in ICICI Bank extending loans to some companies and enjoying reciprocal benefits.It is alleged that family members Kochhar, including her husband Deepak Kochhar, got financial favours from the borrowers against the loans sanctioned by the bank.The issue is being investigated by multiple agencies including a filing of a priliminary enquiry by the CBI, and probes by the Income Tax Department and the ED.Former Sebi chief M Damodaran had said one option for Kochhar was to step down till the investigation was over.The issue of compromising corporate governance practices came to the fore when investor and whistleblower Arvind Gupta raked up the issue in March.He also alleged quid pro quo between Videocon Group and Kochhar as well as her family members with respect to extending a loan worth Rs 3,250 crore, which for the past many years have been NPA.It was alleged that the Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, the husband of Chanda.There are also allegations that NuPower got Rs 325 crore investment from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, the son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia.The investments from Ruia's son-in-law's firm into NuPower started in December 2010. Incidentally, the same month ICICI Bank was the lead banker in a consortium of domestic banks that extended a USD 530 million to Essar Steel Minnesota on December 29, 2010. This loan too was later classified as bad loans.The Reserve Bank in its 2016 investigation in the matter had raised questions over the ownership of the Mauritius-based entity, First Land Holding, which had invested Rs 325 crore in NuPower.Also, there was no clarity over the alleged Rs 64- crore loan (unsecured fully convertible debentures) given to NuPower by Supreme Energy, which was 99.99 per cent owned by Videocon group chief Venugopal Dhoot at that time.While Chanda Kochhar sat on the credit committee that approved the loan to Videocon, there are allegations of conflicts of interest in her husband's Singapore-based brother Rajiv Kochhar doing the debt-restructuring work on errant corporate borrowers from ICICI, including Videocon.The restructuring wasn't commissioned by the bank but by the borrowers.Interestingly, the bank board expressed full faith in Kochhar, whose current tenure as CEO is ending March 31, 2019.It had reviewed credit approval processes and found them to be robust, according to a March 28 filing by the bank.Replying to another question, Kannan said the tenure of current chairman MK Sharma ends on June 30.

The move comes at a time when the private lender is embroiled in enquiries regarding its CEO’s conflict of interest and irregularities in recognition of 31 bad loan accounts.The shareholders’ meeting has now been rescheduled to September 12 as against August 10 planned earlier. “We wish to update that the change in AGM date and the consequent changes in record dates was necessitated due to the sequencing of general meeting dates within the listed entities of ICICI Group,” the bank said in filings to stock exchanges.The bank is yet to prepare its annual report. In 2017, it had released its annual report by May 26 and concluded its AGM on June 30. The delay could possibly be because the bank is awaiting a report from law firm Panag & Babu, which is looking into allegations of irregularities in 31 loan accounts. These allegations were made under the whistleblower policy. An earlier whistleblower complaint into allegations of irregularities against the bank’s MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar had resulted in the appointment of Justice B N Srikrishna to look into the matter. Fund managers say that foreign institutional investors, who are the predominant owners of the bank, are also raising questions on the allegations.According to bank sources, the complaint by shareholder Arvind Gupta alleging quid pro quo favours to Videocon Group for investing in a firm owned by Kochhar’s spouse is not treated as a whistleblower complaint. This is because the complaint was not made to various authorities. Besides the internal investigations, market watchdog Sebi is also looking into whether there were lapses by the bank’s CEO in not disclosing the conflict of interest. Kochhar is currently on leave till the completion of the enquiry by Justice Srikrishna.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-delays-agm-further-will-hold-it-on-sept-12/articleshow/65016305.cms

The resolution professional (RP) had declined to accept ICICI Bank's claims worth Rs 700 crore. A two-member principal bench of the NCLT also directed the RP to grant ICICI Bank a proportional voting share in the Committee of Creditors (CoC). ""The corporate debtor is liable to repay the amount granted by the ICICI Bank to Era Infra and Dehradun Highway Project as a Financial debt as per the provisions of the code,"" said the NCLT bench headed by President Justice M M Kumar. NCLT had started insolvency proceedings against Era Infrastructure in May 2018 and appointed an RP for the company. The RP had denied the claims of ICICI Bank. ""As a consequential relief, a direction is issued to RP to revise the list of financial creditors of the corporate debtor by including the claims of ICICI Bank with respect to the failities granted to Era Infrastructure and Dehradun Highways Project Ltd amounting to Rs 700 crore and credit the applicant ICICI Bank in the CoC by adding the aforesaid claims,"" the order said. It further added: ""It shall also grant the applicant its voting share in the CoC in proportion to such claims with all consequential benefits arising therefrom."" ICICI Bank had given a loan of Rs 240 crore to Era Infrastructure India and Rs 460 crore to Dehradun Highway Projects and was liable to get a repayment from the corporate debtor, according to the terms of the agreement between the parties. The RP of Era Infrastructure had, however, denied this claim saying that agreement could not be construed as akin to guarantee of repayment. The NCLT, however, rejected the RP's arguments, saying that once the corporate debtor had undertaken such obligations, the claims against the same could not be denied to the lender. ""Once it is an amount repayable, then the Resolution Professional must admit the claims of the ICICI Bank as financial debt, in respect of the obligations undertaken by the corporate debtor under the credit facilities availed by Era Infrastructure India Ltd and Dehradun Highway Project,"" NCLT said.

The assets sought to be attached by the lender include the brands Gili, Sangini and Asmi owned by Gili India and Nakshatra Brands. This is in addition to real estate assets such as land at Panvel, SEZ properties at Nashik and Hyderabad, and offices at the Bandra Kurla Complex and Seepz SEZ. 65002501 These advances are outside the Rs 13,400 crore that is due to Punjab National Bank (PNB) following a fraud committed by Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi. With total claims against the duo crossing Rs 20,000 crore, lenders say they will need to meet and decide a course of action. The Sarfaesi Act allows lenders to attach and sell property of defaulters and their guarantors. Under the law, lenders are required to give a 60-day notice before attaching the property.According to bankers, after Kingfisher Airlines, this will be a test case in brand valuation. In the case of Kingfisher, lenders have not got bidders even at a tenth of what the airline brand was valued at during the loan disbursement. Gitanjali Gems had claimed in 2009 that a valuation done by UK-based Brand Finance had valued Gili, Nakshatra, D’damas and Asmi at Rs 1,500 crore.In April this year, the private bank had approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to protect its own interest in a case filed by the corporate affairs ministry to attach properties belonging to the Modi and Choksi groups. The private lender had informed the court that ICICI Bank and 23 other lenders were planning to move the debt recovery tribunal (DRT) to recover combined loan obligations of more than Rs 8,000 crore. The advantage of proceeding in the DRT is that the lenders can go after the personal assets of the promoters. While the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) does not allow attachment of personal assets of promoters, a recent amendment in the code allows lenders to simultaneously invoke promoter guarantees.

The customer will also receive a physical copy of the policy, the need for which depends on the requirements of local police. 64954619 While the policy delivery will be a straight-through process, the claims registration will be done by company representatives who will also guide the policyholder on how to shoot the video of the damaged vehicle using his mobile phone. Future Generali has already rolled out delivery of policies through WhatsApp and has sent more than 5,200 policies via the platform as part of a pilot run, which started on June 15. WhatsApp for business is already being used by BookMyShow to deliver movie tickets and ICICI Bank also plans to start using it as a channel to communicate with customers.

By all accounts, the soft-spoken bureaucrat’s nononsense approach began the much-needed clean-up in the oil ministry, which was seen to be a hub of corporate lobbying with PSU chiefs and company chiefs often accused of influencing policies.Similarly, months before the 2010 Commonwealth Games, he was appointed special director dealing with finance and accounts for the scandal-ridden event, when there were allegations of grave irregularities.Seven years later, Chaturvedi finds himself in a similar situation, although the setting is much different. Unlike many of his colleagues, the UP cadre officer is not seen to be someone who would easily walk into a boardroom. The low-profile bureaucrat opted for a quiet retirement, after serving as the warehousing regulator.But he is no stranger to the financial services business, having served in what is now the department of financial services, where he was handling the insurance portfolio as joint secretary and then went on to become special secretary before moving to the petroleum ministry.Insurance, in fact, will be a common link between Sandeep Bakshi, the recently-appointed COO of the bank, and Chaturvedi as they guide the lender to safety after questions were raised over its corporate governance policies and the handling of the controversy involving managing director and CEO Chanda Kochhar, who has proceeded on leave till investigations are completed.Chaturvedi’s appointment is also seen as the government getting a stronger foothold on the ICICI Bank board where it already has a nominee, despite holding no shares in the erstwhile financial institution. Bakshi, who was in the capital last week, met senior officials, including some in the PMO and many see Friday’s board decision flowing from consultations with the government.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govts-firefighter-lands-in-icici/articleshow/64800925.cms
ICICI,2017-06-25T11:02:00+05:30,PTI,SBI chief's salary zilch compared to counterparts in pvt banks,"India Business News: New Delhi, Jun 25 () SBI, one of the world's 50 largest banks, pays only a small fraction to its top management as compared to private sector players ","New Delhi, Jun 25 () SBI, one of the world's 50 largest banks, pays only a small fraction to its top management as compared to private sector players like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan had flagged the low remuneration issue last August saying it makes difficult for state-owned banks to ""attract top talent, especially a lateral entry"". According to annual reports of various banks, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya took home Rs 28.96 lakh last fiscal, which is pittance when compared to remuneration her counterparts in private banks receive. In comparision, ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar received a basic salary of Rs 2.66 crore last fiscal besides Rs 2.2 crore performance bonus. In addition, she received allowances and perquisites of over Rs 2.43 crore. Similarly, Shikha Sharma, MD and CEO of Axis Bank, took home a basic salary of Rs 2.7 crore and Rs 1.35 crore as variable pay, besides host of perk and allowances, like Rs 90 lakh HRA. Yes Bank MD and CEO Rana Kapoor, who also happens to be promoter of the bank, took home Rs 6.8 crore as salary in 2016-17. HDFC Bank's Managing Director Aditya Puri saw his remuneration rise marginally to Rs 10 crore and exercised stock options worth over Rs 57 crore during the last fiscal. Speaking about public sector banks at a banking conference in Mumbai, Rajan had said state-owned banks tended to overpay at the bottom but underpay their top executives. He jokingly said he himself was underpaid and the disparity made it harder to attract talent from outside at the top level in public sector banks. On the business front, SBI, after merger with its subsidiary banks, caters to 42.04 crore customers with a market share of 23.07 per cent and 21.16 per cent in deposits and advances, as opposed to 18.05 per cent and 17.02 per cent respectively, before the merger. The nearest rival of SBI, post merger, will have a market share of 5.96 per cent and 7.04 per cent in deposits and advances respectively. Remuneration comprises various components including basic salary, allowances and perquisite, PF, superannuation allowances, gratuity and performance bonus and payment of performance bonus is deferred over a multi-year period. Not only such high disparity in compensation makes it difficult for the government to hire top managers laterally at public sector banks, as pointed out by Rajan, it also impacts the motivation of public sector managers who have to fiercely compete with their private sector peers.

He expressed hope that uncertainties would be resolved at the earliest. The bank has appointed an independent enquiry committee on the allegations of quid pro quo and conflict of interest against Kochhar with respect to a loan given to Videocon group. Pending the enquiry, headed by former Supreme Court Judge B N Srikrishna, Kochhar has gone on a long leave from June. In the recent months, the bank has faced questions with regard to governance, Chaturvedi said in the Chairman's message to shareholders in the bank's annual report for 2017-18. ""The board of directors have instituted an enquiry to examine issues relating to the same. The scope of enquiry will be comprehensive and we hope to conclude the uncertainties relating to the issue at the earliest,"" Chaturvedi said. ""It will be my topmost priority to uphold the best governance practices at this esteemed institution,"" he added. The bank had appointed the former bureaucrat as its new non-executive part-time Chairman in late June. Chaturvedi, 65, replaced former Chairman M K Sharma whose term ended on June 30, 2018. The country's largest private sector lender registered its first ever loss in more than a decade at Rs 120 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal due to higher provisioning for bad loans. It had posted a net profit of Rs 2,049 crore in the April-June period of last fiscal. In 2017-18, the bank had posted a net profit of Rs 6,777 crore. However, its gross bad loans by end-March 2018 remained at an elevated level of 8.84 of gross advances by that period, translating into Rs 54,063 crore. ""ICICI Bank has seen its share of challenges in the recent past due to the elevated level of non-performing assets (NPAs) but has been dealing with them in the best interest of all stakeholders,"" Chaturvedi said. He said the bank has continued to focus on improving its portfolio mix, resolving stressed assets and enhancing its customer franchise. Lauding the Reserve Bank's initiative of mandating referral of large NPAs for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the Chairman said these are welcome steps aimed at accelerating resolution of existing stressed loans as well as enhancing credit discipline and proactive resolution on a sustained basis going forward. Separately, in her message to shareholders, Kochhar said in the report that the retail segment would remain the key driver of growth, with segments like business banking, credit cards and personal loans growing at a higher pace off a lower base, while home loans would continue to be the largest part of the portfolio. ""In the past four years, the bank has made significant progress in de-risking the balance sheet and continued to enhance the franchise,"" she added. ICICI Bank's tier-I capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.92 per cent and the total capital adequacy at 18.42 per cent by end-March 2018, both well above the regulatory requirements.

The agency may soon take a call on whether to call Deepak Kochhar for questioning along with Dhoot and Chanda Kochhar as there are allegations of ""conflict of interest"" on the latter's part. Sources said ICICI bank officials were examined to know more about the details of loan - Rs 3,250 crore - given by India's largest private sector bank to Videocon as part of a consortium and whether they were aware about any quid pro quo.  As reported by TOI , CBI lodged a preliminary enquiry (PE) last month against Dhoot and Deepak Kochhar apart from other bank officials. Officials said they have already examined several documents and private companies connected to the loan have also been asked to provide certain documents. CBI is investigating if Dhoot provided crores to a firm promoted by Deepak Kochhar and two relatives six months after Videocon group got Rs 3,250 crore as loan from ICICI Bank in 2012. The amount was part of the Rs 40,000-crore loan Videocon group secured from a consortium of 20 banks led by SBI .  It is alleged that Dhoot gave Rs 64 crore in 2010 through a fully owned entity to NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd, (NRPL), the company he had set up with Deepak Kochhar and two of his relatives. It is alleged that he transferred proprietorship of the company to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for Rs 9 lakh six months after he received the loan of Rs 3,250 from ICICI Bank.  ICICI Bank has defended Chanda Kochhar and said it reposed ""full faith"" in her. The bank has stated that there was no question of any favouritism, nepotism or quid pro quo in the loans to Videocon.

However, since then, top women bankers in India seem to have hit a rough patch.While Bhattacharya, even post retirement is still much revered, others unfortunately have found themselves embroiled in controversy . Even the ones with squeaky clean records had the halo wiped somewhat. It all started in April (this year) -- proverbially the cruelest month -- when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) questioned Axis Bank board's proposal to reappoint Shikha Sharma as managing director (MD) & chief executive officer (CEO) for a fourth term and asked the lender to reconsider its decision. The central bank was apparently unhappy with the bank's rising bad loans.A week later, Sharma, the longest serving woman CEO in the financial sector announced that she will step down in December 2018– two-and-a-half years before her term was due to end.Read full story: Shikha Sharma to cut tenure by 30 months Come May, Usha Ananthasubramanian, who was due to retire in August this year, from her post as MD & CEO of Allahabad Bank was stripped of her powers.

The day-to-day operations and crucial decisions relating to resolution of large non-performing assets under the insolvency process will have to be taken by the top management led by newly-appointed chief operating officer Sandeep Bakhshi.The inquiry into allegations against Kocchar is being led by Justice BN Srikrishna, who will be assisted by Luthra & Luthra a law firm and Control Risks – a risk assessment firm.

According to sou","MUMBAI: The ICICI Bank board will have to move fast to identify a new chairman in place of M K Sharma, whose term comes to an end in 10 days. According to sources, the bank was earlier looking to elevate the former Bank of Baroda chief M D Mallya as chairman. Mallya had been recently nominated to the board. However, the proposal has hit a regulatory hurdle.On May 29, the ICICI Bank board had nominated Mallya as additional director, taking the total number of independent directors to seven. The appointment was subject to shareholder approval. In addition to the outgoing chairman and Mallya, the other independent directors are Uday Chitale, Dileep Choksi, Neelam Dhawan, Radhakrishnan Nair and LIC chairman V K Sharma. The board also has a government nominee director, Lok Ranjan.There is no formal approval for appointment of members, but banks do inform the RBI and there is an informal clearance from the central bank. In the case of Mallya, the bank has already informed the RBI about bringing him on board. The appointment of chairman is, however, approved by the regulator.What is likely to delay the RBI clearance for Mallya are the ongoing investigations into the loan granted by Bank of Baroda to Rotomac Industries, whose managing director has been arrested for fraud following a default. Although loans to the group were given as part of a consortium in 2008, the central bank might wait for more clarity on the Central Bureau of Investigation's findings before clearing Mallya. Besides being on the board of ICICI Bank, Mallya is also on the board of Tata Capital.Current chairman Sharma, who has completed 70 years, has expressed his desire not to continue. ""If there is no chairman, one of the independent board members will have to be nominated as chairman,"" said a senior level source. The presence of a chairman is crucial for AGM, which will take place on August 10.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-chairman-search-hits-regulatory-hurdle/articleshow/64656697.cms

However, despite its inevitability, her 'leave of absence' was preceded by high drama that saw Kochhar adopting a belligerent stance.Although investigations by authorities have been regularly reported in the media, the bank's board had not revised its earlier statement voicing support for Kochhar. Also, in several earlier board meetings, the government's representative was absent, leading to an impression that it was keeping off the controversy. This view was supported by finance minister Piyush Goyal's statement that law would take its own course.The turning point, however, came on May 30 in a board meeting when the directors decided to appoint an external investigator. When Justice BN Srikrishna was chosen to head the inquiry, it was clear that things were going to be different. For one, MK Sharma, who had earlier been supportive of Kochhar, now asked board members whether the CEO should be asked to go on leave pending inquiry.For Kochhar, who went on her annual leave on June 1, the writing was on the wall. The board proposed to bring in Sandeep Bakhshi, who had been number two at the bank a decade ago, as chief operating officer. It was against this backdrop that the June 18 board meeting commenced.Kochhar, who had just returned from her leave, is understood to have taken an aggressive stand at the meeting. She questioned why she was being asked to go on leave as none of the regulators had asked for it.But when the chairman of the bank's largest shareholder, LIC, insisted on the course of action, it was clear that Kochhar had little choice. While she continued to resist, all the independent directors of the bank are understood to have dug in their heels in the matter.Kochhar is understood to have left the room in a huff and had to be persuaded to return. The board subsequently drafted a statement that it was a collective decision to ask Kochhar to go on leave. However, she is believed to have insisted that she would not accept such a statement.Finally a consensus statement was drafted: ""In line with the highest levels of governance and corporate standards, Chanda Kochhar has decided to go on leave till the completion of the enquiry as announced on May 30, 2018"".",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/chanda-kochhar-defiant-at-icici-board-meet/articleshow/64656346.cms

He is seen to be the right candidate ","MUMBAI: ICICI Bank is likely to see a cultural change with the entry of Sandeep Bakhshi, who has a completely different style of working compared to Chanda Kochhar. Bakhshi, who has been appointed chief operating officer (COO), will run the bank during the time when Kochhar is on leave pending an inquiry into conflict of interest allegations. Since Kochhar’s term is due to end in March 2019 and Bakhshi has a five-year term, it is believed that he will succeed Kochhar.Bakhshi, according to those who have worked with him, is down-to-earth, warm and great at relationships. He is seen to be the right candidate to communicate with all constituents and deal with regulatory headwinds. His people skills will come in handy as in seven weeks he will have to address worried shareholders and resolve concerns of regulators. Digit Insurance chairman Kamesh Goyal said, “He is very updated about the market and tracks competition closely. He believes in empowering his team. The fact that a lot of people directly reporting to him have become CEOs in general and life insurance industry demonstrates that.” Goyal and Bakhshi were rivals when the former headed Bajaj Allianz General Insurance and latter headed ICICI Lombard.  64656384 Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance MD & CEO Tarun Chugh, who reported to Bakhshi in ICICI Pru Life Insurance, said, “He has given a lot of CEOs to the insurance industry. He is one person who always put the customer first in his thinking. He builds institutions for the long term and does not bother about short-term gains.”PayU MD Jitendra Gupta, who was a mid-level executive in ICICI Bank in 2009 when Bakhshi was the deputy MD, said, “He was a real hands-on person. He never lost his cool in any situation. Bakhshi would empower people. For instance, he had let me handle the $85-million sale of the point-of-sale terminal business all by myself.” Insiders who have worked with Kochhar and Bakhshi say that both are as different as chalk and cheese. Unlike most of the leaders in the bank who began their careers from the headquarters in Mumbai, Bakhshi joined the bank in Delhi after completing his MBA from XLRI-Jamshedpur.While Kochhar was a big picture CEO, Bakhshi is one to go into details. Unlike Kochhar, who kept family and work separate, Bakhshi has admitted carrying work home.Although Bakhshi has spent his entire career with the ICICI Group, he has the widest range of experience having worked on corporate loans, general insurance, retail lending and life insurance. His last stint in the bank as head of retail coincided with the bursting of the small-ticket personal loan bubble. At that time, Bakhshi is understood to have remarked that the bank should focus on ‘return of capital’ rather than ‘return on capital’. Now with the attention on bad loan recovery, Bakhshi’s focus on ‘return of capital’ might play out well.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-to-see-cultural-change-under-bakhshi/articleshow/64655588.cms

Bakhshi, whose five-year tenure begins today, will report to Kochhar—though during her period of leave, he will report to the board. The fact that Bakshi- who was deputy MD of ICICI Bank before assuming charge of its life insurance subsidiary- has been appointed COO for five years is seen as putting him in pole position to succeed Kochhar (56). Her current term ends in March next year, and in the normal course, she could have looked forward to another, but with the cloud of multiple investigations and inquiries by CBI, Sebi and Srikrishna over her head, the odds on her continuing have lengthened considerably.

In reality, he remains a battle horse that’s galloping. Justice BN Srikrishna continues to be entrusted with resolving issues as diverse in their range as his mental prowess .In his own words, he is “disciplined, yet rebelled for a just cause”. This again, is amply on display. Even as a junior judge of the Bombay high court, he had accepted a sensitive yet onerous task of fact-finding into the events that led to the 1992-93 communal riots in Mumbai. The 77-year-old former Supreme Court judge has, as his latest assignment, to lead an inquiry into allegations of conflict of interest against ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar. Retired over a decade ago in May 2006, after four years at the apex court, Justice Srikrishna, born on the cusp of Taurus and Gemini, was on the bench in the high court for over a decade. As an HC judge, he never fought shy of speaking his mind, and he did so often at hearings that left the statutory authority at its receiving end, quivering. Srikrishna is probably doing just that to the digital age tech mighties like Google, Facebook and Amazon right now. He heads the committee that will set the pace and draft, by this month end, for a new data privacy law for India. He was put in charge last year after the landmark ruling on privacy by the Supreme Court.The active jurist, who headed the Srikrishna Commission between 1993 to 1998, is just as busy two decades later. He is also currently the chairperson of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission and, when not functioning as an arbitrator or accepting other ticklish tasks that beckon his judicious mind, he also spares time for his passions — Carnatic music, or inaugurating an exhibition, as he did the Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute at Lonavala, near Mumbai, on June 3.From issues of national importance such as data privacy to one that most central government employees thank him for — when he headed the sixth pay commission from 2006 to 2008 — the often smiling judge was even the chosen mediator for a high profile divorce of Pakistani singer Adnan Sami and his UAE wife Sabah Galadari. The mediation for an amicable settlement had failed and then the squabbling couple in 2010 went back to court to battle on.Born six years before Independence, Bellur Narayanaswamy Srikrishna graduated in law from Government Law College and went on to be one of the many legal stalwarts the Mumbai college produced.He was a leading labour law counsel when he became an HC judge directly from the bar. He had surprised, even confounded, many of his colleagues at his decision to accept a position on the bench, but it can be explained by his untiring penchant to work towards a just cause. He could rebel, from the bench, to ensure justice.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/a-jurist-for-all-seasons-reasons/articleshow/64640812.cms

Later, media reports said Srikrishna would be heading the probe.""The scope of enquiry would be comprehensive and will include all relevant matters arising out of and in the course of examination of the facts and wherever warranted, use of forensics/e-mail reviews and record statements of relevant personnel, etc,"" the bank had said on May 31.The board had on March 28 reposed full faith in Kochhar after allegations of possible conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and possible quid pro quo first surfaced against Kochhar, following a complaint by an activist.Even as the board stood by her, details of misdoings emerged in the media, leading to a multi-agency probe against Kochhar by various law enforcement agencies.The cases under scanner include the bank's Rs 3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012 and the involvement of Kochhar family members, including her husband Deepak Kochhar, in first sanctioning the loan and then restructuring the same.Interim finance minister Piyush Goyal had earlier this month said the law would take its course in the alleged case of nepotism at ICICI Bank, even though it is a good bank with ""very robust processes"" and there was no cause for concern for any of the stakeholders of ICICI Bank per se.There are also allegations that NuPower got investments of Rs 325 crore from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, the son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-board-meet-underway-on-chanda-kochhars-fate-srikrishna-panel/articleshow/64633670.cms

ET had reported that the board of directors of the private lender are discussing a reshuffle of its top management that may see its life insurance venture’s CEO Sandeep Bakhshi becoming interim chief at ICICI Bank. To be sure, the board is yet to sign off on the decision to make the changes, sources aware of the development said. This comes amid investigations into ICICI Bank chief executive Chanda Kochhar’s alleged violation of the lender’s code of conduct.The rearrangement is being contemplated by the board as BN Srikrishna, a retired Supreme Court judge, investigates the role of Kochhar, who is likely to be on leave until the investigation is complete. Srikrishna will investigate whether Kochhar violated the bank's code of conduct and the allegations relating to conflict of interest.  64627342 Kochhar is currently on her annual leave. ET has also learnt that the Incidentally, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) officials have been informally told that ICICI Prudential Life may see Bakhshi may move to a different role and that the regulator would be informed accordingly, said one of the persons. The bank has been shaken by conflict-of-interest allegations by a whistle blower against Kochhar over loans to Videocon Industries. It was alleged that she did not disclose business dealings of her husband Deepak Kochhar with the Dhoots of Videocon.While ICICI Bank chairman MK Sharma has said that the board was convinced that Kochhar was in the clear, a second accusation was made recently on similar grounds.Chanda Kochhar was on the bank’s credit committee that sanctioned a loan of Rs 3,250 crore to the Videocon Group in 2012. Videocon’s promoter Venugopal Dhoot was one of the first investors in NuPower Renewables promoted by Deepak Kochhar, Chanda Kochhar’s husband, in 2008. Dhoot subsequently sold his stake but firms controlled by him or his associates maintained a relationship with NuPower until early 2013 when control was finally transferred to a trust controlled by Deepak Kochhar for a small sum.The lender and Chanda Kochhar have denied any wrongdoing.

According to information in the bank's annual report, bonus for FY17 has not been paid out as it is pending RBI approval and therefore not disclosed. In FY17, he had received a performance bonus of Rs 92 lakh.The ratio of Puri's salary to that the median is 209:1. However, his salary has not increased in line with the 8.9 per cent average percentage increase for key managerial personnel and non-managerial staff. Puri holds around 0.13 per cent stake in the bank, which is worth about Rs 687 crore. Puri, who has led the bank for 24 years, is credited with creating the country's most valuable financial institution, which is today worth nearly Rs 5.3 lakh crore.Uday Kotak, founder and CEO of Kotak Bank, received compensation of Rs 2.92 crore in FY 18 (Rs 2.63 crore last year), which is 48.44 times the median salary in the bank.

For instance, the chairman of SBI, the country's largest bank, received compensation of Rs 14.25 lakh for the second-half of FY18 after he took charge mid-year.

Sudesh Kumari of Sector 21, Chandigarh, was denied bail for allegedly duping Sector 38 resident of Rs49 lakh on the pretext of providing him Australian visa. Sudesh’s son, Arun Saluja, who is an accused in multiple immigration frauds, has already been denied bail twice.The defence counsel argued that the accused was an old lady and had nothing to do with the said crime and that she had been falsely implicated in order to blackmail and pressurise her. It was further stated that her son is a manager with the ICICI bank and had some dealings with the complainant which Sudesh wasn’t aware of.In his complaint, Kamaldeep Verma alleged that he knew Arun for over three years and was told that Arun and his mother had direct links in Australia. The accused duo also claimed that as per the new immigration policy, they would arrange a fresh visa for him and his family on a permanent basis in 2017. They allegedly assured the complainant’s family that the entire process would be completed in six months and demanded Rs 75 lakh for the job. The complainant paid a sum of Rs 9.5 lakh on April 28 last year, 8 lakh in May, 2018, Rs 12,50,000 on May 22 and 9 lakh on June 26. Another sum of Rs 10 lakh was paid on July 7 through RTGS in the account of Sudesh Kumari.However, when the complainant inquired from Saluja and Kumari on the status of his application for the visa, no response was received. Eventually, Verma got suspicious and dug deeper in the matter.

An ongoing investigation at ICICI Bank on extending a loan with a potential conflict of interest has also focused authorities' attention on the bank's governance,"" it said in a note.The report also warns that adverse findings may create a ""reputational risk"", especially if they point at broader weaknesses in management.The agency cut its outlook on Axis Bank's issuer default rating to negative from stable, pointing out to the high proportion of NPAs and the limited capital buffers available, despite a recent infusion.It can be noted that a spike in NPAs and provisioning for the same have led the bank, which is searching for a new head after the board agreed to cut short Shikha Sharma's tenure, to report its first ever quarterly loss in Q4 of FY18.Commenting on ICICI Bank, the report said, ""capital buffers are better even though it has experienced similar financial deterioration like Axis Bank in the previous few financial years.""The agency also downgraded ICICI Bank's 'support rating' to '3', from '2', apart from revising down its support rating floor to 'BB+', from 'BBB-'.But the agency has affirmed the issuer default ratings and viability ratings of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at 'BBB-' and 'bbb-', respectively.It can be noted that both the private sector lenders have had a tumultuous time in the past few months. While ICICI Bank managing director and chief executive Chanda Kochhar is facing allegations of conflict of interest and lack of disclosures, it has been NPAs and the ensuing management change that is dogging Axis Bank.Media reports initially said the RBI was unhappy to extend Sharma's tenure by three years, after which she requested to cut the tenure, which was accepted by the board.Fitch, which has a negative outlook on domestic banks, said the new regulatory NPAs that has accelerated bad-loan recognition will help improve the health of the banking sector over the long-term.The report has further said the present NPA ratios make it believe that there has been a full recognition of the legacy problems and the ongoing bankruptcy resolutions can also help positively.""We expect the internal capital generation for the sector, including the two private sector banks, to stay weak in FY19,"" it added.The larger private sector lenders have robust deposit franchises but enjoy less depositor confidence than state- owned banks due to the latter's government ownership, but this could lead to greater changes in funding costs and liquidity in ""an extreme scenario"", the report warns.

Police said that the theft was executed in such 'professional' way that it reeked of an 'inside job'. The unidentified accused barged into the the ATM booth with a key and entered the password to take out the cash tray, said police. A case has been registered at Piplani police station and police have detained two employees of the cash refilling agency and they were being interrogated.Investigation officer SI SKS Chouhan said that the complaint was lodged by Mukesh Malviya, territory manager in Financial Software and Systems (FSS)-company that manages ATMs of State Bank of India (SBI). Malviya, in his complaint to police, stated that on Tuesday morning around 8 am an executive of the company, Shailendra Beohare, informed him that someone had broke into the ATM booth at Goyal Indralok Complex on JK Road in Piplani and made away with Rs 13.81 lakh, said Chouhan. SI Chouhan said that when police reached the spot, they found the ATM cabinet open with key hanging. The accused entered password to take out the cash tray and then they took out the cash from the machine. They then cut the wires of CCTV cameras and also took away the DVR (hard disk) on which the CCTV recordings were being recorded. The theft may have been executed between 2 am to 4 am, added Chouhan.No guards were deployed at the ATM , and the booth is located in a dark corner of the complex. No CCTV cameras were installed in the adjacent shops, which could have captured the theft, said Chouhan. This is the second major theft incident at an ATM in Piplani. Last year, on September 22, an employee of a cash refilling agency and an SAF policeman posted at Raj Bhawan were rounded up for stealing Rs 13.16 lakh from an ICICI bank ATM booth in Sonagiri.On May 12, the Hanumanganj police nabbed a former employee of a cash refilling agency, who had left job two months back. He had fraudulently accessed the password of the ATM machine and stole Rs 76,000 from the ATM located on Hamidia Road .

This was indicated by finance minister Piyush Goyal, who said that the matter was being pursued by the board internally and by regulators.When asked whether the government would take any stand on the ICICI Bank issue, Goyal said, “ICICI Bank is a good bank. It has robust processes and there is no cause for concern for any of the stakeholders of ICICI Bank per se. As far as law is concerned, the law of the land will take its own course and the processes are already going on internally in ICICI Bank and externally,” said Goyal.Although ICICI Bank is in the private sector and predominantly owned by foreign institutional investors, the government is indirectly the single largest shareholder through the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India. In addition to the LIC chairman, a senior finance ministry bureaucrat sits on the board of ICICI Bank as a government nominee.When asked about the reasons for the government nominee not attending some important board meetings where the conflict of interest was discussed, Goyal said that he was not aware of the attendance and would inquire into it.Earlier this year, Kochhar was mired in a controversy following reports that her husband Deepak Kochhar’s company received investments from Videocon Industries, which received loans from ICICI Bank. The finance minister’s comments come at a time when there are reports that ICICI Bank is looking at filing a consent plea with Sebi, which is investigating whether the company violated disclosure norms.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/law-will-take-its-own-course-in-icici-case-fm/articleshow/64514409.cms

The current repo rate stands at 6.25 per cent.Joining big banks, Indian Bank and Karur Vsya Bank informed the stock exchanges about hiking the MCLR by up to 10 basis points for different tenures.

Lack of leadership leaves these lenders struggling to formulate strategies and meet government conditions to win more funds under a record public bailout.Andhra Bank, Dena Bank and Punjab & Sind Bank have had no CEOs since the start of this year, while the head of IDBI Bank Ltd. -- which has the highest bad-loan ratio among Indian lenders -- has been named as deputy governor of Reserve Bank of india (RBI) on Monday. Allahabad Bank is effectively headless as it stripped CEO Usha Ananthasubramanian of her powers after she was formally charged last month over alleged involvement in a multi-crore fraud at a previous employer, Punjab National Bank.Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, UCO Bank, Indian Bank, United Bank of India and Corporation Bank are among lenders where the incumbent’s tenure will end by March next year.POOR PAY, MORE SCRUTINYAnother challenge in finding replacements is the low salaries on offer at state banks, when compared with their private sector peers. Ananthasubramanian earned about Rs 30 lakh at PNB in the year ended March 2017, about 5 per cent of the Rs 6 crore earned by Chanda Kochhar, the CEO of the country’s second-largest private lender ICICI Bank. While this massive discrepancy was always the case, Kanoria said intensified scrutiny of state bankers has eroded the appeal of the jobs.Current and former top executives at at least four banks are being investigated by government authorities for allegations of impropriety.Moreover, the government has said state banks will have to show that they’re cleaning up their act if they want to win fresh capital injections. These reforms include selling non-core assets and setting up separate units to manage stressed assets, steps that would need top executives to sign off on them.About 30 top-level vacancies exist at state banks, including executive directors, news agency PTI reported last week citing people it didn’t identify. Meanwhile, several government-controlled banks reported losses last quarter as bad loans surged. The Finance Ministry’s spokesman didn’t reply to a phone call seeking comment.While the government used to directly appoint CEOs of state banks, triggering accusations of cronyism, in 2016 it created a Bank Board Bureau to independently handle top recruitment. When naming the new head of the bureau in April, the government pledged its commitment “not to interfere” in senior level appointments. CEOs are typically selected from among their peers for a term of three years.“These banks, devoid of CEOs, don’t have adequate capital or an appetite to lend,” said Siddharth Purohit, a Mumbai-based analyst at SMC Global Securities Ltd. “To attract the right kind of talent to these positions may be tough in the current environment.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/just-when-they-need-leaders-state-owned-banks-are-headless/articleshow/64492207.cms

It was in January 2014 that RBI had last raised the short-term lending rate (repo) to 8 per cent; since then it has either reduced it or maintained status quo.The current repo rate stands at 6 per cent.""We pencil in 50 bps of rate hike in 2018-19 (earlier pause) possibly split between August and October.""But we do believe that the MPC votes are likely to be evenly balanced in the June meeting thereby keeping the chances of a rate hike alive in June,"" said domestic brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities.The 7-quarter high GDP growth rate of 7.7 per cent during the January-March period of 2017-18 and forecast of a normal monsoon have reduced the clamour for a cut in the benchmark lending rate.Retail inflation, a key data for RBI, has remained above 4 per cent since November 2017. Besides, oil prices have been rising for the past few months. While petrol in Delhi costs Rs 77.83 a litre, diesel is at Rs 68.88 per litre.""Notwithstanding the clamour for a rate hike in market, we believe ground realities call for caution and not rate action,"" said India's largest lender SBI in its research 'Ecowrap'.Radhika Rao, India Economist with DBS Group, expects hike in the short-term lending rate in June itself.""We expect the Monetary Policy committee to sound hawkish, with a rising probability that they will vote for a pre-emptive 25 bp rate hike in June, to maintain financial stability and contain second-round inflationary impact from higher oil prices and a weaker rupee,"" she said.Indicating hardening of the interest rate scenario, several major lenders including SBI, PNB and ICICI Bank have already raised their lending rates from June 1.

The government has mandated the RBI to restrict the retail inflation at 4 per cent (with a margin of +/- 2 per cent), while supporting growth.The RBI has refrained from revising the repo rate since August 2017 citing inflationary concerns.Indicating hardening of the interest rate scenario, several major lenders including SBI, PNB and ICICI Bank have already raised their lending rates from June 1. Some of the banks have also increased the deposit rates.""Notwithstanding the clamour for a rate hike in market, we believe ground realities call for caution and not rate action,"" India's largest lender SBI said in a research report.One of the reasons it cited was that while the GDP numbers are strong, private consumption continues to lose pace, dropping to 6.6 per cent in 2017-18 from 7.3 per cent in the previous year.The MPC, headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel, will for the first time meet for three days as against the usual two.The resolution of the second bi-monthly monetary policy meeting for the current fiscal will be announced in the afternoon of June 6.In the last MPC meet, held in April, RBI Deputy Governor and member of the panel Viral Acharya had indicated that he would vote for withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the June policy.Another member Michael Patra had voted for a hike in repo rate but was overruled by majority that opted for status-quo.Currently, repo rate -- the short-term lending rate at which RBI lends to banks -- stands at 6 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate is 5.75 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate stand at 6.25 per cent.Naresh Takkar, MD and Group CEO of ICRA Ltd said: ""Although the headline and the core CPI inflation for April 2018 revealed negative surprises, an immediate rate hike may be premature, given the lack of clarity on factors like the 2018 monsoon, the minimum support price (MSPs) and fiscal risks.""However, the expected rebound in the average CPI inflation for 2018-19, in conjunction with the higher-than-anticipated GDP expansion in Q4 of last fiscal, suggests that a back-ended rate hike cannot be ruled out, which is likely to be reflected in the tone of the policy document, he added.Reversing the declining trend of three months, retail inflation inched up to 4.58 per cent in April.The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation too rose to 3.18 per cent in April mainly on account of a spike in fuel prices, as per data released by the government.

State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank, Union Bank and Punjab National Bank (PNB) are among those who have hiked rates. The MPC will announce its decision on June 6. The marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) is reviewed every month by banks and reflects their cost of funds. Following the latest hike, SBI’s one-year MCLR stands at 8.25 per cent versus 8.15 per cent earlier. This is the second rate hike by the bank in 2018. While HDFC has increased its retail prime lending rate (PLR) — its benchmark for home loans — by 10bps,  ICICI Bank also hiked its one-year MCLR  by 10bps to 8.40 per cent. Following this, HDFC’s home loans will start at 8.5 per cent. The new rates come into effect from June 2, 2018 and is due to increase in cost of wholesale funds.  PNB has hiked one-year MCLR to 8.4 per cent from 8.3 per cent earlier. Union Bank increased rates by 10bps to 8.45 per cent. But Kotak Bank has increased its one-year MCLR by a sharp 20bps to 8.9 per cent.  64422012 Banks have not been waiting for the RBI decision and have moved ahead with an increase in deposit rates. On Friday, the third largest private lender Axis Bank hiked rates on deposits — by introducing a new tenure of 12 months, 5 days to under 12 months, 11 days — to 7.4 per cent.Another private lender, Mangaluru-based Karnataka Bank, raised rates to 7.25 per cent from 7.10 per cent on deposits for a period of 1 year to 2 years. Earlier this week, SBI hiked term deposit rates for amounts of less than Rs 1 crore by up to 25bps.Banks have been increasing deposit rates as loan growth has picked up and deposit growth has been slowing down with continued remonetisation and savings moving into mutual funds. The increase in deposit rates will automatically translate into higher lending rates in coming weeks as the MCLR is computed by taking into account the cost of deposits.Read this story in Bengali ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-hike-loan-rates-days-before-rbis-policy-meet/articleshow/64421653.cms

A senior employee of a diamond trading firm who aided his employer in fabricating property documents to secure an overdraft facility of Rs one crore and duped Punjab National Bank has been arrested by Mumbai police. The banking unit of the Economic Offences Wing(EOW) on Wednesday arrested Yogesh Pujwani (59), a diamond assorter responsible for evaluating the quality of precious stones; they are now looking for his employer Amit Bipin Shah. The complainant in the case is Divakar Prasad, a senior official from the asset recovery branch of the bank at Dalamal House at Nariman point. Prasad in his complaint has alleged that ASR Diamonds' proprietor Shah had in 2008 applied for an overdraft facility by way of a mortgage with PNB's Opera House branch. Shah had submitted documents to an upmarket flat at Geeta Smruti housing society at Gamdevi. ""Shah submitted the share certificate, registration agreement, and NOC from the soceity. The bank sent those documents for legal scrutiny and it gave a clearance,"" said an officer.Shah availed of the overdraft facility until 2009 when he began to default on his repayments. Shah's loan turned a non performing asset for the bank. In 2010 the bank wrote to Shah and when he failed to respond, it issued a notice warning it would attach his flat. However, when PNB officials visited the flat, they found a family had been living there for two decades and they had never sold their flat to Amit Shah. The flat owner informed the PNB official that Shah had similarly duped ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance and Citi Finance using the same documents; officials from these banks too had turned up to take the possession of the flat. PNB officials then lodged a complaint with the DB Marg police. The case was transferred to EOW.
