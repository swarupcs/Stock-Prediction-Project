Although the bank is yet to finalize the pricing of the bonds, merchant bankers are speculating of a yield in the region of 9.5-10%.SBI's previous Rs 1000-crore bond issue in October 2010 was oversubscribed 20 times because of the attractive yields the bank had offered on its bonds. The bank had offered investors the choice of 9.25% on a 10-year bond and 9.5% on a 15-year bond. There was also a step up option whereby the bank would pay half a percentage point more if it did not exercise its call option at the end of 10 years.The main attraction of the bond, besides its pricing, is the liquidity. Since the securities are listed in the stock exchange they can be immediately traded after allotment. With the bond price jumping up 5% on listing, some investors managed to sell their bonds for a decent profit. Despite the increase in interest rates since the issue, the earlier bonds continue to trade at a premium. The 10-year bond with a face value of Rs 10,000 is currently traded at Rs 10,265 while the 15-year bond is trading at Rs 10,495.Senior officials at SBI said that neither the pricing nor the tenure of the bonds has been finalized and the board would approve the final issue. At the time of the October issue, fixed deposits yielded less than 9%. Since then there have been two rounds of deposit rate hikes by banks. The first round took place around end-December while the second round is currently taking place following the 25 basis point rate hike by Reserve Bank of India on January 25.

While the total claims have been estimated at Rs 26,259 crore, those who booked flats, plots and villas had principal and interest due of Rs 16,373. IDBI Bank, with claims of Rs 4,334 crore, has the next highest vote share (16.5%), followed by IIFCL (3.9%) and SBI (2.9%).A majority say, however, does not mean that homebuyers will be able to push through decisions that completely protect their interest. For a resolution to go through, 66% of the votes have to vote for it. And, it has to be an affirmative vote — which means that those who don’t vote will be treated as negative voters.Insolvency experts said that getting unanimity among homebuyers is a tough task given that they are split into several groups. “There are some who want the apartments that they had booked while there are others who are seeking a refund,” said a buyer.Of the over 28,000 real estate unit holders, 24,300 are active allottees, while another 3,300 have been offered possession. There are 471 whose units have been cancelled and refunds are pending, Jain said in a letter to NCLT.

The one-year MCLR comes down to 7.85% per annum from 7.90% with effect from February 10. This is the ninth consecutive cut in MCLR in FY20.  74017359 The rate revision is on account of a reduction in the cost of funds before the policy. “The impact of the recent RBI policy measures and reduction in deposit rates will be reflected in the next review of MCLR,” the bank said in a statement. The one-year MCLR is the benchmark used by SBI for loans before October 2019 and non-retail loans. New borrowers get their loans at rates linked to the repo rate. The MCLR reduction would mean that older customers stand to benefit.The bank also reduced its deposit rates by 10-50 bps citing surplus liquidity in the system. This lowered interest rate on retail term deposits (less than Rs 2 crore) and bulk term deposits (Rs 2 crore and above) with effect from February 10.

The market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies also took a hit, eroding by Rs 8,50,820.81 crore to reach Rs 3,65,97,915.97 crore, according to a PTI report. This is a significant decrease from the market capitalisation of Rs 3,74,48,736.78 crore on January 20.According to Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the decline in the benchmark index can be attributed to a massive sell-off and profit booking. The domestic equities started positively but soon turned red due to weak global cues and a mixed set of earnings released so far. 107068208Additionally, South Asian economies, including India, may face significant risks due to rising hostilities in the Red Sea and the prolonged disruptions caused by Houthi attacks. The Bank of Japan has also decided to keep interest rates unchanged, following China's lead.Investors are now eagerly awaiting the release of US GDP data and the European Central Bank rate decision. However, this week will be a truncated week with just three trading days for Indian stock markets. Given the weak global cues and the mixed set of earnings, it is expected that the market will consolidate and may experience a further drop until fresh positive triggers emerge, Khemka was quoted as saying.Among the Sensex firms, IndusInd Bank suffered the biggest loss, falling by 6.13%, followed by SBI (3.99%), Hindustan Unilever (3.82%), Axis Bank (3.41%), and HDFC Bank (3.23%). 107065034The midcap and smallcap indices witnessed more decline compared to the benchmarks, with the S&P BSE MidCap falling by 2.95% and the midcap index settling 2.79% lower. Most sectoral indices, except healthcare, ended with losses. Realty and services indices recorded the highest decline of 5.46% and 4.06%, respectively. Metal, oil & gas, and energy sectors also experienced significant drops. On the positive side, the healthcare index rose by 1.02%.In terms of stock performance, 2,991 stocks declined, while 938 advanced and 138 remained unchanged.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bse-sensex-plunges-stock-market-crash-leaves-investors-poorer-by-rs-8-50-lakh-crore/articleshow/107087927.cms

In case the bank is not able to achieve a resolution and the borrower goes into liquidation, the bank will have to provide for the entire loan amount out of its profits.Following Tuesday’s trades, the BSE Bankex has lost all the gains it had made in the last month. PSU banks had rallied immediately after the government said that the RBI would come out with a mechanism for resolving bad loans. Most banks had expected that they would be given some relief in making provisions, allowing them to spread these over the next fiscal. However, the RBI’s new norms require that banks provide for loan losses in FY18 itself.Shares of Syndicate Bank and Punjab National Bank fell nearly 5%, Canara Bank (4.5%), Andhra Bank 4%, Allahabad Bank 3.9%, Bank of Baroda (3.6%), SBI (3.3%), Union Bank of India and Bank of Maharashtra (2.8%) and Axis Bank (2.3%) on the BSE.“The RBI’s guideline to maintain higher provision against loans under the insolvency process has impacted the market direction and plunged it to test the support level of 9,500 (Nifty).

A proposal to amend Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act through the ordinance route was approved by the Cabinet yesterday. The amendment to the Banking Regulation Act will empower the RBI to issue direction to banks to recover non-performing assets (NPAs) from loan defaulters. After the Cabinet meeting yesterday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government took some important decisions in respect of the banking sector. Public sector banks (PSBs) are saddled with NPAs or bad loans to the tune of a staggering Rs 6 lakh crore.

SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya said any rate cut by the bank would depend on a lot many factors including credit growth and she does not see any room for any cut in the near future.  READ ALSO  SBI, 3 other banks cut lending rate; EMIs to come down  SBI cuts home loan rate by .25% for new borrowers  This came soon after the Reserve Bank kept its policy rates unchanged, with Governor Raghuram Rajan saying that the headline inflation is at elevated levels and banks are yet to pass on the full benefits of previous rate cuts.  RBI has cut the rates thrice so far in 2015 by 25 basis points each.  Rajan, who has used strong words against banks for holding on to rates in the April and June, today said banks have only cut 0.30 per cent at the median level as against the RBI s cut of 0.75 per cent this year.  Commenting on this, Bhattacharya defended SBI's position and said that the bank had raised the rates by 30 basis points only when RBI had hiked the policy rate by 75 basis points, and the reduction in the bank's rate has also been 30 basis points when the central bank has cut the policy rate by 75 basis points.  She, however, added that RBI's action has been on expected line and it was good that the central bank has retained a dovish stand.

Both benchmark indices were driven strong gains mainly in metal, banking, IT and infra shares amid earnings optimism.

While banks have tweaked rates differently, the net effect is that depositors lose more than the gains accruing to borrowers resulting in widening of the banks' margins.  Country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) slashed interest rates upto one per cent on fixed deposits of all but one maturity. With these changes, the peak rate on SBI fixed deposits would come down to 9 per cent per annum, from tomorrow.  On the other hand, it has reduced interest rates marginally by about 0.25 per cent, that too only on car loans. SBI Chairman Pratip Chaudhuri said that the bank may not go in for cut in the minimum (base) lending rate. ""Our base rate is already one of the lowest in the industry,"" he told CNBC TV18.  Other banks, including Allahabad Bank, United Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank have reduced the base rate by upto 0.25 per cent. SBI's base rate stands at 10 per cent. It is the benchmark rate below which a bank cannot lend. Lakshmi Vilas Bank reduced its FD rates on select maturities by 0.25 per cent.  Following the RBI's decision to cut key interest rate by 0.5 per cent to 8 per cent in its annual credit policy ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank and Punjab National Bank have already announced reduction in both lending and deposit rates.

The Reserve Bank Friday unexpectedly maintained status quo on the benchmark interest rate but warned that rising oil prices and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to growth and inflation.

The brand value of Tata group has risen by $3 billion in the past one year, primarily led by its international diversification strategy and the flagship firm TCS, as per consulting firm Brand Finance India's annual study.  ""Despite the fact that some divisions within the group have been underperforming, the brand should benefit from the recently outlined plans to invest$35 billion over the next three years and should go some way towards meeting the goal of the Tata chairman, Cyrus Mistry to be amongst the 25 most admired brands globally,"" it said.  Brand value has increased among the top 50 by 10 per cent compared to 2013 with brands such as Tata, Godrej, HCL, and L&T leading the way, said the Brand Finance India 100 list that was released on Thursday.  Banking firms fared the worst collectively with majority of brands losing value or remaining stagnant due to generally poor governance and weak credit controls especially at the government-owned institutions, Brand Finance said.  State Bank of India has seen its value drop by ($1.9 billion) as poorer revenue forecasts and bad-loans dampened earnings, it said.  HCL Technologies has seen an increase in brand value of 51 per cent by$649 million as its successful strategy has seen the brand win 50 transformational engagements with contract values of$5 billion in the past year distributed across all service lines and geographies.  ""Indian brands have benefitted from the rapid economic growth seen over the past ten years,"" said Brand Finance's Savio D'Souza.  ""Indian brands must take advantage of the improving business sentiment and invest in brand related activities like customer engagement, sponsorships, employee satisfaction and brand tracking to drive the next phase of growth in order for more Indian companies to join the global club of internationally recognised brands,"" he added.  The average brand value to enterprise value (BV/EV) for India's top 100 brands is 12 per cent. However, some of the largest PSUs have an average ratio of 3 per cent. The BV/EV ratio shows the proportion of a company's value accounted for by the brand.

The 30-share index commenced the day's trade weaker by a whopping 368 points from its previous close at 19,665.57. It, however, trimmed some of the losses during the day and closed lower by 183.25 points, or 0.91 per cent, at 19,851.23.  Similarly, the wide-based National Stock Exchange index Nifty lost 75.55 points, or 1.25 per cent, to close at 5,955.25. Also, SX40 index, the flagship index of MCX-SX, closed 85.33 points, or 0.71 per cent lower at 11,854.7.  Brokers said the trading sentiment, mainly in banking and financial sector stocks, was dampened after RBI announced a slew of measures to curb rupee's volatility late last night, including hiking the lending rates for banks and sucking up of Rs 12,000 crore, to make the currency dearer.  This also raised concerns of RBI increasing interest rates in its first quarter monetary policy review later this month, they said, adding that a weakening trend in the overseas markets as German investor confidence unexpectedly dropped, also hit the trading sentiment.  Meanwhile, rupee appreciated by a hefty 68 paise to 59.21 against the dollar intraday today.  Out of the 30 Sensex components, 17 stocks ended in the red led by country's largest private sector lender ICICI Bank tanking 5.61 per cent to Rs 1,003.20, followed by country's largest lender SBI (4.57 per cent) and mortgage major HDFC (3.88 per cent).

The buying activity was mainly in FMCG, Refinery and IT sectors amid government's decision to liberalise foreign direct investment norms in some sectors coupled with good corporate results.  Good Q1 results from Infosys, TCS and HDFC Bank further boosted the market sentiment. Positive global cues and good rainfall also aided the firm trend.  At the beginning of the week, sensex resumed lower at 19,926.10 and dropped further to a low of 19,649.58 on heavy selling as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took various steps to tighten liquidity in a bid to curb rupee volatility.  Meanwhile, inflation based on the wholesale price index accelerated to 4.86 per cent in June from 4.7 per cent in May, according to government data.  Banking stocks fell sharply as the RBI fined 22 banks for violating KYC/anti-money laundering norms. The Reserve Bank's latest measures would spark an interest rate increase, besides making it costlier for lenders and financial companies to raise short-term funds.

It has also hardened by 361.55 points or 6.38 per cent in last four weeks.  Finance minister P Chidambaram said measures by the apex bank have nothing to do with the upcoming monetary policy review and may not impact interest rates of banks.  Hindustan Unilever (HUL) was the top gainer in the sensex pack as it surged by 14.17 per cent on reports that the company has raised prices of several personal care products.  Tata Consultancy Services was the second top gainer, climbing 8.45 per cent after it posted a better-than-expected 15.5 per cent increase in consolidated net profit for the first quarter.

However, marketmen termed the move as hawkish and said it would cripple credit flow to the sector. Bonanza Portfolio Assistant Vice President Avinash Gupta said, ""RBI hiked SLR and made availability of funds more expensive for certain sectors. The feeling that inflation is weighing on minds of policy makers unnerved investors. Global cues were also negative.""

sbi,2024-01-14T04:46:00+05:30,Mayur Shetty,Record low spreads on SBI bonds open doors for other issuers: Bank of America,India Business News: Mumbai: : SBI's offshore fundraising through bonds at exceptionally narrow spreads over the interest rates the US government incurs on its borrowings .,"Mumbai: : SBI's offshore fundraising through bonds at exceptionally narrow spreads over the interest rates the US government incurs on its borrowings has paved the way for other Indian issuers, according to Bank of America. Last week SBI raised $600mn issuing bonds at a spread of 117 basis points over five-year US treasuries.In the past two decades, SBI rarely borrowed at less than 120 basis points above the US treasury rates. Of late Indian issuers avoided the offshore market due to increased borrowing costs caused by rising US interest rates, which peaked at over 5% in November. Additionally, withholding tax implications, effective since last year, added to the expense of offshore borrowing for Indian issuers.However, the tightening spreads present an opportunity for banks and corporations with overseas presence. ""Indian borrowers are well-positioned to benefit from the abundant liquidity in the offshore capital markets as Indian credit is very well regarded and well-followed,"" said Bhavik Pandya, Head of South & Southeast Asia Debt Capital Markets, Bank of America. The reason why Indian borrowers are finding favour is that large corporates have stronger balance sheets, uptrending growth and business interests spanning across countries along with robust controls and governance. ""The global investor community is interested in being a part of this India growth story. Although some withholding tax changes have made offshore borrowing slightly more expensive for Indian borrowers, the credit spreads remain compressed and combined with the deep liquidity of the offshore markets, foreign currency borrowing remains attractive for issuers looking for larger size borrowings, longer tenors and investor diversification,"" said Pandya.According to Pandya, the response to SBI's 5-year $600m bond offering indicates how investors see India's credit more favourably. ""Within APAC, as during the same period, we had some APAC names access the market for similar offerings, which were priced at much wider spreads. With SBI having opened up the markets in 2024, we expect other Indian issuers to follow up with issuances,"" he said.While there haven't been significant 2008-style large overseas acquisitions, many Indian corporations have established substantial operations abroad. Also the active equity/IPO pipeline and strong performance in India's equity markets are contributing a bullish outlook in alternative asset management, including private credit and equity..The fact that India is in focus among global money managers is reflected in the fact that in the past 12-18 months, major private equity firms have promoted their South Asia or Indian heads to lead APAC. The other reason why investors are keen on India is that Asian sovereign bond issuances are down, leading to emerging market investors looking for opportunities. Emerging Asian economies have reduced global borrowing. For example, Indonesia borrowed only 50-60% of their usual amount in the past five years. Several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, exhibit economic strength, resulting in reduced reliance on foreign borrowing.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/record-low-spreads-on-sbi-bonds-open-doors-for-other-issuers-bank-of-america/articleshow/106836567.cms

They have changed it now...to 8.1 per cent,"" the finance minister said.The minister further said that it is a decision taken by the EPFO Central Board which has a wide spectrum of representatives in it.The rate was 8.5 per cent for 2020-21. The EPFO earlier this month, decided to lower the interest rate to a four-decade low of 8.1 per cent for 2021-22.Sitharaman cited the comparative prevailing interest rates of other schemes saying Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana offers 7.6 per cent, Senior Citizen saving scheme (7.4 per cent) and PPF (7.1 per cent), while SBI's 5-10 year fixed deposits attract 5.50 per cent interest rates.""With all this, the EPFO has taken a call to give 8.1 per cent (interest rate),"" she said.She added that for 40 years the EPFO rates have not been brought down.""Yes, 40 years. There are today's realities which do keep us in the context of decisions taken by the Central Board of EPFO. It is yet to come to finance ministry for approval, but the fact remains that these are the rates that are prevailing today and it (EPFO) is still higher than the rest of them,"" she said.Later, the House returned a money bill moved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, authorising the government for payment and appropriation of certain sums from the Consolidated Fund for the financial year 2021-22.The Upper House of Parliament also returned another Appropriation Bill for the expenditure done in the 2018-19 financial year.Both the Appropriation Bills were passed by the Lok Sabha earlier.Sitharaman referred to pre-IPO valuation of LIC and said that the embedded value of the insurance behemoth was calculated in an ""extremely scientific way"" and was disclosed in draft IPO papers filed with Sebi.The eligible policy holders of LIC will have 10 per cent reservation, and may get a discount on offer price, she said.On excess spending approval being sought, she said that the government has borne higher cost of urea, and not passed it on to farmers.She mentioned that devolution of state share in central taxes is projected at Rs 8.17 lakh crore in FY23, and the revised estimate of Rs 7.45 lakh crore for FY22 has already been released.She further said that Rs 5,000 crore is proposed for recapitalisation of state insurance companies in third batch of supplementary demands for grants.

The surge helped the sensex regain the 33k mark, while the Nifty closed above 10k again. The day’s session started with the sensex opening in negative territory after a 400-point fall in the Dow Jones index on Friday night. But the BSE index gained through the session to close near the day’s high of 33,115. Monday’s gains were generated despite a Rs 741-crore net selling by foreign funds, while domestic funds recorded a net inflow of Rs 2,018 crore. The day’s session added about Rs 1.5 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at nearly Rs 146 lakh crore.The surge in the sensex came on the back of analysts’ opinions that pointed towards only limited damage to the global economy due to US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose $60 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods and a retaliatory $3 billion worth of tariffs imposed on US goods coming into China. In a note titled ‘More Smoke, Less Fire’, IIFL’s Hitesh Jain noted, “The shock value of Trump’s tactics notwithstanding, the actual blow to Chinese economy would be circumscribed in our reckoning, given that Chinese exports to the US contribute only 3% to the Chinese GDP. Select US tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese imports is a meagre 0.25% of China’s GDP, comprising less than 0.5% of world trade. “Likewise, US exports to China is less than 1% of America’s GDP and only 8% of total exports. As US tariffs would cover select Chinese imports, the ensuing rise in US inflation would be minimal and transient in nature.”Analysts said fears of a full-blown trade war were mitigated after the US president diluted his initial stance to a large extent and excluded Canada and Mexico from the list of countries.Although the day’s gains were across the board, stocks of companies from banking & finance, consumer durables and metal sectors led the rally. On BSE, banking & finance and metal indices closed 2.3% up, while the consumer durables index closed 2.2% higher. Most IT and oil & gas stocks closed in the red.Among the 30 sensex stocks, 26 advanced with Yes Bank ending 5.7% higher, SBI 5% up and HDFC Bank 2.9% higher.

The Sensex resumed higher at 19,977.38 after Sebi eased investment norms for overseas entities in government debt, but weighed down as inflation soared to a six-month high and closed nearly flat on Monday.  Inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index, came in at 6.1 per cent in August compared with 5.79 per cent in July, the highest level since February.  The sensex rallied to almost 3-year high to 20,739.69 on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve unexpectedly left its stimulus programme unchanged, easing fears of capital outflows.  The decision may attract investments in most emerging markets, including India, this year. However, the Sensex fell on profit-booking from operators on the last day of the week to end sharply higher by 530.95 points or 2.69 per cent at 20,263.71 from 19,732.76 last weekend after RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday unexpectedly raised a key interest rate to combat inflation and partially rolled back liquidity tightening measures.  The RBI raised the short-term policy repo rate to 7.5 per cent from 7.25 per cent, saying inflation had to be lowered to more tolerable levels. The move may increase interest rates on home and auto loans.  To ease liquidity, the marginal standing facility rate, at which banks borrow from the RBI, was cut to 9.5 per cent from 10.25 per cent and the minimum daily maintenance of the cash reserve ratio was lowered to 95 per cent.  The sensex has gained by 1,744.27 points of 9.42 per cent during the four weeks. The NSE 50-share Nifty also rose by 161.50 points or 2.76 per cent to 6,012.10 from last weekend's close of 5,850.60.

It says our economic problems are 'imported'. This is a smoke screen. The government is singularly responsible since all our economic indicators were floundering even before global events laid siege,"" Avijit said.""One must remember that even the 8.7 per cent growth last financial year was due to the very low base. India's GDP had contracted to -6.6 per cent in the pandemic year 2020-21, and India was one of the worst performers among all emerging economies,"" he claimed.This cut comes on the back of another downward revision of the GDP by the Reserve Bank of India last week, from 7.2 per cent to 7 per cent, he said.The RBI governor has warned of extreme volatility and the need to anchor inflation expectations, he pointed out.""The headline interest rate, the repo rate, was also increased by 50 bps to 5.9 per cent in another desperate bid to control price rice. From May this year, the repo rate has increased by 1.9 per cent,"" Avijit said.One should not be surprised if there is another cut in GDP estimates after the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting two months from now, and the trend continues, he said.""The mismatch between a high GDP estimate and the state of the real economy - lack of jobs and output - would be hard to explain,"" he said.Over the past three years, the GDP in India has grown just over 3 per cent and less than 4 per cent since the last quarter before the pandemic, Avijit said.At such low levels of growth, India cannot create more jobs or take measures to alleviate poverty, he said.Similar GDP estimate cuts have been also done by other financial institutions and rating agencies for 2022-23.""The pessimism regarding future growth is evident - SBI: 6.8 per cent from 7.5 per cent; Fitch 7 per cent from 7.8 per cent; Moody's 7.7 from 8.8 per cent; Goldman Sachs: 7 per cent from 7.2 per cent,"" the Congress spokesperson said.""The lack of contribution by the informal sector is a primary reason for the decline in GDP. According to an SBI report, the informal sector's contribution to the GDP in 2017-18 was as much as 52 per cent. This has now plummeted to less than 20 per cent,"" he said.The weak government data on the informal sector means that speedy counteractive measures cannot be taken, he said.As many as 5,907 MSMEs have shut shop in the last two years indicating a high level of joblessness and distress, Avijit claimed.According to CMIE data, unemployment levels have consistently remained well above 8 per cent for the past two years, he said.The UNCTAD report said India experienced an expansion of 8.2 per cent in 2021, the strongest among G20 countries. As supply chain disruptions eased, rising domestic demand turned the current account surplus into a deficit and growth decelerated.On the Bharat Jodo Yatra, Avijit said it has been in Karnataka for three days and the response has been overwhelming.""We are moving steadily towards our goal of uniting India, bridging fault lines, and fighting injustice, economic and social. We march on, hail or shine.""Meanwhile, the Indian economy, one of the primary concerns of the Bharat Jodo Yatra, is confronting one bad news after another,"" he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-singularly-responsible-for-indias-economic-problems-congress/articleshow/94645979.cms

Thus, nearly half of the economy may perform normally or better than normal over the full 2020-21,"" it said.The government imposed nation-wide lockdown from March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus and it continued in various phases in June, albeit with a significant easing of restrictions since early May.Also, given the current geopolitical situation, the government at the central and state levels have become more active in attracting investment from abroad, the paper said adding that the reforms in the corporate tax rates in 2019-20 will also facilitate the relocation of various production platforms to India.""Thus, a small positive growth may not be ruled out,"" the paper said.India's economy has suffered its worst slump on record in April-June quarter of 2020-21, with the gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by 23.9 per cent as the coronavirus-related lockdowns weighed on the already-declining consumer demand and investment.This is the sharpest contraction since quarterly figures started being published in 1996 and worse than what was expected by most analysts.The Indian economy was in a troubled state when the pandemic hit the world. Before COVID-19 crisis hit India, the economy was already decelerating, real GDP growth had moderated from 7.0 per cent in 2017-18 to 6.1 per cent in 2018-19 and 4.2 per cent in 2019-20.Noting that the lockdown has put a brake on the economy, the paper suggested that the need to kick start the economy and move it forward has become urgent.""Maintenance of government expenditure at a high level is unavoidable and monetisation of debt is also unavoidable.""But policymakers must also be conscious of the fact that there is a limit to monetisation.Wisdom lies in striking the appropriate balance,"" it said.Monetisation of deficit happens when the RBI directly buys government securities from the primary market and in turn prints more money thereby helping it to bridge the fiscal deficit.The paper said that even as India takes steps to kick start the economy, the country must consider the shape of the next round of reforms which would pave the way for sustained growth in post-Covid era.""Recapitalization of banks and regulation of bad debt must get priority. The reform measures announced recently by the government such as private operations in coal mining are truly in the spirit of liberalisation.""They need to be implemented with dedication and commitment,"" it said.

The brand now claims 34 per cent share of market revenue in the telecom sector.Despite the troubles plaguing them, banking brands did see solid growth in the year with 14 of them in the ranking list, with a cumulative brand value of $24.9 billion, recording an average brand value growth of 25 per cent.State Bank of India (up 8 per cent to $6.4 billion) and HDFC Bank (up 22 per cent to $5.9 billion) have retained their positions in the top 10, with the latter climbing one spot to sixth in the ranking following a healthy 24 per cent growth over the previous year.But following the pandemic, banks are set to lose at least 20 per cent of their value.Brand value is the net economic benefit that a brand owner would achieve by licensing the brand in the open market.

Central Bank of India had 7.67 per cent stake in IL&FS at the end of March 2018.  The bank is already saddled with huge non-performing assets and it has been dependent on capital support from the government, sources said.  To meet regulatory capital norms, the government infused Rs 323 crore capital in the bank in the last fiscal. Besides, it is expected to get more during the current fiscal.  Central Bank of India would have to shell out Rs 345 crore to maintain 7.67 per cent stake in IL&FS.  IL&FS group is facing serious liquidity crisis and has defaulted on interest payment on various debt repayments since August 27. It has over Rs 91,000 crore in debt at the consolidated level. The company needs an immediate capital infusion of Rs 3,000 crore and is planning a Rs 4,500-crore rights issue.  Financials of Central Bank of India are also not up to the par. For the first quarter ended June, 2018, the net loss widened by 74 per cent to Rs 1,522.54 crore due to a more than two-fold spike in provisions for bad loans. It had posted losses of Rs 5,105 crore for 2017-18.  LIC is the largest shareholder in IL&FS with 25.34 per cent stake. Besides, Japan's Orix Corporation has 23.54 per cent stake in the company. Other shareholders include Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (12.5 per cent stake), IL&FS Employees Welfare Trust (12 per cent), HDFC (9.02 per cent) and SBI (6.42 per cent).

According to reports, IL&FS is in talks with the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) to sell roads and renewable energy projects.

The annual general meeting is going to take place on Saturday and more details would emerge after it, Sharma said in the national capital.  The LIC chief expressed confidence that over Rs 60,000 crore worth assets can be recovered by IL&FS while trying to work out solution for the remaining Rs 30,000 crore.  IL&FS, where LIC is the largest shareholder with 25.34 per cent stake, has a debt burden of over Rs 90,000 crore.  Japan's Orix Corporation has 23.54 per cent stake in the company. Other shareholders include Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (12.5 per cent stake), IL&FS Employees Welfare Trust (12 per cent), HDFC (9.02 per cent), Central Bank of India (7.67 per cent) and SBI (6.42 per cent). These are the shareholding figures at the end of March.  Earlier this week, IL&FS Financial Services defaulted on interest payment and fixed deposits. This was fourth in the series of defaults by the group entity.  On Friday, LIC Mutual Fund said that IL&FS Securities Services has cleared its dues worth Rs 300 crore.  IL&FS -- credited for building the longest tunnel in the country (Chenani-Nashri tunnel in J&K) -- is sitting on a debt pile of over Rs 90,000 crore.

US-based Lone Star, which has in the past attempted joint ventures with IL&FS, is expected to buy out three-four road projects with an estimated value of around Rs 6,500 crore, or nearly $1 billion, people directly aware of the matter said.The deal would be struck through debt assumption, whereby the acquirer agrees to refinance the original debt, thus relieving the stress on IL&FS’ balance sheet proportionally. IL&FS Transportation Networks (ITNL) has about 28 build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, most of which are operational, with an estimated value of more than Rs 25,000 crore, or about $4 billion.IL&FS has appointed consulting firms and valuation experts to advise on unbundling the debt pile-up.Recent media reports said India’s sovereign wealth manager National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) was in talks to acquire the road and power assets of IL&FS. The discussion with NIIF is ongoing and could see it snap up a different set of road and power assets from the troubled conglomerate. “The discussion with Lone Star is more advanced and is awaiting formal approvals,” said one of the sources mentioned earlier in the report.Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Lone Star is known for buying out distressed assets globally. It has struck deals worth $180 billion in operating companies, real estate, equity, credit and other financial assets in the last two decades. IL&FS and subsidiary ITNL are attempting to raise capital through a twin rights issue. On July 27, the board of IL&FS Transportation — the road development arm of IL&FS — approved raising Rs 3,000 crore by way of a rights issue. This came close on the heels of parent IL&FS approving a Rs 4,500-crore rights issue. However, some shareholders have called for the funds to be raised in a phased manner. Also, one of the promoters Central Bank of India is not in a position to invest.IL&FS was promoted by the Central Bank of India, HDFC and Unit Trust of India (now Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India, or SUUTI). Over the years, its shareholding has broadened to include Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and ORIX Corporation (Japan), as the largest shareholders in IL&FS, with their stakeholding at 25.34% and 23.54% respectively. Other prominent shareholders include Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA, 12.56% stake), HDFC (9.02%), Central Bank (7.67%) and SBI (6.42%).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lone-star-eyes-debt-hit-ilfs-road-assets/articleshow/65345765.cms

The financial services conglomerate, with around Rs 1-lakh-crore public debt, is gasping for liquidity after failing to meet certain repayment obligations and triggering fears of loan recalls.The emergency meeting is expected to convey the intensifying crisis at IL&FS to all the main shareholders and also possibly expedite a proposed Rs 4,500-crore rights issue, which is scheduled for early November. On the positive side, all prominent shareholders — LIC, Orix of Japan, SBI, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and HDFC — have agreed in principle to participate in the rights issue.The latest activity follows a group company, IL&FS Financial Services, failing to meet repayment obligations through a commercial paper borrowing last month. This has resulted in the RBI barring the company from raising short-term funds through this route until 2019. The technical default has promoted other lenders to check on their loans over fears of default. “IL&FS is seeking a Rs 3,000-4,000 crore loan to stall a deepening crisis, which carries crucial ramifications in sectors like infrastructure and the broader economy,” sources said. IL&FS will inform shareholders that the funding will be secured as it has claims of Rs 8,000 crore from various state governments for road projects. These payments are stuck over dispute on the actual amount, but nearly 80% of the claims are acknowledged as a liability. It is also telling shareholders that it is changing its project structure to avoid disputes in future. IL&FS, however, declined to comment. IL&FS has also been in talks with three investors — Lone Star, ISquared Capital and National Infrastructure Investment Fund — to sell some of its road portfolios to pare debt. These negotiations have taken time as potential acquirers scrutinise investment returns on these assets. IL&FS Transportation Networks has 28 build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, most of which are operational.On the rights issue, the company is telling shareholders that they will be able to increase their stakes at a “very attractive” valuation by subscribing to a rights issue currently. LIC, the largest shareholder with 25.34% stake, is prepared to provide funds. However, insurance laws do not allow raising ownership and LIC risks increasing the stake if other shareholders do not invest.Among the other large investors is Orix Corporation of Japan (with 23.5%) — which is inclined to invest, while ADIA (12.6%), which has called for more information, is most likely committed to participating in the rights issue.Although SBI (6.4% stake) too has been liquidating its non-core assets, it is willing to put in more money. HDFC, one of the early promoters with a 9% stake, is also willing to invest but does not want to increase its stake. Among its investors, Central Bank of India, which holds a 7.7% stake, is unlikely to subscribe as it is facing capital pressures on its own.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/crisis-hit-ilfs-seeks-rs-3k-cr-loan/articleshow/65712290.cms

""I am trying to get a lot of technology to help my people so that they spend less of their time on activities that don't really need a lot of thinking and knowledge. For routine stuff such as cash counting we are bringing more and more machines,"" said SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, adding the bank should be able to manage with the number of people it planned to hire during 2014-15.  The bank plans to install cash deposit machines, which will reduce the use of teller counters manned by bank employees. It is also bringing in cash recyclers - where the ATM uses the deposited money for withdrawals. ""These machines (cash recyclers) can recognise fake notes and impound them and credit your account lesser by that amount. We will be bringing in around 4,500 cash recyclers,"" said Bhattacharya.  Although the entire banking industry in the country is facing a manpower shortage, the situation is particularly acute in state-owned banks where, according to an estimate by Mckinsey India, 75% of the top management or those above the assistant general manager grade are due to retire by 2020. ""In FY15, SBI is planning to recruit about 1,837 probationary officers and 5,400 assistant officers,"" J N Misra, SBI's deputy managing director and corporate development officer told ET on the sidelines of a conference held by SBICAP Securities last week.  In the previous fiscal, the SBI's 7,600 staff members retired while 35,000-40,000 are due to retire over the next four years. This will happen at a time when new private entities like Bandhan and IDFC, which have already got banking licences from the Reserve Bank of India, will seek to compete with the established banks and are likely to offer higher remunerations to draw talent.  The central bank also plans to issue differentiated bank licences like a standalone payment bank in months to come. That will further push up the demand for human resources and banks offering better salaries may corner the lion's share from the limited talent pool.  SBI's Misra, however, said the bank would not lose manpower to the new banks.  ""I don't think attrition rate will go up at SBI due to the emergence of two new banks,"" Misra said. SBI offers a salary of about Rs 70,000 per month to fresh graduates who join as probationers.  ""At SBI, the overall attrition rate is just at 2.3% while it is 6-7% for those new employees who are joining as probationary officers. I have interacted with new employees with two-three years of experience. They are happy with the exposure they are getting at SBI,"" he said.

The base rate regime — the new interest rate benchmark to which all the lending rates will be linked to from July 1,"MUMBAI: Home loan borrowers can rest easy. The base rate regime — the new interest rate benchmark to which all the lending rates will be linked to from July 1 — has not hiked mortgage rates. And indications are that home finance rates are unlikely to rise unless the RBI hikes interest rates to tame inflation.On Wednesday, SBI left its home and car loan rates unchanged at the prevailing levels for all the tenures till September 30, but said it could change mid-way through in case its base rate is changed. SBI will continue with its popular 8% per annum home loan rate and has also left the other terms for home loan customers unchanged. However, it said the floating rate component in the home loan, as also rates for car, educational and personal loans, will now be linked to SBI's base rate, that it fixed on Tuesday at 7.5%.Till late on Wednesday, HDFC and ICICI Bank, did not announce any change in their home loan structures. However, LIC Housing Finance said that for home loan borrowers preferring floating rates, the special offer rates for new customers for loans upto Rs 1.50 crore will be 8.75%, compared to the earlier situation where for loans above Rs 75 lakh and upto Rs 1.50 crore were priced at 9.75%. Under SBI's home loan scheme, often called the teaser rate, the bank offers home loans at 8% per annum for the first year and 9% for the second and the third years. After the end of the third year, the home loan customer moves to the prevailing interest rate at the time of such a shift. From the fourth year onwards, the rate will be linked to SBI's base rate, and the effective rate is 9.25% for loans upto Rs 50 lakh and 9.75% for loans above Rs 50 lakh.Car loans takers too will not see any change in rates. For new loans, the rate is 8% fixed for the first year, and 10% for the second and the third years. Thereafter, the rates are linked to base rate and the effective rate at present is 11.25% for the fourth and fifth years and 11.5% for the sixth and seventh for Ezee Car Loans with limits up to Rs 5 lakh. A host of leading banks announced their base rates on Wednesday, and as expected private sector banking major HDFC Bank set its rate lower than that of SBI. Compared to SBI's 7.5% per annum, HDFC Bank set its rate at 7.25%. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank kept it at 7.5%.

While Central Bank of India, another PSU bank, has followed SBI's footsteps and has launched a similar scheme, a number of mortgage lenders are going through the fine prints of the 8% scheme.While SBI's new offer, at 8%, indeed looks attractive but industry players pointed out a housing loan scheme should be seen over the tenure of the scheme. In this case, an SBI spokesperson clarified that after one year customers under this new scheme will move over to a rate as per its 'card' (prevailing) rate at the time of disbursement of the loan. So how does this offer work? On a comparative basis, at present, there is one home loan scheme from HDFC that offers 9.75% rate while another one from another private bank offers the same rate but only for loans of not more than Rs 5 lakh.Speaking to TOI, a spokesperson for HDFC said that on the face of it, an interest rate of 8% certainly looks to be an attractive proposition. ""But one needs to be fully aware that it is just for a year and the rate is much higher for subsequent years. Hence the exact arithmetic is important to be understood,"" the spokesperson said. ""The fact that interest rates on deposits are around the same levels and interest rates in general are higher is a sufficient indication even to a layman that he needs to understand the scheme fully,"" the HDFC official added.

Foreign institutional investors continued their buying spree and invested a net Rs 4,865.85 crore during the week, including the provisional figure of November 1.  Short-covering due to expiry of October contracts also gave a boost to the market.  Markets gained after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased the repo rate by 25 basis points on Tuesday, to curb inflation and also improved liquidity for banks, which was as per marketmen's expectations.  The sensex opened higher at 20,696.51 and shot up further to intra-day all-time high of 21,293.88 and also finished the week at a lifetime closing high at 21,196.31, showing a sharp gain of 513.29 points or 2.48 per cent.

The US Federal Reserve's decision this week to continue with its bond-buying stimulus programme eased concerns about foreign funds pulling out capital from emerging markets.  The market also got a boost when Union finance minister P Chidambaram said that the current account deficit is under control and the fiscal deficit target will be met.  The RBI increased the policy repo rate to 7.75 per cent and cut the marginal standing facility rate to 8.75 per cent, as was widely expected.

Forex: The rupee continued its downward march for the third week in a row and closed down by 28 paise at over two-week low of 61.74 against the greenback following month-end dollar demand from importers amid firm USD overseas.  However, strong local equities and continued capital inflows restricted the rupee fall to some extent, a forex dealer said. At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (forex) market, the local unit commenced better at 61.35 a dollar from previous weekend's close of 61.46 and moved in a range of 61.23 and 61.96 before settling the week at 61.74, exhibiting a fall of 28 paise or 0.46 pct.

The dollar showed recovery after the Federal Reserve decided to press on with USD 85 bln in monthly bond purchases, saying it needs to see more evidence that the economy will continue to improve.  Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Alpari Financial Services (India) said,""This week sensex hit a record high crossing its previous all-time high of Jan. 10, 2008, with the help of foreign inflows of around USD 3.5 billion since the US Federal Reserve unexpectedly delayed tapering of its monetary stimulus at a meeting on September 18.  The rupee is trading range bound for the last couple of months after having seen as much as 20 per cent fall to a record low in late August has been recovered mainly by foreign fund inflows into the stocks.  FIIs have bought USD 16.5 bln worth of shares so far this year. The trading range for the Spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 61.20 to 62.80.""  ""Recommended to be cautious and sell USDINR Futures on rise with the appropriate stop loss as rupee is expected to appreciate against dollar. Pivot Point for the Pair is at 61.92 and below is the Support and Resistance levels,"" he added.  ""Fiscal drag is also poised to diminish next year, from 1.5 percentage points (ppts) to 0.8ppts. Granted, the political climate remains a cause for concern, but even here we are seeing a glimpse of light.  The bottom line is that while the Fed is still waiting on evidence that the recovery will gain speed, this is likely to happen next year. When it does, the Fed will slowly begin unwinding asset purchases,"" he further commented. The benchmark six-month forward dollar premium payable in April closed the week at 241-243 paise. Far-forward contracts maturing in October ended at 457-459 paise.  The RBI fixed the reference rate for the US dollar at 61.9046 and for the euro at 83.8775 from 61.6250 and 85.1350 last weekend, respectively.

The bank has also said that such a borrowing will reduce bond yields, which will benefit both banks and the government.“It is expected that the government will go for $10 billion (around Rs 70,000 crore, or 10% of gross market borrowings) worth of sovereign bonds initially. This amount is merely 2.3% of India’s total current forex reserves and 29% of net FDI flows in FY19. This amount is also one-third of the minimum amount of sovereign debt issued in international markets,” a report by the country’s largest bank said.According to SBI chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh, going by international evidence, India is best placed to tap the sovereign bond market now. “Comparison with Latin American and Asian economies is imprudent and naive,” said Ghosh. He pointed out that such countries had an average 51% of debt denominated in foreign currencies/GDP at 124%, CAD/GDP at 6%, investment inflows at 9% and GDP growth at 5% just before the crisis. In contrast, India’s external debt/GDP is at 19.7%, sovereign foreign currency debt/GDP at 3.8% and investment inflows/GDP at 1.5%.Incidentally, SBI had fronted for the government by selling dollar-denominated bonds with guaranteed returns to non-residents twice under the previous NDA government. In 1998, the bank had raised over $4 billion through the issue of Resurgent India Bonds where the dollars were transferred to the RBI, which also bore the currency risk. In 2001, the bank again floated India Millennium Deposits to NRIs to beef up forex reserves and raised over $5.5 billion. Although the bonds were issued to NRIs, a large part of the funding for this investment came from foreign banks that lent to investors as the bonds had a quasi-sovereign backing. A third such fund-raising was done in 2013 by Indian banks through non-resident (FCNR-B) deposits, with the RBI providing protection against exchange rate risk for a total of $34 billion. In all three cases, the fund-raising was to stem the fall of the rupee. In 1997, it was following the Asian Currency Crisis, in 2001 it followed the dotcom bubble crash, and in 2013 after the Fed’s announcement of withdrawing liquidity led to ‘taper tantrums’ in emerging markets.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-10bn-sovereign-bonds-to-help-govt-banks/articleshow/70219322.cms

HTL, in which Himachal Futuristic Communications holds 74% stake, was deemed as a non-performing asset by SBI, post which the bank took possession of the land parcel in Guindy in Chennai.   Through this sale, SBI has recovered its dues of Rs 272 crore from HTL. The bank had set a floor price of Rs 250 crore for the land, and it was earlier expected to breach the Rs 400 crore mark in a competitive bidding war.

Back home, headline inflation, measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) dropped to 6.55 per cent in January, the lowest since December 2009 when it was 7.15 per cent, which may prompt the apex Bank to cut policy rates in the coming months.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state.

He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state.

He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

Of the total loan growth of Rs 6,597 crore in these two years, loans in Tamil Nadu have grown by 2,969 crore.The data released gains significance in light of the recently-elected AIADMK's election manifesto promise to waive off student loans and farm loans. The election manifesto coincided with the rise in defaults which had compelled to State Bank of Travancore to sell some of its defaulting education loans to asset reconstruction companies. A large part of the education loans in the state are advanced by the troubled Indian Overseas Bank and Indian Bank.The numbers were provided in a reply to a query in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for finance, Santosh Gangwar on July 22. In his reply the minister said that banks were not allowed to seek collateral for loans up to Rs 4 lakh and the government has launched a Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme wherein no collateral or third party guarantee were required for loans up to Rs 7.5 lakh. 53915481 In May this year, Reserve bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan had cautioned against unscrupulous institutions mushrooming to take advantage of this collateral-free loan. “Given the need to broaden access to all the deserving, we have to make degrees affordable. One part of the solution is student loans, but we have to be careful that student loans are repaid in full by those who have the means, while they are forgiven in part for those who fall on bad times, or those who take low paying public service jobs. We also should make sure that unscrupulous schools do not prey on uninformed students, leaving them with high debt and useless degrees,” Rajan had said.According to the data, education loans outstanding as on March 2015 stood at Rs 59,336 crore – an increase of 12% from March 2013. Topping the list of states with the highest growth in absolute terms is Tamil Nadu which has grown 22% to Rs 16,313 crore. The state – which ranks number six in terms of population – has seen its share to total education loans in India rise to 27.5% from 25.3% in FY13. Other states which have shown high growth in education loans are Bihar (Rs 842 crore), Andhra Pradesh (Rs 744 crore), Maharashtra (Rs 458crore) and Kerala (Rs 434 crore). West Bengal and Rajasthan, despite their sizeable population do not make it to the top ten in terms of education loan portfolio.Interestingly, barring HDFC Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Banks, all private banks are aggressively growing their education loan portfolio between FY13 and FY15. The bank’s with the highest market share are SBI (22%), Canara Bank (9%), Punjab National Bank (7%), Indian Overseas Bank (6.5%) and Indian Bank (5%).Even as banks complain about rising bad debts in unsecured education loans, private lenders such as Credila and Avanse are seeing a big opportunity in lending for higher education particularly for reputed institutions. According to specialised lenders, PSU banks are unable to recover their student loans because of their lack of engagement with student and because they do not have the wherewithal to appraise international institutions.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-accounted-for-45-of-growth-in-education-loans/articleshow/53904379.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government.

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world? But I will take whatever defensive measures I have to in the interest of the working class whose jobs are at stake. People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

During his first election rally in Odisha, the Prime Minister urged the people to give the BJP a chance to make Odisha the number one state in the country.In what seemed to be a veiled dig at BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, PM Modi stated, ""Odisha needs a CM who understands Odia language and culture."" He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day. He appealed to the people to allow the BJP to serve the state for once, guaranteeing that Odisha will be transformed into the number one state within the next five years.The prime minister attributed Odisha's backwardness to the ""rampant loot"" by Congress, which ruled the state for 50 years, and the BJD, which has been in power for the past 25 years. He described the BJD as ""sinking,"" Congress as a ""spent force,"" and the BJP as the ""only ray of hope"" for the people.In response to Modi's claim, senior BJD leader and Naveen Patnaik's close aide VK Pandian stated that Naveen Patnaik will take oath as the chief minister of Odisha for the sixth consecutive time between 11.30 am to 1.30 pm on June 9.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-needs-a-cm-who-pm-modi-takes-a-dig-at-naveen-patnaik/articleshow/109878863.cms

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

Advertisers risk suspension for promoting or manipulating porn using AI-gen","Google has updated its advertising policies to explicitly prohibit the promotion of websites and apps that generate deepfake pornography. The new policy, which will take effect on May 30, 2024, aims to combat the rise of services that create sexually explicit content using AI-generated images.Under the updated Inappropriate Content Policy, advertisers will be suspended without warning if they promote sites or apps that generate deepfake porn, provide instructions on how to create it or endorse and compare various deepfake porn services. Violators will no longer be able to publish their ads on Google.Google takes steps to combat explicit deepfakesThis comes amidst growing concerns over the increasing availability of tools that allow users to create manipulated pornographic content. Some of these services reportedly masquerade as wholesome apps to gain listings on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store while openly promoting their ability to generate deepfake porn on social media platforms.Google's existing policies already place strong restrictions on ads featuring certain types of sexual content. However, the update leaves no room for doubt that promoting ""synthetic content that has been altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity"" is a clear violation of the company's rules.Prior to this broader policy change, Google had already started prohibiting services that create sexually explicit deepfakes in Shopping ads. This ban covers deepfake porn tutorials and pages that advertise deepfake porn generators.Advertisers have been allowed to remove any ads that violate the new policy before the May 30 implementation date. In 2023, Google reportedly removed over 1.8 billion ads for violating its policies on sexual content, according to its annual Ads Safety report.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-is-making-its-porn-ads-policy-stricter-with-these-changes/articleshow/109845775.cms

A bench comprising Justices A K Goel and R F Nariman asked the parties to approach the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in the matter in accordance with law. RCom had moved the apex court against the high court order barring it from selling its assets without prior approval. SBI had also moved the top court challenging the tribunal's order, which was later upheld by the high court, allowing Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson to stake a claim on RCom's consolidated assets. The apex court had on March 22 directed maintenance of status quo on the sale of assets of RCom to Reliance Jio. During the hearing today, Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for joint lenders forum led by the SBI, said there was a need to decide the matter soon since the value of properties was ""depleting fast"". However, the bench asked Mehta why they had not joined the proceedings earlier in the high court. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for RCom, said that Ericsson, which had first approached the tribunal that had restrained the sale of assets, was an unsecured creditor. RCom had earlier said that the claims of secured financial lenders stood higher on priority compared to Ericsson and the sale of assets was being undertaken in pursuance of the decisions of the secured financial lenders. Ericsson had then argued in the apex court that if the stay order was vacated, the company would remain remedy-less and may not get its dues back. SBI had said it had total dues worth Rs 4,027 crore against RCom Consolidated and also asserted that unsecured creditor cannot make claims over secured creditors. Apart from SBI, 24 other Indian lenders constitute the joint lenders fora, which includes Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Canara Bank, Central Bank of India, UCO Bank, LIC and others. RCom owes the Indian lenders a total of Rs 42,000 crore and its consolidated assets include Reliance Communications, Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom. The sale was initiated through a bidding of RCom consolidated's assets and Reliance Jio had agreed to buy spectrum, cell towers and other infrastructure, including 1.78 lakh km of fibre optics line for Rs 17,300 crore. RCom assets' sale to Reliance Jio was likely to be completed by March 31. However, Ericsson had moved the arbitral tribunal seeking to restrain the sale of RCom Consolidated's assets on the ground that it had a claim of Rs 1,150 crore on the telecom firm and would suffer an irretrievable injury. On March 5, the tribunal gave an order in favour of Ericsson and restrained the sale of RCom assets. On March 8, the high court dismissed RCom's appeal against the tribunal order.

However, the fate of NOCL may still largely hinge on Haldia Petro’s ability to make upfront payment of Rs 700 crore to finalise the revival path, which involves payment of an additional Rs 750 crore over the next five years.At the October 23 (Tuesday) hearing at the Chennai Bench of NCLT, the counsel for the COC (representing banks led by SBI & IDBI) presented revised terms, which were acceptable to the lenders, as discussed in the COC meeting held on Monday. However, contrary to the last NCLT hearing on NOCL, the lenders refused to reduce or even reconsider the “high” Liquidation Value of Rs 1,450 crore, a fact that was contested consistently by the bidders over the last few hearings.“The lenders insisted Haldia Petro to pay Rs 700 crore initially and the balance (Rs 750 crore) over five years. Haldia Petro drew the attention of all concerned to the fact that the two major lenders of NOCL – SBI (25%) and IDBI (17%) were also the major lenders to Haldia Petro. It sought two weeks to submit a revised plan in accordance with the COC decision,” a source, privy to the development, told TOI.After hearing the submissions of both the COC and Haldia Petro, NCLT drew up an action schedule to pave way for the revival of Nagarjuna Oil refinery project (NOCL). As requested by Haldia Petro, it will convey the board’s decision to COC by November 1, 2018, while COC would meet by November 13, 2018 to consider and decide on Haldia Petro’s fresh proposal.Subsequently, COC should submit its final recommendation on Haldia Petro’s revised proposal to NCLT, Chennai Bench on November 15, 2018.

The slide was the biggest in the last two months, led by banking stocks. The day’s losses in the benchmark indices came also on the back of weak Asian markets and left investors poorer by Rs 1.1 lakh crore, with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 151.1 lakh crore.“A negative trend in Asian markets and the domestic fiscal deficit data impacted market sentiment on Thursday with sharp sell-offs witnessed in frontline indices towards the end of the trading session and ahead of the GDP data,” said Jayant Manglik, president (retail sales), Religare Securities. However, now that the GDP growth figure for the July-September quarter has come in at a respectable 6.3%, market players expect a strong start to Friday’s session.Lenders’ stocks bled the most on Thursday with the BSE’s banking index down 1.9%. Among the sensex stocks, Kotak Bank closed 2.6% lower, SBI 2.5% and Axis Bank was down 2.4% at close. Traders were concerned that in case the rising fiscal deficit numbers force the government to borrow more than what has been budgeted, that might lead to a higher rate of interest in the economy. Since banks are already flush with funds at a time when growth of credit offtake is low, a rising rate of interest would be detrimental to their business and, hence, the selling in these counters.The day’s selling also came on the back of strong foreign fund selling with end-of-the-session data showing a net Rs 1,500 crore outflow by these investors. In contrast, domestic funds had net bought a little over Rs 1,200 crore of stocks on Thursday.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-dives-453pts-as-fiscal-deficit-widens/articleshow/61871506.cms

However, there is still hope for NOCL revival, with the ETA Group chipping in with its bid.NCLT Chennai Bench had set a two-week deadline, at its last hearing on October 23, for the sole bidder Kolkata-based Haldia Petro and Committee of Creditors (COC) to thrash out issues over liquidation value and payment mechanism for NCLT to pass a final order.As per the plan, Haldia Petro was advised to increase its bid offer, while COC was to approve the reworked plan and submit the final proposal for NCLT to approve at its November 16 hearing. The COC was insisting Haldia to make an upfront payment of Rs 700 crore to finalise the revival package, which involved payment of an additional Rs 750 crore over the next five years.“However, Haldia did not revise its earlier bid. Instead, it modified it to make it even less acceptable,” a source in the know of the development told TOI.As per Haldia’s fresh proposal, the resolution professional (RP), appointed for liquidating NOCL, should opt for auctioning the refinery equipment at the site and pay the proceeds to the bank. The balance out of the liquidation value of Rs 1,450 crore minus auction value would be paid by Haldia in instalments over 10 years.“Expectedly, this was rejected by the COC at its November 15 meeting. Consequently, it reiterated its earlier recommendation of liquidation of NOCL made in April, 2018,” the source said.However, the RP informed NCLT that a fresh bid, in a sealed cover, has been received by him on November 15 from Star Thermal Pvt Ltd, Chennai, a company part of the ETA Group owned by Syed Salahuddin. Despite objections from Haldia for the late entry of a new bidder, NCLT directed the RP to process the bid and posted the next hearing to November 28, 2018.In fact, at the October 23 hearing at the Chennai Bench of NCLT, the counsel for the COC (representing banks led by SBI & IDBI) presented revised terms, which were acceptable to the lenders, as discussed in the COC meeting held the previous day.

Investor wealth, as measured in market capitalisation, in bank stocks on Monday shrunk by Rs 21,664 crore as against Rs 63,835 crore gained by the 38 banks listed on the bourses.All but J&K Bank were humbled by Monday's selling. SBI (Rs 6,559 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 5261 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 2196 crore), PNB (Rs 1,386 crore) and Axis Bank (Rs 1214 crore) head the list of biggest wealth destructors. Significantly, the 18-share BSE Bankex turned out one of its worst performances as it was down 8.6% - the maximum for any sector on Monday. Sensex shed 4.8% or 480.35 points, its biggest one-day drop in nearly 3 months, as investors were spooked by falling Asian indices snapping the 5-day rally which had taken it above the psychological mark of 10,000 points last week. Marketmen attributed the fall to investors' tendency of booking where the maximum profits lie. ""This is nothing more than booking profits. Stocks such as Axis Bank (54%), ICICI Bank (47%), PNB (45%), Kotak Mahindra Bank (36%) and SBI (26%) gained the maximum in the last couple of weeks. In the same time-frame, other bank stocks have gained 13-30%. We are not aware of any bad news which could led to the banking sector capitalise as much as it did. Fundamentals are unchanged,"" Hitesh Agrawal, head of research, Angel Broking, said. While SBI was reduced by 9.18% at Rs 1022, ICICI Bank lost 12.27% at Rs 337.95 and Kotak Bank dropped 11.02% at Rs 268.45. Others such as Punjab National Bank slumped 9.97% at Rs 397.15, Yes Bank shed 9.59% at Rs 49.95 and Axis Bank slipped by 7.84% at Rs 397.40. Bank of Baroda, Federal Bank, Union Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Karnataka Bank, Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce also ended weak down 5-7%, data shows. Only Jammu & Kashmir Bank bucked the trend as it rose by nearly 2% to Rs 296.60 adding Rs 28 crore to its investor wealth.

Other insurers cumulatively own only 5 percent.LIC's ownership of G-secs peaked in March 2019 when it held 20.6 per cent and 20.5 per cent in March 2020, according to Swiss brokerage UBS Securities.With $520 billion of total assets under management (AUM), LIC is the largest institutional investor in the around $3 trillion domestic equities market.With 29 per cent share or $130 billion in AUM, LIC also has the largest share of domestic institutional equity AUM, which is a shade more than half of all equity mutual funds in the country, as per an analysis by the brokerage.LIC has about 4 per cent stake in equities, making it the single-largest stakeholder after the government (promoter stake), but this is down from its 2017 peak when it held 4.7 per cent of the market.LIC also has a disproportionately higher share in state-owned stocks with around 9 per cent share.As of December, it owns 10 per cent of RIL, 5 per cent each in TCS, Infosys and ITC, and 4 per cent each in ICICI Bank, L&T and SBI.After the listing, LIC would be the largest investment in the government's portfolio of listed equities -- 43 per cent of $377 billion in AUM.This is important from the point of view of government budget financing through divestment and it will also be the third largest company in terms of marker cap of $172 billion after Reliance Industries ($214 billion) and TCS ($182 billion).With 28 crore policyholders, LIC has the maximum share of household savings.The report said nearly Rs 10 out of every Rs 100 saved by households each year goes to LIC, making it larger than even the perceived staple of household savings -- SBI, which gets around 8 per cent of the bank deposits.It will also be the 32nd-largest based on free float market cap as the government is selling only 5 per cent stake through the IPO. Again RIL leads the free-float market with $108.7 billion, followed by HDFC Bank at $88.2 billion, Infosys ($84.7 billion), ICICI Bank ($72.8 billion, HDFC ($58.2 billion) and TCS ($50.8 billion).But among the state-owned companies, LIC will be the third largest in terms of free-float value at $8.6 billion, after SBI's $27 billion and PowerGrid's $9.4 billion.

Close to 35 companies have added over $1 billion to their investors' wealth in this phase since March 9. Such has been the ferocity of the rally that individually over 1,900 stocks have outperformed the overall market in terms of investor wealth addition. Less than 250 stock counters have actually seen a drop in investor wealth levels.Capital goods player Larsen & Toubro is 10th on the list, having added $2.86 billion wealth to its investors' kitty while banks such as ICICI, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank find a place in the top 30 having added over a billion dollars of investor wealth. PSUs such as MMTC ($2.86 billion), NMDC ($2.34 billion), Bhel ($2.11 billion) and GAIL ($1.81 billion) have also been prominent investor wealth gainers.Tech stocks, which underperformed sensex in the rally, had many takers with TCS, Infosys and Wipro - all having added over $ 2 billion to their market capitalisation in this period. Notably, the rally did not impact the fortune of Satyam's investors much as they lost $40 million of investors' wealth.However, real estate firms have done well in the rally with DLF adding $2.5 billion to investors' wealth, followed by Unitech ($470 million), HDIL ($290 million), Indiabulls Real Estate ($230 million) and Nagarjuna Constructions ($150 million) being the major ones.

While the total claims have been estimated at Rs 26,259 crore, those who booked flats, plots and villas had principal and interest due of Rs 16,373. IDBI Bank, with claims of Rs 4,334 crore, has the next highest vote share (16.5%), followed by IIFCL (3.9%) and SBI (2.9%).A majority say, however, does not mean that homebuyers will be able to push through decisions that completely protect their interest. For a resolution to go through, 66% of the votes have to vote for it. And, it has to be an affirmative vote — which means that those who don’t vote will be treated as negative voters.Insolvency experts said that getting unanimity among homebuyers is a tough task given that they are split into several groups. “There are some who want the apartments that they had booked while there are others who are seeking a refund,” said a buyer.Of the over 28,000 real estate unit holders, 24,300 are active allottees, while another 3,300 have been offered possession.

The sensex sank by 1.4% (440 points) in late trades. During the intra-day session, the sensex was down more than 500 points to a near three-month low, but it recovered after the government clarified about the real picture on the ground along the Indo-Myanmar border.The day’s slide also left investors poorer by more than Rs 6 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 136 lakh crore.Banking stocks led the slide with the sectoral index sliding down 1.7%. Market players said signs of a weakening fiscal situation and the government’s decision to go for a fiscal stimulus are making investors jittery about banks, especially the public sector ones. As a result, the PSU bank index on the NSE has lost 7% in the last one week.In the same period, foreign fund managers have been aggressively selling stocks in India since they find valuations stretched relative to other emerging markets. The US Fed’s decision to pare its $4.2-trillion book is also forcing global investors to opt for less-risky assets, called risk-off trades in market parlance.In a note, BNP Paribas Mutual Fund’s senior fund manager (equities) Karthikraj Lakshmanan said that market participants are selling relatively risky assets like emerging market equities after the US Fed signalled the possibility of an interest rate hike before the end of the year.On Wednesday, BSE data showed foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 856 crore.

The initiative of evening courts followed a report given three months ago by a committee of three high court judges revealing that cheque dishonour complaints under section 138 of the negotiable instruments Act constitute almost two-thirds of the entire workload of magistrates in Delhi.Out of the 7.67 lakh criminal cases pending in the magisterial courts as on June 1, the incidence of bounced cheque alone accounted for 5.15 lakh cases. And as many as 4.28 lakh of those cases were filed by financial institutions, a pattern that links the explosion in cheque bounce cases to the proliferation of EMIs in recent years. If the docket of the criminal courts has gone awry, one major reason is that a reform in the criminal law made in 2002 has made the old civil remedy of filing a suit for recovering the cheque amount pretty much redundant. Violations of Section 138 - the criminal provision - are now punishable not only with imprisonment up to two years but also monetary penalty up to twice the cheque amount, which is then paid to the complainant.The vast difference in the court fee is another reason for cheque bounce cases inundating magistrates.Consider the criminal complaint filed by Bank of India against Delhi businessman C S Ahluwalia for two dishonoured cheques amounting to Rs 1.04 crore. For the case in which a magistrate framed charges last month, all that the bank had to pay as court fee was Rs 1.25.This is because the court fee for all criminal cases is fixed at Rs 1.25 irrespective of the quantum of money involved. Had Bank of India instead filed a civil suit to recover the same cheque amount, it would have had to pay court fee of Rs 1.4 lakh. Besides being exempted from paying a hefty court fee for cheque bounce complaints, financial institutions have devised a method that saves them even lawyer's fee as the bar is also being used as a recovery agent. Since these cases are handled in bulk, financial institutions typically have the leverage to make lawyers work for a contingency fee (a practice prevalent in the US).This means that the lawyer dealing with a cheque bounce case gets paid only when he succeeds in putting pressure on the offender to pay the due amount, whether at the pre-litigation stage (on the basis of his legal notice) or as a settlement before the court. The contingency fee is generally 1% of the realized cheque amount.The August 27 report of the high court committee shows that as on February 29, the three financial institutions that filed the most number of complaints were ICICI Bank (83,523), Citi Financial (51,827) and SBI (30,490). Of the four existing court complexes, Patiala House, which covers the Lutyens' zone and south Delhi, has the heaviest workload of check bounce cases (1.88 lakh). Going by the jurisdiction of police stations, Connaught Place accounts for the most number of complaints (1.12 lakh) followed by Preet Vihar in east Delhi (31,033).manoj.mitta@timesgroup.com ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bounced-cheques-choke-delhi-courts/articleshow/3706199.cms

While the mood was upbeat due to strong performances of stock markets globally, Indian government’s decision to drop the idea of taxing long-term capital gains in the new Direct Tax Bill also boosted the sentiment. The Indian market on Monday opened higher as the better-than-expected employment data for August from US reduced the fear of a double-dip recession, leading to a rally in most of the global markets.On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), metal stocks index rose sharply by around 3.5%, while banking stocks index improved by over 2%. The sensex closed 1.9% higher at 18,560 points, its best close since February 5, 2008, when it touched 18,663 points. The National Stock Exchange’s 50-share nifty rose 1.8% to close at 5,576.95. A senior broker said as government has decided to drop the idea of long-term capital gains tax on equities, retail investors have started coming back in the market. ‘‘This has improved the sentiment,” the broker said. Earlier, as the government was considering to levy this tax, many investors were moving out. The government’s decision to lower the short-term capital gains tax was also seen as a positive development by market players.Reliance Industries, which has maximum weightage in sensex, gained nearly 3% to settle at Rs 953. In the last session, the scrip had fallen 1.2%. Rise in RIL’s share price helped improve the sentiment, which fuelled a rally, feel analysts.Tata Steel and Hindalco were the top two performers in the sensex pack. Tata Steel stock climbed 6.6%. Hindalco also jumped 4.8%, after chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla announced a mega Rs 21,000 crore capex plan for the next two years on last Friday. Banking counters also showed improved performances. ICICI Bank surged 3.8% and SBI 3.1%. The signs of better economic performance in US triggered buying in IT stocks. IT bellwether Infosys added 2.16%, TCS 1.89% and Wipro 0.82%. With economic growth rate is expected to remain strong, analysts feel that the upward movement in the sensex will continue.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

In case the bank is not able to achieve a resolution and the borrower goes into liquidation, the bank will have to provide for the entire loan amount out of its profits.Following Tuesday’s trades, the BSE Bankex has lost all the gains it had made in the last month. PSU banks had rallied immediately after the government said that the RBI would come out with a mechanism for resolving bad loans. Most banks had expected that they would be given some relief in making provisions, allowing them to spread these over the next fiscal. However, the RBI’s new norms require that banks provide for loan losses in FY18 itself.Shares of Syndicate Bank and Punjab National Bank fell nearly 5%, Canara Bank (4.5%), Andhra Bank 4%, Allahabad Bank 3.9%, Bank of Baroda (3.6%), SBI (3.3%), Union Bank of India and Bank of Maharashtra (2.8%) and Axis Bank (2.3%) on the BSE.“The RBI’s guideline to maintain higher provision against loans under the insolvency process has impacted the market direction and plunged it to test the support level of 9,500 (Nifty).

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people.

He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state.

He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state.

He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

During his first election rally in Odisha, the Prime Minister urged the people to give the BJP a chance to make Odisha the number one state in the country.In what seemed to be a veiled dig at BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, PM Modi stated, ""Odisha needs a CM who understands Odia language and culture."" He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day. He appealed to the people to allow the BJP to serve the state for once, guaranteeing that Odisha will be transformed into the number one state within the next five years.The prime minister attributed Odisha's backwardness to the ""rampant loot"" by Congress, which ruled the state for 50 years, and the BJD, which has been in power for the past 25 years.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day. He appealed to the people to allow the BJP to serve the state for once, guaranteeing that Odisha will be transformed into the number one state within the next five years.The prime minister attributed Odisha's backwardness to the ""rampant loot"" by Congress, which ruled the state for 50 years, and the BJD, which has been in power for the past 25 years.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

Power loans may trip next,"India Business News: Among the three lenders that created inventories of stressed assets to “below investment grade companies"", the slippages from the lists have been vary","ET Intelligence Group: In order to give better clarity of the stress they were carrying on their balance sheets, three large banks at the beginning of fiscal 2017 disclosed lists of close to Rs 1 lakh crore of loans from where they expected future slippages to evolve.  Three quarters down the line, close to 39% of these “watch-list"" accounts have slipped into the non-performing category , while only about 6% - Rs 6,100 crore -was either recovered or upgraded from the list.  It appears difficult to conclude which lender has optimally managed its list of loans that would cause future pain given varied parameters. Among the three lenders that created inventories of stressed assets, or loans to “below investment grade companies"", the slippages from the lists have been varying. At 55%, the announced quantum of slippage from the watch list was the highest for Axis Bank, followed by SBI (44%) and ICICI Bank (27%).  With such high level of recognition, Axis appears on track to recognise a substantial portion of the watch list as NPAs as it guided in April last year -the slippages are commensurate with the level of bad assets growth. Between March and December 2016, Axis reported the steepest rise of 355 basis points in its gross NPA ratio, as against ICICI's 199 bps and SBI's 73 bps growth.  The nature of lists differs, too. Axis has only included its fund-based exposures to the list even as in the last nine months it also saw close to Rs 464 crore of devolvement from the non-fund-based (credit guarantees) exposure into the watch list. ICICI Bank includes nonfund-based exposure of the slipped accounts from the list in the total exposure. While Axis has termed its list to be a “closed“ one with no additions to be made over two years ending FY18, SBI has not ruled out changes though the quantum is unlikely to be that big.  This makes the run-rate of slippages from outside the list an interesting tool to gauge the purpose of the watch list. Although SBI, which is confident of not overshooting its FY17 guidance of Rs 40,000 crore of fresh slippages into NPAs, close to a quarter of it so far has come from outside the watch list.  ICICI has seen 48% of its gross slippages come from outside its “further drilldown list"" and expects this runrate to continue. Axis has missed its guidance in this regard, with the outside watch list slippages from corporate book rising from 11% to 30%.  In terms of sectoral recognition, the iron and steel space accounted for a fourth of total slippages from the watch list, and the power sector for more than a third, which is likely to bring the next bout of slippages.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state.

He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people.

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state.

He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people.

During his first election rally in Odisha, the Prime Minister urged the people to give the BJP a chance to make Odisha the number one state in the country.In what seemed to be a veiled dig at BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, PM Modi stated, ""Odisha needs a CM who understands Odia language and culture."" He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day. He appealed to the people to allow the BJP to serve the state for once, guaranteeing that Odisha will be transformed into the number one state within the next five years.The prime minister attributed Odisha's backwardness to the ""rampant loot"" by Congress, which ruled the state for 50 years, and the BJD, which has been in power for the past 25 years. He described the BJD as ""sinking,"" Congress as a ""spent force,"" and the BJP as the ""only ray of hope"" for the people.In response to Modi's claim, senior BJD leader and Naveen Patnaik's close aide VK Pandian stated that Naveen Patnaik will take oath as the chief minister of Odisha for the sixth consecutive time between 11.30 am to 1.30 pm on June 9.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-needs-a-cm-who-pm-modi-takes-a-dig-at-naveen-patnaik/articleshow/109878863.cms

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks.

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world? But I will take whatever defensive measures I have to in the interest of the working class whose jobs are at stake. People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

During his first election rally in Odisha, the Prime Minister urged the people to give the BJP a chance to make Odisha the number one state in the country.In what seemed to be a veiled dig at BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, PM Modi stated, ""Odisha needs a CM who understands Odia language and culture."" He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day. He appealed to the people to allow the BJP to serve the state for once, guaranteeing that Odisha will be transformed into the number one state within the next five years.The prime minister attributed Odisha's backwardness to the ""rampant loot"" by Congress, which ruled the state for 50 years, and the BJD, which has been in power for the past 25 years. He described the BJD as ""sinking,"" Congress as a ""spent force,"" and the BJP as the ""only ray of hope"" for the people.In response to Modi's claim, senior BJD leader and Naveen Patnaik's close aide VK Pandian stated that Naveen Patnaik will take oath as the chief minister of Odisha for the sixth consecutive time between 11.30 am to 1.30 pm on June 9.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-needs-a-cm-who-pm-modi-takes-a-dig-at-naveen-patnaik/articleshow/109878863.cms

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

Advertisers risk suspension for promoting or manipulating porn using AI-gen","Google has updated its advertising policies to explicitly prohibit the promotion of websites and apps that generate deepfake pornography. The new policy, which will take effect on May 30, 2024, aims to combat the rise of services that create sexually explicit content using AI-generated images.Under the updated Inappropriate Content Policy, advertisers will be suspended without warning if they promote sites or apps that generate deepfake porn, provide instructions on how to create it or endorse and compare various deepfake porn services. Violators will no longer be able to publish their ads on Google.Google takes steps to combat explicit deepfakesThis comes amidst growing concerns over the increasing availability of tools that allow users to create manipulated pornographic content. Some of these services reportedly masquerade as wholesome apps to gain listings on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store while openly promoting their ability to generate deepfake porn on social media platforms.Google's existing policies already place strong restrictions on ads featuring certain types of sexual content. However, the update leaves no room for doubt that promoting ""synthetic content that has been altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity"" is a clear violation of the company's rules.Prior to this broader policy change, Google had already started prohibiting services that create sexually explicit deepfakes in Shopping ads. This ban covers deepfake porn tutorials and pages that advertise deepfake porn generators.Advertisers have been allowed to remove any ads that violate the new policy before the May 30 implementation date. In 2023, Google reportedly removed over 1.8 billion ads for violating its policies on sexual content, according to its annual Ads Safety report.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-is-making-its-porn-ads-policy-stricter-with-these-changes/articleshow/109845775.cms

The approv","MUMBAI: The board of State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday approved a proposal to invest Rs 7,250 crore in Yes Bank by purchasing 725 crore shares. The approval is subject to the condition that the public-sector lender's holding will remain within 49% of the paid-up capital of Yes Bank.While the amount is higher than the Rs 2,450 crore indicated earlier in the RBI's draft plan, it is lower than the Rs 10,000 crore that SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had said that the bank was willing to infuse in the troubled private lender.Also, if the purchase of 725 crore shares is intended to help SBI acquire a 49% stake, the total capital-raising is unlikely to be more than Rs 15,000 crore. The paid-up capital could go higher than Rs 15,000 crore if SBI allows its stake to fall below 49% and other investors - including private banks - pick up a stake of at least 35%.Given that the private lender's authorised capital has been raised to Rs 5,000 crore by the RBI, Yes Bank can raise an additional Rs 10,000 crore even after SBI's Rs 7,250-crore investment. Of this, there is a likelihood that Rs 1,750 crore could come from the conversion of additional tier-1 bonds with investors agreeing to the conversion.In its reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank, the RBI said that the investor would need to invest in the equity of the reconstructed bank to the extent that post-infusion it holds 49% at a price of not less than Rs 10 per share of Rs 2.Shares of Yes Bank, which were on the upswing after RBI's reconstruction plan, slipped 13% on Thursday in line with the global market collapse. Shares of the private lender closed at Rs 25, which values the bank at Rs 6,389 crore - more than twice RBI's valuation of the private lender under its reconstruction scheme.Besides SBI, private lenders including HDFC group, ICICI Bank group, Kotak Group and private investors like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and R K Damani are expected to participate.Meanwhile, India Ratings in a report said that the delays in resuming normal services could impact the near-term liquidity of some of the bank's customers. Also, corporate groups with a large dependency on the bank could face a longer period of disruption. ""These disruptions could stem from their usage of Yes Bank as a lender for facilities such as cash credit, letters of credit (LCs), bank guarantees (BGs) and other working capital facilities as well as a term debt provider.

Asked by the industrialist what his government was doing to curb the growth of syndicates that were creating fear psychosis in the minds of investors, Mitra pointed out that the Mamata Banerjee government had inherited one crore unemployed youth from the earlier regime. “Syndicate has a history of the past much before we came to power. Our chief minister Mamata Banerjee is addressing the issue and she has taken a zero-tolerance policy for this. There will be strong administrative measures and we have to create employment,” he added. Mitra also urged SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya present at the conclave to help the state government create more job opportunities and employment. “The political economy is all about employment. If you see economic history then when there is employment there is political stability. When there is no employment then there is bound to be disruption. I urge SBI and other banks to take care of this political economy,” he added. Pointing to the low credit deposit (CD) ratio of SBI (50.58%) in Bengal, the state finance minister said the largest PSU lender along with other banks should step up credit growth in three sectors which have huge employment potential: agriculture, self-help groups and MSME (medium and small medium enterprises), he added.Bhattacharya later admitted that a CD ratio of 50.58% in Bengal was below comfort level but felt the right atmosphere had to be created for credit absorption. “Unless there is proper atmosphere for credit absorption, a higher level of credit could lead to higher non-performing assets (NPA),” she said.The SBI chairman suggested that in Bengal, SBI can do value-chain financing in agriculture. “We can finance farmers, logistics, cold chain to processing, where we shall have a better control over cash flow.

In a bid to ease the strain at banks, several volunteers came forward. These volunteers were seen across SBI branches, talking to customers, helping them with clarifications, running around for pens, forms and water. From retired army men to working professionals and students, people from all walks of life could be seen easing the exchange process at banks.After a cousin banker skipped lunch to attend to over 1,200 customers on Saturday, Senthil Nayagam, an entrepreneur, spent his Sunday volunteering at the SBI branch in Villivakkam. Overnight, Chennai Volunteers or Chennai Tricolor was created to mobilise volunteers in the city and within a day, over 200 people have registered. Working with SBI, 50 branches have been identified in areas such as Adyar, Mogappair, Anna Nagar, Nanganallur and Mylapore and over 100 volunteers were at multiple banks on Tuesday and Wednesday. While banks did not encourage volunteers to fill forms unless absolutely necessary, they were seen manning the queue, assisting with stationary and water and clearing doubts.Giving youngsters a run for their money, retired Air Force employee G Athimoolam, aged 69, was bank hopping on Tuesday. “My father can’t stand for too long due to his age. So he helped in whichever way he could at multiple branches. It is inspiring when people see an aged man working for a humanitarian cause,” said Nayagam. At the SBI branch in Thiruvanmiyur, a foreigner was looking flummoxed with four Rs 1,000 notes in hand. The bank was not willing to tender change because he had already exchanged demonetised currency notes to the tune of Rs 4,000 a few days before. Volunteers turned saviours and handed over their new Rs 2,000 notes to him. “As goodwill ambassadors of India, we gave him our notes so that he doesn’t have to come back to the bank again,” a volunteer said.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people.

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world?

People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people.

During his first election rally in Odisha, the Prime Minister urged the people to give the BJP a chance to make Odisha the number one state in the country.In what seemed to be a veiled dig at BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, PM Modi stated, ""Odisha needs a CM who understands Odia language and culture."" He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day. He appealed to the people to allow the BJP to serve the state for once, guaranteeing that Odisha will be transformed into the number one state within the next five years.The prime minister attributed Odisha's backwardness to the ""rampant loot"" by Congress, which ruled the state for 50 years, and the BJD, which has been in power for the past 25 years. He described the BJD as ""sinking,"" Congress as a ""spent force,"" and the BJP as the ""only ray of hope"" for the people.In response to Modi's claim, senior BJD leader and Naveen Patnaik's close aide VK Pandian stated that Naveen Patnaik will take oath as the chief minister of Odisha for the sixth consecutive time between 11.30 am to 1.30 pm on June 9.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-needs-a-cm-who-pm-modi-takes-a-dig-at-naveen-patnaik/articleshow/109878863.cms

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

Violators will no longer be able to publish their ads on Google.Google takes steps to combat explicit deepfakesThis comes amidst growing concerns over the increasing availability of tools that allow users to create manipulated pornographic content.

However, the update leaves no room for doubt that promoting ""synthetic content that has been altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity"" is a clear violation of the company's rules.Prior to this broader policy change, Google had already started prohibiting services that create sexually explicit deepfakes in Shopping ads. This ban covers deepfake porn tutorials and pages that advertise deepfake porn generators.Advertisers have been allowed to remove any ads that violate the new policy before the May 30 implementation date.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

During his first election rally in Odisha, the Prime Minister urged the people to give the BJP a chance to make Odisha the number one state in the country.In what seemed to be a veiled dig at BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, PM Modi stated, ""Odisha needs a CM who understands Odia language and culture."" He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day. He appealed to the people to allow the BJP to serve the state for once, guaranteeing that Odisha will be transformed into the number one state within the next five years.The prime minister attributed Odisha's backwardness to the ""rampant loot"" by Congress, which ruled the state for 50 years, and the BJD, which has been in power for the past 25 years. He described the BJD as ""sinking,"" Congress as a ""spent force,"" and the BJP as the ""only ray of hope"" for the people.In response to Modi's claim, senior BJD leader and Naveen Patnaik's close aide VK Pandian stated that Naveen Patnaik will take oath as the chief minister of Odisha for the sixth consecutive time between 11.30 am to 1.30 pm on June 9.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-needs-a-cm-who-pm-modi-takes-a-dig-at-naveen-patnaik/articleshow/109878863.cms

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

Advertisers risk suspension for promoting or manipulating porn using AI-gen","Google has updated its advertising policies to explicitly prohibit the promotion of websites and apps that generate deepfake pornography. The new policy, which will take effect on May 30, 2024, aims to combat the rise of services that create sexually explicit content using AI-generated images.Under the updated Inappropriate Content Policy, advertisers will be suspended without warning if they promote sites or apps that generate deepfake porn, provide instructions on how to create it or endorse and compare various deepfake porn services. Violators will no longer be able to publish their ads on Google.Google takes steps to combat explicit deepfakesThis comes amidst growing concerns over the increasing availability of tools that allow users to create manipulated pornographic content. Some of these services reportedly masquerade as wholesome apps to gain listings on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store while openly promoting their ability to generate deepfake porn on social media platforms.Google's existing policies already place strong restrictions on ads featuring certain types of sexual content. However, the update leaves no room for doubt that promoting ""synthetic content that has been altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity"" is a clear violation of the company's rules.Prior to this broader policy change, Google had already started prohibiting services that create sexually explicit deepfakes in Shopping ads. This ban covers deepfake porn tutorials and pages that advertise deepfake porn generators.Advertisers have been allowed to remove any ads that violate the new policy before the May 30 implementation date.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

During his first election rally in Odisha, the Prime Minister urged the people to give the BJP a chance to make Odisha the number one state in the country.In what seemed to be a veiled dig at BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, PM Modi stated, ""Odisha needs a CM who understands Odia language and culture."" He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day. He appealed to the people to allow the BJP to serve the state for once, guaranteeing that Odisha will be transformed into the number one state within the next five years.The prime minister attributed Odisha's backwardness to the ""rampant loot"" by Congress, which ruled the state for 50 years, and the BJD, which has been in power for the past 25 years. He described the BJD as ""sinking,"" Congress as a ""spent force,"" and the BJP as the ""only ray of hope"" for the people.In response to Modi's claim, senior BJD leader and Naveen Patnaik's close aide VK Pandian stated that Naveen Patnaik will take oath as the chief minister of Odisha for the sixth consecutive time between 11.30 am to 1.30 pm on June 9.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-needs-a-cm-who-pm-modi-takes-a-dig-at-naveen-patnaik/articleshow/109878863.cms

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

The new policy, which will take effect on May 30, 2024, aims to combat the rise of services that create sexually explicit content using AI-generated images.Under the updated Inappropriate Content Policy, advertisers will be suspended without warning if they promote sites or apps that generate deepfake porn, provide instructions on how to create it or endorse and compare various deepfake porn services. Violators will no longer be able to publish their ads on Google.Google takes steps to combat explicit deepfakesThis comes amidst growing concerns over the increasing availability of tools that allow users to create manipulated pornographic content. Some of these services reportedly masquerade as wholesome apps to gain listings on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store while openly promoting their ability to generate deepfake porn on social media platforms.Google's existing policies already place strong restrictions on ads featuring certain types of sexual content. However, the update leaves no room for doubt that promoting ""synthetic content that has been altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity"" is a clear violation of the company's rules.Prior to this broader policy change, Google had already started prohibiting services that create sexually explicit deepfakes in Shopping ads. This ban covers deepfake porn tutorials and pages that advertise deepfake porn generators.Advertisers have been allowed to remove any ads that violate the new policy before the May 30 implementation date.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception.

Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security. I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border. This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi governmentOn the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world? But I will take whatever defensive measures I have to in the interest of the working class whose jobs are at stake. People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious.

During his first election rally in Odisha, the Prime Minister urged the people to give the BJP a chance to make Odisha the number one state in the country.In what seemed to be a veiled dig at BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, PM Modi stated, ""Odisha needs a CM who understands Odia language and culture."" He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state. The prime minister also mentioned that the Centre provided Rs 10,000 crore under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission' scheme to Odisha, but the BJD dispensation failed to utilize the funds properly.The prime minister highlighted Odisha's fertile land, mineral resources, and sea coasts, but pointed out that people remain poor. He said, ""We released a visionary manifesto for Odisha promising jobs for youths and women and health facilities for senior citizens. BJP fulfils what it says.""PM Modi invited the people to the swearing-in ceremony of BJP's CM on June 10, promising to implement the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on the same day.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

The new policy, which will take effect on May 30, 2024, aims to combat the rise of services that create sexually explicit content using AI-generated images.Under the updated Inappropriate Content Policy, advertisers will be suspended without warning if they promote sites or apps that generate deepfake porn, provide instructions on how to create it or endorse and compare various deepfake porn services. Violators will no longer be able to publish their ads on Google.Google takes steps to combat explicit deepfakesThis comes amidst growing concerns over the increasing availability of tools that allow users to create manipulated pornographic content.

The Centre will pick up 31.43 crore equity shares of RBI with a face value of Rs 10 each on June 29 for a cash payment of Rs 35,351.33 crore, official sources said. SBI shares closed at Rs 1,470.35, up Rs 23.15 or 1.6 per cent, on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Thursday. In comparison, the government is buying the stake at a discounted price of about Rs 1,124.7 per share. In Mumbai, SBI Chairman O P Bhatt said government equity would be brought down to 51 per cent once necessary transfers of RBI'share in SBI to the government are completed. The government had promulgated SBI Amendment Ordinance 2007 on June 21 to amend State Bank of India Act 1955 for buying RBI's entire shareholding in SBI. The move to buy RBI's stake is aimed at enabling the central bank to concentrate on its core function of banking regulator. The deal will not have revenue implications for the government since RBI is expected to transfer the surplus to the Centre during the first half of August. As per the normal procedure, a bill will be moved in the coming session of Parliament to replace the ordinance. The sources said the Finance Ministry had to push for an ordinance as a bill to amend the Act is pending with a Parliamentary standing committee. The Ministry wanted to insert a clause enabling it to buy RBI's stake when it came back to the House, but in the absence of the standing committee report, it pushed for an ordinance to close the transaction in time.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

He claimed that Odisha has not benefitted from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana because the ""BJD government did not implement"" it in the state.

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

Violators will no longer be able to publish their ads on Google.Google takes steps to combat explicit deepfakesThis comes amidst growing concerns over the increasing availability of tools that allow users to create manipulated pornographic content.

However, the update leaves no room for doubt that promoting ""synthetic content that has been altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity"" is a clear violation of the company's rules.Prior to this broader policy change, Google had already started prohibiting services that create sexually explicit deepfakes in Shopping ads. This ban covers deepfake porn tutorials and pages that advertise deepfake porn generators.Advertisers have been allowed to remove any ads that violate the new policy before the May 30 implementation date.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

The new policy, which will take effect on May 30, 2024, aims to combat the rise of services that create sexually explicit content using AI-generated images.Under the updated Inappropriate Content Policy, advertisers will be suspended without warning if they promote sites or apps that generate deepfake porn, provide instructions on how to create it or endorse and compare various deepfake porn services. Violators will no longer be able to publish their ads on Google.Google takes steps to combat explicit deepfakesThis comes amidst growing concerns over the increasing availability of tools that allow users to create manipulated pornographic content. Some of these services reportedly masquerade as wholesome apps to gain listings on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store while openly promoting their ability to generate deepfake porn on social media platforms.Google's existing policies already place strong restrictions on ads featuring certain types of sexual content. However, the update leaves no room for doubt that promoting ""synthetic content that has been altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity"" is a clear violation of the company's rules.Prior to this broader policy change, Google had already started prohibiting services that create sexually explicit deepfakes in Shopping ads. This ban covers deepfake porn tutorials and pages that advertise deepfake porn generators.Advertisers have been allowed to remove any ads that violate the new policy before the May 30 implementation date.

sbi,2024-05-03T20:40:00+05:30,Durgesh Nandan Jha,Should you worry about the Covid vaccine you took?,"Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, decodes the news about AstraZeneca’s disclosure that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare","During the hearing of a case in the UK, pharma giant AstraZeneca told the court that its Covid vaccine — called Covishield in India — might cause a rare blood clot disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). To understand the side effect and the safety of vaccines, we spoke to Dr Kameshwar Prasad, emeritus professor of neurology at AIIMS, New Delhi. Edited excerpts:What is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported as a rare side effect of the Covishield vaccine? How serious is this condition?The condition is rare. But if it happens, it is usually serious, particularly when major vessels are involved in thrombosis. The brain is one of the organs affected. What is seen is the clotting of veins and venous channels inside the brain. Often they are extensive, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. This requires hospitalisation and sometimes results in a threat to life. Other organs may also get affected.One of the big veins draining blood from the intestines, called the splanchnic vein, an unusual site for clotting, may also get clotted and result in stagnation of blood in the intestines and [cause] damage to these, potentially threatening [the person’s] life. Usual sites of clotting like leg veins may also get clotted.One thing which should be kept in mind is that TTS also rarely occurs with the Janssen vaccine which was used in the US. The condition which occurs in association with this vaccine can be as serious as the one with Covishield.Another term used to describe a condition caused by vaccines is called vaccine-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VITT), but when there is evidence to say that vaccine is the most likely cause of the condition. The evidence comes in the form of antibodies to platelet-activating factor 4 (PF4).This means that one is not sure that TTS has been caused by the vaccine, whereas VITT is certainly caused by the vaccine. This may be because the PF4 test was not done or not available to confirm in all cases of TTS.How common is it to have serious or rare side effects from taking vaccines?The condition is very rare. We were members of a committee which developed a WHO guideline where the frequency of this condition has been estimated as less than 1 to 7 per lakh vaccinees.Estimates of the risk of TTS following Covishield vaccination range from 1 case per 26,500 after the first doses of Covishield administered (reported in Norway) to 1 case per 261,000 doses of Janssen [vaccine] administered (reported in the US). The risk of VITT after second and subsequent doses of Covishield appears to be far lower; 2.1 cases per million second doses (reported in the UK) and 2.2 cases per million second doses (reported in Australia).⁠Is there a demographic angle to the side effects of a vaccine in terms of age, gender, medical condition or ethnicity?Young age (less than 50 years) is considered a risk factor. The epidemiologic data from India are not known to me but in England, they have found that in a population of 55 lakh vaccinees, they had 2.4 cases of TTS per lakh vaccinees. As the number of cases is small, studies face challenges in detecting and establishing risk factors.However, the England study found that the male gender and age above 65 put people at higher risk of TTS following vaccination than females and younger than 65. Moreover, chronic diseases of heart, kidney, liver, neurological diseases and cancer were found to place such affected persons at higher risk of developing TTS. The female gender and previous history of thrombosis or pregnancy have been looked into but it was found that they do not increase the risk of TTS.⁠Social media is abuzz with unsubstantiated claims that Indians may be more susceptible to the side effects of Covishield. How do you see those claims?There is no clear evidence to support such a claim. In England, more than 55 lakh people did not report any increased incidence of TTS following vaccination among any race, apparently including Indian immigrants.Once a vaccine is administered, how long does it take for any negative effects to appear? In other words, when can a vaccine receiver feel absolutely safe?This condition called TTS mostly occurs from day 3 to day 30 after the first dose of vaccine. Beyond 30 days, there are very very few cases reported. If the first dose did not have this complication, it’s very unlikely that the second dose would cause TTS.In any case, after one month of vaccination, there is a negligible chance that TTS will develop, certainly after three months. Now that more than a year has passed since the last vaccine dose of Covid for most people from India, there is no need to worry about TTS.⁠This incident has given a boost to anti-vaxxers, who campaign to develop natural immunity against induced immunity. Do you see this as a challenge to the general vaccination campaign against various diseases?Yes, but this is a misconception. The benefits of the vaccine so clearly outweigh any harm that any concern is misplaced.What is your advice to those thinking about getting a vaccine shot for themselves or their children?People should not hesitate to take vaccines rolled out by the government. It is done after it is certain that the benefits outweigh the risks. Risks may not be more than moving on a road.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-you-worry-about-the-covid-vaccine-you-took/articleshow/109822947.cms

Justice N J Jamadar who pronounced the order said he ""partly allowed'' Goyal's bail plea with conditions and posted the bail bond at Rs 1 lakh with a like surety. The HC declined Goyal’s plea for cash bail to ensure immediate release.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him on Sept 1, 2023.Over eight months later, Goyal is likely to head home within the next two days. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had opposed his bail plea noting that he is already hospitalized at a private hospital of his choice and there was no expert opinion certifying him fit to be discharged, hence bail ought not to be considered at this stage.Goyal’s senior counsel Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda with advocate Ameet Naik, however, had argued that Goyal was diagnosed with cancer and advised Whipple's surgery which is a very high-risk surgery. Chemotherapy may only curb the spread of cancer but not cure the cancer, Salve appearing via videoconferencing from London had argued.Goyal’s wife recently had a relapse of her cancer, his counsel also informed the HC adding that she “may have few months left to live.’’ In these circumstances, to keep him in the hospital where he cannot be with his wife is a gross violation of basic human rights, his bail application contended adding, “Prisoners of war are not accorded treatment that is so degrading and inhuman.’’Goyal’s latest April 23 medical report from Reliance Hospital suggests in light of his wife’s condition he will not undergo Whipple surgery but only chemotherapy at this stage and his precarious health would fall within the stringent provisions of section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which govern bail and carve out an exception.His plea is that even under special more stringent laws like the PMLA pre-trial incarceration must be balanced with the basic human rights of the accused and “cannot be used to inflict a de-facto death penalty on the accused.’’The reasoned order of the bail will be available later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-on-medical-grounds/articleshow/109882264.cms
sbi,2024-05-05T13:32:00+05:30,Rema Nagarajan,TB treatment is free. But are patients facing crippling costs?,Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases. Yet patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components,"Even though TB treatment is free for registered patients, a study has found that over 60% incurred “catastrophic expenditure” when the difference between household income reported by the patient before TB and during TB treatment was calculated. Many patients became unemployed and lost income because of the disease, and they had to spend more money buying additional food/nutritional supplements during the treatment. This was revealed in a paper published in PLOS Global Public Health Journal recently. The paper was based on a study in which 1,482 drug-susceptible TB patients from 118 TB units and 182 tea gardens across 16 districts of Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were interviewed between March 2019 and September 2022 to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic burden associated with TB treatment.In the context of TB, expenditure is defined as catastrophic when it is 20% or more of a household’s pre-TB annual income. At least 30% of the patients in the study incurred catastrophic expenses when the indirect cost of seeking treatment was calculated by multiplying the reported time spent on seeking and receiving care during the TB episode by either minimum wage rate or the reported hourly wage rate of the patient. Another method of calculating catastrophic expenditure pushed that proportion up to 61%.For over half of the patients in the study, costs became catastrophic even before starting treatment as there was an average delay of seven weeks (in the case of tea garden workers) to nine weeks (for urban slum dwellers) from the onset of symptoms to the start of treatment, which was double the generally accepted delay of four weeks. ShowBlurbsNearly three-quarters of the study participants among general population and urban slum dwellers (72%-75%) first contacted a private provider after exhibiting symptoms and they made on average 8–11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel before they were diagnosed with TB. Among tea garden residents, only 31% of study participants’ first choice was a private provider as they mostly accessed the tea estate hospital, a government hospital or charitable hospital. medium nocaption109860364Government policy is to provide free diagnosis and treatment to all registered TB cases; these include basic diagnostic tests (most common tests are sputum smear microscopy, chest x-ray and rapid molecular tests) and anti-TB medications. Patients pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for several other components such as consultation fees, non-TB drugs, other diagnostic tests (for example, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imagining, biopsy), travel expenses in pre-treatment period (from symptoms manifesting to treatment starting) and travel expenses for picking up TB drugs, additional food/nutritional supplements, and management of side effects during the treatment period.The study found that patients with extrapulmonary TB (TB involving organs other than lungs) ended up spending much more than other TB patients. While treatment cost ranged from Rs 24,318 to Rs 27,540 for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, it ranged from Rs 33,547 to Rs 48,320 for EPTB patients. The cost incurred by PTB patients in the pre-treatment phase was 46%-50% of the total treatment cost among the general population and urban slum dwellers. For ETB patients it was 68%. It was 32% even among ETB patients from tea gardens.The reason for the much higher pretreatment cost for EPTB patients was expenses incurred in tests for confirming TB. As most of the diagnostic tests required for EPTB patients were not available in most government hospitals and patients relied on private laboratories for these tests, their pre-treatment cost increased significantly.  medium109855126Several studies have reported that the presence of coping strategies could also be an indicator of catastrophe for TB-affected households. Hence this study sought information from patients about their coping strategies for managing the cost of the disease and other economic consequences such as reducing consumption, other household members starting to work, pulling out children from school/ private tuition, running up accounts in shops, etc. It was found that 28%-44% of participants borrowed money during the intensive phase of treatment (2-4 months at the start) while 23%-34% borrowed during the rest of the treatment period and a significant proportion had to sell or mortgage personal belongings.Based on their findings, the authors of the study recommended ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment along with interventions to bring down pre-treatment costs by cutting down delay in diagnosis and treatment and reimbursement of pre-treatment costs as a short-term measure to mitigate financial hardship. Measurement of catastrophic cost related to TB would be an important indicator towards policy decisions to achieve the zero catastrophic cost goal, which was supposed to be achieved by 2020 as envisioned in the End TB strategy, concluded the authors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-treatment-is-free-but-are-patients-facing-crippling-costs/articleshow/109853004.cms

Advertisers risk suspension for promoting or manipulating porn using AI-gen","Google has updated its advertising policies to explicitly prohibit the promotion of websites and apps that generate deepfake pornography. The new policy, which will take effect on May 30, 2024, aims to combat the rise of services that create sexually explicit content using AI-generated images.Under the updated Inappropriate Content Policy, advertisers will be suspended without warning if they promote sites or apps that generate deepfake porn, provide instructions on how to create it or endorse and compare various deepfake porn services. Violators will no longer be able to publish their ads on Google.Google takes steps to combat explicit deepfakesThis comes amidst growing concerns over the increasing availability of tools that allow users to create manipulated pornographic content. Some of these services reportedly masquerade as wholesome apps to gain listings on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store while openly promoting their ability to generate deepfake porn on social media platforms.Google's existing policies already place strong restrictions on ads featuring certain types of sexual content. However, the update leaves no room for doubt that promoting ""synthetic content that has been altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity"" is a clear violation of the company's rules.Prior to this broader policy change, Google had already started prohibiting services that create sexually explicit deepfakes in Shopping ads. This ban covers deepfake porn tutorials and pages that advertise deepfake porn generators.Advertisers have been allowed to remove any ads that violate the new policy before the May 30 implementation date. In 2023, Google reportedly removed over 1.8 billion ads for violating its policies on sexual content, according to its annual Ads Safety report.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-is-making-its-porn-ads-policy-stricter-with-these-changes/articleshow/109845775.cms

The financial services conglomerate, with around Rs 1-lakh-crore public debt, is gasping for liquidity after failing to meet certain repayment obligations and triggering fears of loan recalls.The emergency meeting is expected to convey the intensifying crisis at IL&FS to all the main shareholders and also possibly expedite a proposed Rs 4,500-crore rights issue, which is scheduled for early November. On the positive side, all prominent shareholders — LIC, Orix of Japan, SBI, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and HDFC — have agreed in principle to participate in the rights issue.The latest activity follows a group company, IL&FS Financial Services, failing to meet repayment obligations through a commercial paper borrowing last month. This has resulted in the RBI barring the company from raising short-term funds through this route until 2019. The technical default has promoted other lenders to check on their loans over fears of default. “IL&FS is seeking a Rs 3,000-4,000 crore loan to stall a deepening crisis, which carries crucial ramifications in sectors like infrastructure and the broader economy,” sources said. IL&FS will inform shareholders that the funding will be secured as it has claims of Rs 8,000 crore from various state governments for road projects. These payments are stuck over dispute on the actual amount, but nearly 80% of the claims are acknowledged as a liability. It is also telling shareholders that it is changing its project structure to avoid disputes in future. IL&FS, however, declined to comment. IL&FS has also been in talks with three investors — Lone Star, ISquared Capital and National Infrastructure Investment Fund — to sell some of its road portfolios to pare debt. These negotiations have taken time as potential acquirers scrutinise investment returns on these assets. IL&FS Transportation Networks has 28 build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, most of which are operational.On the rights issue, the company is telling shareholders that they will be able to increase their stakes at a “very attractive” valuation by subscribing to a rights issue currently. LIC, the largest shareholder with 25.34% stake, is prepared to provide funds. However, insurance laws do not allow raising ownership and LIC risks increasing the stake if other shareholders do not invest.Among the other large investors is Orix Corporation of Japan (with 23.5%) — which is inclined to invest, while ADIA (12.6%), which has called for more information, is most likely committed to participating in the rights issue.Although SBI (6.4% stake) too has been liquidating its non-core assets, it is willing to put in more money. HDFC, one of the early promoters with a 9% stake, is also willing to invest but does not want to increase its stake. Among its investors, Central Bank of India, which holds a 7.7% stake, is unlikely to subscribe as it is facing capital pressures on its own.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/crisis-hit-ilfs-seeks-rs-3k-cr-loan/articleshow/65712290.cms
