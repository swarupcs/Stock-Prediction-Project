Check top 4 picks","Infosys, TCS and HCL Tech remain top picks of brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities followed by Cyient in the mid-tier segment amid an extended outlook for weak demand and macro uncertainty in the IT sector.","Infosys, TCS and HCL Tech remain top picks of brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities followed by Cyient in the mid-tier segment amid an extended outlook for weak demand and macro uncertainty in the IT sector.“Recovery hopes have been pushed back to FY2026. Stock price corrections in the past few months have made valuations more palatable. Infosys is our top pick followed by TCS and HCLT. We like Cyient among mid-tier. Further correction can make other mid-tier IT stocks interesting,” stated the report.Here’s a summary of the target price for the above-mentioned stocks:InfosysThe target price for the stock has been set at Rs 1,750, with a ‘buy’ rating. This indicates an upside potential of 22.7%.TCSKIE recommends a target price of Rs 4,300, signaling a 9.7% upside from the current market price of Rs 3,992.HCL TechnologiesHCL’s target price has been fixed 17.7% higher at Rs 1,600.CyientThe target price for Cyient is placed at Rs 2,275, 28% higher than the current price.The brokerage views that Infosys has a reasonable growth visibility in FY2025 aided by large deal wins in the past few quarters and will stand to benefit disproportionately compared to Tier-1 peers when discretionary spending picks up. Stocks such as LTIM and Persistent have come off from highs but still trade at expensive valuations. Mid-tier grew at an aggregate of 3.5% year-on-year (YoY) compared to 0.1% YoY growth of Tier-1. The difference in growth rates has reduced significantly in the past several quarters although mid-tier continues to outpace Tier-1 on growth.“IT companies outlook leads to a reset of both growth and margin expectations for FY2025. Revenue growth guidance for FY2025 missed expectations for all companies. Modest guidance was driven by a weak discretionary spending environment, continuation of ramp-downs in existing engagements although at a lower pace and slower conversion of pipeline to TCV and revenue. Companies do not expect any improvement in FY2025,” Kotak further added.IT firms indicated working on several gen AI PoCs for clients but have not provided any break-up of revenue from generative AI, unlike Accenture. At the current stage of adoption, it appears that the revenue from generative AI projects is not significant for Indian IT. Scaled-up programs and foundation work required for AI such as the development of appropriate cloud and data infrastructure can drive revenues in case the adoption increases among clients.Also read: Vijay Kedia's Portfolio: 4 stocks surge 25-60% in CY24; do you own any?(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The company has rolled out 4G services in Punjab using indigenously developed technology by IT company TCS and state-run telecom research organisation C-DoT-led consortium and onboarded around 8 lakh subscribers.   The 4G core developed by C-DoT is performing very well in the BSNL network in Punjab. It was installed in July last year. It takes 12 month to prove the success of such complex technology but the C-DoT core has stabilised within 10 months. BSNL will launch atmanirbhar 4G technology across the country in August,  a senior government official, who did not wish to be named, told PTI.  The core network is a collection of network hardware, devices, and software that provides fundamental services in a telecommunication network. Telecom regulator Trai in a recent paper explained core as part of a network that offers the functionality of aggregation, call control, switching, authentication, charging, gateway functionality, etc.  TCS, Tejas Networks and government-owned ITI have bagged orders worth about Rs 19,000 crore from BSNL for deploying 4G network which is upgradable to 5G.  In a recent earnings call, Tejas Networks Executive Director and chief operating officer Arnob Roy said BSNL's mobile network is getting deployed across zones.  He said that wherever the C-DOT core is not available on the BSNL network, the equipment is getting integrated to the existing core.   When the C-DOT core gets deployed in those circles, in those zones, they will get parented to the C-DOT core as well. Tejas Networks Limited. This is just a temporary situation where the RAN (radio access network) is deployed and in that zone, the core is not available,  Roy said.  BSNL is in the process of deploying 1.12 lakh towers for 4G and 5G services across India.   The company has installed over 9,000 towers for 4G service across the country, out of which more than 6,000 are active in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, UP West and Haryana circle. BSNL has been selling 4G capable SIM only for the last 4-5 years. Only those customers who have older SIM will need to get new SIM to experience the service,  a BSNL official said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/telecom/telecom-news/bsnl-to-launch-4g-services-across-india-in-august-to-use-indigenous-technology/articleshow/109883938.cms

Europe's booming tech sector, outpacing North America, has fueled over a dozen acquisitions since the pandemic.","Indian outsourcing leaders are increasingly acquiring companies in Europe, where the pace of revenue expansion has lately dwarfed growth rates the other side Atlantic seaboard to justify about a dozen M&As in the continent since the pandemic.While last week’s acquisition announcement of in-tech by Infosys is tipped to be the largest in the latter’s history, even Capco’s acquisition by Wipro in 2021 is the largest ever acquisition made by the company.HCLTech has done three major acquisitions overseas in the last two years, all in Europe. Similarly, for Tech Mahindra, acquisition of CTC (Com Tec Co IT Ltd) in 2022, is the second-largest acquisition that the company has made after scam-hit Satyam in April 2010.An email to Infosys didn’t elicit any response until the publication of this report.Out of the total number of acquisitions done by Infosys in the last six years, nearly 40% focused on Europe. In absolute numbers, the IT major made a total of 16 acquisitions since April 2018, and out of that six were done in Europe, followed by five in the US, as per a Kotak analyst note. The latest acquisition being an engineering R&D services provider, in-tech that is focused on the German automotive industry. The cost of the acquisition is pegged at $480 million (450 million euros).Similarly, Wipro’s largest acquisition in its history was in Europe. It acquired London-based global management and tech consultancy firm Capco for a consideration of $1.45 billion in 2021 to boost its presence in banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical. Wipro during the Q4 earnings also revealed that consulting business is seeing green shoots and Capco unit grew 6.6% sequentially, much higher than Wipro’s overall revenue growth at 0.01% QoQ.For the third largest IT major in India, HCLTech – the three major acquisitions that it has made in the last two years were all in Europe. It made its European acquisition last year when it bought German automotive engineering services company ASAP Group for $279 million. The other two acquisitions in 2022 were Starschema, a leading provider of data engineering services, based in Budapest, Hungary and Confinale AG, a Switzerland-based digital banking and wealth management consulting specialist.Fifth largest Indian IT major, Tech Mahindra’s acquisition of Europe-based CTC (Com Tec Co IT Ltd) in 2022 for $310 million, is the second-largest acquisition that the company has made after scam-hit Satyam in April 2010.Pareekh Jain, CEO, EIIRTrend “There is huge headroom for growth in Europe. But IT companies need language capabilities and local presence to penetrate the market. They are augmenting their capabilities across all service lines in Europe. For IT services, the US is the biggest market. But as far as ER&D (engineering and research and development) services is concerned, Europe is the largest amongst all geography.”Europe ER&D market size is $41 billion out of a total global $94 billion, highest in any geography. It is also fastest growing at 10% vs 8.5% globally, added Jain. And that’s one of the strong reasons for the majority of big ER&D M& As in Europe. There were more than 25 ER&D acquisitions in Europe in three years, he added.Peter Bendour Samuel, CEO, Everest Group, said, “Europe is an attractive market for Tech Services. It has grown faster than North America for 10 straight quarters and until the last two quarters it has been the fastest growing market in all the Geographies. Furthermore it is still well behind North America (NA) on digital transformation and is likely to remain an attractive market as European firms spend to catch up with their North American competitors. It also favors tech services firms with a strong domestic presence, hence the Indian companies are very active in looking for and acquiring European assets which will anchor their ongoing expansion in the region.” New Jersey based Cognizant, which has a majority of its employees based in India, acquired Mobica, an eastern European engineering service provider with 900 people, last year.Analysts say that India's largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) which is generally shy of inorganic route, hasn’t made any significant acquisitions in the last 10 years. But the IT bellwether has been active in acquiring captives of clients and its last major acquisition of client’s captive was its acquisition of 100% of the shares of Postbank Systems AG (PBS) from Deutsche Bank AG.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/europe-emerges-as-hotspot-for-indian-it-mas-tops-buy-chart/articleshow/109515130.cms
TCS,2024-04-22T10:28:00+05:30,Nikhil Agarwal,"FIIs raise bet on TCS, Infosys, 4 other IT stocks in Q4. Time for a U-turn?","FIIs raised stakes in multiple IT stocks in Q4, hoping for a turnaround in FY25. However, they sold IT stocks in April, leading to a 4.4% drop in the Nifty IT index. Various companies and sectors were involved in these transactions.","Hoping to see a turnaround of fortunes in FY25, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) raised stakes in TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro, Coforge and Persistent Systems in the March quarter. But as the macro environment remains uncertain with further challenges in the short run, dollar money is now having second thoughts.In the first fortnight of April, FIIs sold IT stocks worth around Rs 4,700 crore to buy power and banks. This comes after March shareholding pattern revealed that FII stake went up by 24 bps to 12.7% in TCS, 26 bps to 6.96% in Wipro, 41 bps to 34.11% in Infosys, 23 bps in HCL Tech and 96 bps to 35% in case of Coforge.During the quarter, FIIs were net sellers in stocks like LTTS, LTIMindtree, Mphasis and Tech Mahindra. On the other hand, mutual funds took a more bearish stance on the Indian IT sector in Q4 by cutting stakes in 6 out of top 10 stocks - Coforge, HCL Tech, Infosys, LTIMindtree, Persistent Systems and Tech Mahindra.Also read | Iran-Israel war or election jitters? Why FIIs decamped with Rs 20,000 crore in 4 daysCommon buyings by both MFs and FIIs during the quarter were TCS and Wipro. In the case of LTIMindtree and Tech Mahindra, both the big boys of Dalal Street were on the sell side.  However, after being a bull in Q4, FIIs were seen taking a U-turn in the first two weeks of April amid fading hopes of a recovery in FY25.While the names of IT stocks which FIIs sold this month are not known yet, experts believe it could be the Tier-I IT stocks. After falling 7.5% in March, the Nifty IT index is down about 4.4% so far in the month.Barring a small upside of 1% in TCS and 6% in Persistent, all 10 constituents of Nifty IT index have lost value so far in the year. LTIMindtree, Coforge and Mphasis have seen double-digit declines.What should investors do?While TCS management guided for FY25 revenue growth to outstrip FY24, Wipro guided for -1.5% to +0.5% IT Services revenue growth in Q1 FY25.Infosys' FY25 revenue guidance of 1-3% YoY in cc terms was so disappointing that Kotak Equities said it expects normalised growth only from FY26. Nomura lowered its FY25-26 EPS estimate by 2-3% driven by lower revenue and margin outlook.Many domestic investors are sounding bearish on the outlook for IT stocks for the next few months. We do not believe that they are at the end of the tunnel. It will take some more time, especially the BFSI segment which is the mainstay for most of our IT companies. Unless that picks up, I do not think they will have too much to talk about in terms of numbers. And there is so much change going on in the industry with generative AI and all of that. So, how these companies will play on those things, I think we will have to give some more time,  said Daljeet Singh Kohli of Vasuki India Fund.Global brokerage BNP Paribas, however, believes that while discretionary demand remains slow, the sector appears to have bottomed, and valuations are already pricing in most of the risks.(Data inputs: Ritesh Presswala)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

TCS,2024-04-22T06:30:00+05:30,Kumar Shankar Roy,ESG mutual funds: Why these MFs may not be the right choice for investors,"Having failed to beat even simpler fund categories, ESG funds may not be the right choice for investors.","The bull market rally that began after the Covid lows proved to be a turning point for ESG (environment, social, and governance) investing. Investors shifted their focus from how much money companies make to how they make it. In response, fund houses in India, like their global counterparts, launched a raft of ESG thematic offerings to capture the trend. However, three years down the line, most ESG funds have failed to generate superlative returns despite filling up portfolios with the so-called ‘do-gooders’ of the corporate terra firma. The category has struggled to beat one-year and three-year returns of simpler products, such as large-cap funds and flexi-cap funds.ESG investing is built on the way investee company treats the planet, cares about people, and is being governed. ESG-focused funds primarily invest in companies that are selected on ESG criteria as defined by their proprietary investment framework. The ESG theme garnered popularity in the post-Covid era, coinciding with the phase when investors sought a new plank to justify premium valuations of certain stocks. Between 2020 and 2021, eight new ESG funds were launched. In total, there are 10 ESG schemes today (eight actively managed and two passively managed) managing about Rs.11,000 crore investor assets.Active funds employ sector-level and stock-level screening to identify ESG-compliant companies. Companies are included in ESG portfolios based on strength in one or two ESG parameters, not necessarily all three. While ESG scores/risk scores are an integral part of the investment research process, funds are not restrained by them. In July 2023, market regulator Sebi allowed AMCs to launch multiple ESG schemes with different sub-strategies like exclusion, integration, best-in-class and positive screening, impact investing, sustainable objectives, and transition or transition-related investments. ESG funds are required to allocate a minimum 80% of total assets to equities, following their specified strategy.Following this, two ESG funds from ABSL and Axis specified that they would employ integration strategy, while two from ICICI Pru and Kotak said they would use exclusion strategy. In integration strategy, the fund considers ESG factors, along with financial ones, while deciding where to invest. On the other hand, those with exclusion strategy build portfolios by avoiding investments tied to certain ESG activities, business practices, or segments. Average performanceESG strategy is like a lion without claws as it has failed to boost the returns of ESG funds. Among the 20 equity fund categories, the ESG category with 33% absolute gain is ranked 16th in one-year time frame, while its 17.1% CAGR places it in a similar rank in the three-year time frame.In the one-year period, six out of eight actively managed ESG funds have lagged the benchmark Nifty 100 ESG Total Return Index. In the three-year period, four out of eight have shown underperformance. ESG funds from Quant and ICICI Pru have been notable exceptions to the category trend, but overall, the ESG fund category has underperformed simpler equity fund categories such as large-cap and flexi-cap baskets.From a portfolio standpoint, ESG funds are biased towards large-caps (55-79%). Except for Quant ESG’s concentrated portfolio (19 stocks), most funds have 40-55 stocks. The most frequently held stocks across ESG fund portfolios are ICICI Bank, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Maruti Suzuki, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance, RIL, HUL, and HCL Tech.ESG funds lagged largecap funds in past 3 years   109452148What explains ESG funds’ pedestrian returns? Top bank stocks and tech stocks have underperformed in the past year, causing a return drag, while some boost came from Maruti, Bharti, HCL Tech, Titan, Zomato, REC, L&T, TVS Motor, and Tata Motors.Experts say generating high returns from ESG portfolios could be a tough task in India if one were to stick to large caps. While US markets have hundreds of large caps, in India there are 100 large caps. “ESG funds add another layer of selection to choose ESG stocks as per their framework. This could leave them with a much smaller universe. In this situation, it’s all about assigning accurate weights to get outperformance,” says Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital.Other experts say the ESG theme could struggle due to premium valuations. “Themes such as ESG may find it difficult to beat broad market indices in some markets as the emphasis on ‘quality’ might mean holding stocks with a slightly premium valuation that can curtail the upside,” notes Vidya Bala, Co-Founder, PrimeInvestor.in.Due to portfolio positioning, most ESG funds haven’t been able to capture the market upsides in the last one- and three-year periods. However, the downside capture has been less than the market, staying true to expectations that firms scoring high in ESG offer a better cushion during declines.Investors should understand ESG data’s challenges and reporting. ESG scores aren’t mandatory and there’s no standardisation for formal disclosures. This gives rise to greenwashing examples, where some companies selectively disclose positive ESG practices while concealing negative aspects. This makes it challenging to gauge firms’ actual impact on ESG criteria and select them for fund portfolios. Hence, ESG theme investing is not for every investor, especially if your sole aim is high returns. Consider your goals, preferences and risk tolerance before going for ESG funds as they are yet to see a full market cycle.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//wealth/invest/esg-mutual-funds-why-these-mfs-may-not-be-the-right-choice-for-investors/articleshow/109452190.cms

TCS,2024-04-17T07:51:00+05:30,ET Bureau,"IT stocks slump as F&O bears mount bets on more downside fears, Infy results in focus","Indian IT stocks decline, affecting benchmarks. Concerns over US Fed rates and IT demand recovery persist. Infosys' guidance for FY25 awaited. Market cautious pre-results, with Nifty IT Index closing below 200 EMA.","Mumbai: Shares of Indian information technology (IT) companies slumped on Tuesday, dragging the benchmark indices lower, as traders built fresh bearish derivative bets on some stocks ahead of Infosys' fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Concerns that the US Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates in a hurry, which may delay demand recovery for IT services, also weighed on sentiment.Financial markets are shut on Wednesday for Ram Navami. The Nifty IT Index tumbled 2.6% on Tuesday to 33,574.9, while the benchmark Nifty fell 0.6%. Infosys was the top loser, dropping 3.6%. LTI Mindtree declined 3.1%, Wipro fell 2.3% and HCL Tech ended 2.1% lower. 109360882The drop in the stocks also resulted in the Nifty IT index closing below its 200 exponential moving average (EMA) - a key long-term trend indicator - of 33,900 for the first time since October, resulting in traders turning cautious. When a stock or an index closes below its 200 EMA, it is seen as bearish.  If the index sustains below this level, it indicates a medium- to long-term downtrend in the sector,  said Ruchit Jain, lead research analyst at brokerage 5Paisa.comForeign Portfolio Investors were net sellers of Indian stocks to the tune of ₹4,468 crore, while their domestic counterparts were buyers worth ₹2,040 crore.Investors are watching out for Infosys' revenue and margin growth guidance for FY25. The forecasts will give some insight into when demand in the US is expected to recover. We see IT stocks to be a market performer because there will be nothing special coming up in the results in the coming days,  said Apurva Sheth, head of research at Samco Securities.  IT had been undervalued earlier after which it has bounced back and is now going through a consolidation phase. 5Paisa.com's Jain said there was fresh build-up of bearish derivative bets in LTI Mindtree, Infosys, Mphasis, Wipro and Info Edge on Tuesday.Analysts predicted short-term gains in TCS after the company's fourth-quarter results announced on Friday were better than expected. However, the stock fell on Monday and Tuesday amid the weakness in the broader market triggered by the Iran-Israel conflict.  The fall in IT stocks is a result of increased geopolitical risks and has to do with valuation multiples,  Apurva Prasad, VP- institutional research (IT), HDFC Securities.  We think that growth and margins for the sector have bottomed out. Interest rate cuts by the US Fed are seen as one of the biggest triggers for IT stocks in India.Sheth advises investors to stick to large-cap stocks in IT.  We are not very bullish on the overall market and would advise investors to prefer TCS and HCL Tech over Wipro and Infosys in the space,  he said.The activity in IT stock options contracts suggests limited upside from current levels. There was call writing seen at higher levels in options data and call writers look more active than put writers in the space,  said Jain.

Continuing its downtrend for the third day running on Tuesday, the 30-share BSE Sensex tanked 456.10 points or 0.62 per cent to settle at 72,943.68. During the day, it slumped 714.75 points or 0.97 per cent to 72,685.03.  The market capitalisation (mcap) of BSE-listed companies was eroded by Rs 7,93,529.61 crore to Rs 3,94,25,823.46 (USD 4.75 trillion) in three days.  In the past three days, the BSE benchmark tanked 2,094.47 points or 2.79 per cent.   Markets extended their losing streak for a third straight session on the back of weak global cues as a sharp rise in US bond yields due to rising Middle East tensions has made equity markets less attractive and prompted investors to resort to profit-taking.   Investors are fearing that the ongoing conflict could fuel buoyancy in crude oil prices and in turn weigh on inflation,  Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, said.  From the Sensex basket, Infosys, IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra, Bajaj Finance, Tata Consultancy Services and Larsen & Toubro were the major laggards.  Titan Company, Hindustan Unilever, HDFC Bank, Maruti, Power Grid, Reliance Industries and ITC were the gainers.  In Asian markets, Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong settled lower.  European markets were quoting in the red. Wall Street ended in negative territory on Monday.   Escalating tension in the Middle East has turned sentiments sour leading to a rise in crude oil prices. Weak global cues and Rs 11,295 crore selling by FIIs in the last two days hurt domestic markets,  Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said.  Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 3,268 crore on Monday, according to exchange data.  Among the indices, IT declined 2.32 per cent, teck (2.09 per cent), bankex (0.50 per cent), metal (0.36 per cent), capital goods (0.26 per cent) and commodities (0.24 per cent).
