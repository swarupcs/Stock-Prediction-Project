It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks? Foreign funds’ gross purchases at record high of Rs 4 lakh crore in MarchTCS and Infosys' Q4 earnings expectationsAnalysts expect that TCS will demonstrate industry-leading growth in the March quarter, supported by the BSNL deal. Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

Indian giants like Met","US-based Dell’s memo to the effect that those working remotely won’t get promotions shows how the pendulum has swung from one end to the other across companies. The mid days of the pandemic saw companies vouching for work from home. And today from so-called ardent support for work from home (WFH), most companies are championing work from the office (WFO).As a report in Economic Times says, the Covi-19 pandemic necessitated a shift to remote work. Over the last year and more, companies have swung from flexible to firm on their return-to-office stance -- even informing WFH holdouts of stern action. The names include both Indian and well as global technology giants -- Facebook and Instagram-parent Meta, Amazon and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are among those that have warned workers of consequences for failure to comply with return-to-office directives.Most organisations are insisting on a return to office primarily because post-Covid hybrid working or WFH has created a fundamental disconnect in the ability to perform tasks that require collaboration, told a consultant to Economic Times. He, however, did not want to be named. Some companies have also cited data security as a reason for getting people to the office. For employees who do not follow, the new policy could play out by way of impacting ratings, promotions and career opportunitiesTCS send final call for employees to work from officeTata Consultancy Services (TCS) in February extended the period by which employees should return to office by another quarter, to March end, but informed them that this will be the last deadline for doing so. Failure to resume work from office (WFO) by then will lead to ""consequences,"" chief operating officer NG Subramaniam, told ET, citing work culture as well as security issues.""We are exercising patience but have taken a principled stand that employees have to get back to offices,"" he said. ""We have sent employees the final communication on this and if they do not, there will be consequences to face.""HCL warning to employeesIn February 2024, HCL Technologies announced that all employees in its Digital Foundation Services (DFS) division must work from the office at least three days a week, starting February 19, 2024.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

And today from so-called ardent support for work from home (WFH), most companies are championing work from the office (WFO).As a report in Economic Times says, the Covi-19 pandemic necessitated a shift to remote work. Over the last year and more, companies have swung from flexible to firm on their return-to-office stance -- even informing WFH holdouts of stern action. The names include both Indian and well as global technology giants -- Facebook and Instagram-parent Meta, Amazon and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are among those that have warned workers of consequences for failure to comply with return-to-office directives.Most organisations are insisting on a return to office primarily because post-Covid hybrid working or WFH has created a fundamental disconnect in the ability to perform tasks that require collaboration, told a consultant to Economic Times. He, however, did not want to be named. Some companies have also cited data security as a reason for getting people to the office. For employees who do not follow, the new policy could play out by way of impacting ratings, promotions and career opportunitiesTCS send final call for employees to work from officeTata Consultancy Services (TCS) in February extended the period by which employees should return to office by another quarter, to March end, but informed them that this will be the last deadline for doing so. Failure to resume work from office (WFO) by then will lead to ""consequences,"" chief operating officer NG Subramaniam, told ET, citing work culture as well as security issues.""We are exercising patience but have taken a principled stand that employees have to get back to offices,"" he said. ""We have sent employees the final communication on this and if they do not, there will be consequences to face.""HCL warning to employeesIn February 2024, HCL Technologies announced that all employees in its Digital Foundation Services (DFS) division must work from the office at least three days a week, starting February 19, 2024.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks? Foreign funds’ gross purchases at record high of Rs 4 lakh crore in MarchTCS and Infosys' Q4 earnings expectationsAnalysts expect that TCS will demonstrate industry-leading growth in the March quarter, supported by the BSNL deal. Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

Indian giants like Met","US-based Dell’s memo to the effect that those working remotely won’t get promotions shows how the pendulum has swung from one end to the other across companies. The mid days of the pandemic saw companies vouching for work from home. And today from so-called ardent support for work from home (WFH), most companies are championing work from the office (WFO).As a report in Economic Times says, the Covi-19 pandemic necessitated a shift to remote work.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms

It's expected to be a modest quarter for IT firms.As per an ET report, TCS will release its fourth quarter results on April 12, while Infosys will announce theirs on April 18.Overall, IT companies are expected to have a subdued performance in the March quarter, with no significant surprises expected. Nuvama predicts industry revenue growth to range between -1.5% and +4.5%, influenced by the gradual return of furloughs and reduced discretionary technology spending.However, the focus is primarily on the guidance for the current fiscal year (FY25), as the weak conclusion to FY24 and an uncertain demand environment may moderate initial forecasts for FY25 among most players.Also Read | Why are foreigners shopping for Indian stocks?

Additionally, the company's constant currency revenue growth is expected to outperform its peers sequentially during the March quarter.Meanwhile, Infosys could begin to witness a recovery in earnings from the first quarter of FY25, driven by expectations of significant ramp-ups in large deals.During the fourth quarter, Kotak Equities has projected a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter constant revenue growth for TCS, whereas Infosys might experience a decline of 1.5% on a sequential basis.The March quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Infosys. The sequential decline is expected due to reduced revenues from third-party software sales and weak discretionary spending.Regarding margins, TCS is expected to outperform its Bengaluru-based peer, with a sequential improvement likely aided by enhanced employee utilization and pyramid management.Kotak forecasts a 40 basis points decline in Infosys' EBIT margins due to the impact of wage revisions and a lack of leverage from growth.Deal wins for the fourth quarter are expected to be around $10 billion for TCS and approximately $3 billion for Infosys. In the December quarter, Infosys secured large deals worth $3.2 billion, while TCS boasted deals valued at $8.1 billion.Indian IT companies, including Infosys, which issue annual revenue growth guidelines, are likely to adopt a cautious approach in their guidance. This caution is due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent forecast cut by Accenture.Nomura anticipates that Infosys will guide for a 2-5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms, with an EBIT margin band of 20-22% for FY25.Also Read | Top SME IPOs based on returns: Why holding smaller stocks for a longer duration makes senseStock outlook The IT sector has experienced significant volatility in recent months, marked by a strong rally in December and January followed by a sharp correction in March.CLSA India has recently upgraded its rating on a few frontline tech stocks and raised price targets for some of them.

","MUMBAI: Tata Sons is looking to raise about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) from selling the shares of its cash cow unit Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Tuesday as it plans to reduce debt on its books.The holding company of the $150-billion salt-to-software conglomerate aims to restructure its balance sheet to avoid a mandatory public listing under RBI’s ‘upper layer’ NBFC norms. The ‘upper layer’ NBFC tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified.108598663According to Tata Sons’ FY23 report, it has debt of Rs 21,909 crore and cash & bank balances of Rs 451 crore on its books. RBI rules require Tata Sons, which is registered as a core investment company (CIC) with the banking regulator, to be listed by Sept 2025. But the company, controlled by a group of public foundations, Tata Trusts, has been exploring options to avoid the IPO. According to RBI, for the CIC status, a firm has to meet two conditions: First, it has to have an asset size of more than Rs 100 crore, and second, it has to have public funds. If either of the two conditions fail, then it cannot continue to be registered as a CIC with the regulator.Tata Sons’ assets are mainly its investments in operating companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and they are worth more than Rs 100 crore. According to its FY23 report, the book value of its investments was Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, Tata Sons is looking to retire borrowings by becoming debt free, which will enable it to deregister as a CIC from RBI.The move will help Tata Sons to ‘neatly sidestep’ RBI’s rules, freeing itself from being considered as a CIC and an ‘upper layer’ NBFC, exempting it from going for an IPO, TOI had reported in its March 8 edition. In 2017, Tata Sons had converted itself to a privately held company from a public one amid a boardroom battle between then chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Trusts.Tata Sons has mandated foreign broking majors Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan India to sell up to 2.34 crore TCS shares, representing 0.65% of the company for about Rs 9,362 crore ($1.1 billion) through block deals on Tuesday. It has set a floor price of Rs 4,001 apiece for the TCS shares, a 3.7% discount to the stock’s Monday closing, term sheet for the deal showed. After the transaction, Tata Sons will hold a little less than 72% in TCS, down from 72.4% it was holding as of end-Dec 2023, shareholding data on BSE showed.Once this block trade is completed, at an aggregate value of Rs 9,362 crore, it will be the second biggest block deal in the Indian market in 2024. Last week, global tobacco major BAT, which is the biggest shareholder in ITC, sold a 3.5% stake in the tobacco-to-FMCG major for nearly Rs 17,500 crore.Even as Tata Sons looks to avoid the IPO, its subsidiary Tata Capital is gearing up for an RBI-mandated IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-looks-to-sell-rs-9000-crore-tcs-shares-to-reduce-debt/articleshow/108598634.cms
tcs,2024-03-18T11:34:00+05:30,TOI Business Desk,Brace for disappointment! Indian IT sector employees likely to see flat salary hikes and deferred increments this year,India Business News: India's $250 billion IT sector is expected to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to global challenges impacting company operations. Average salary ,"Indian IT sector employees should brace for flat salary hikes and deferred increments in 2024. India's information technology (IT) sector, valued at $250 billion, is predicted to witness stagnant salaries in 2024 due to the impact of global challenges on company operations. The sector, known for being a major employer in the country, is also expected to experience a slowdown in hiring activities.According to data sourced by ET from a leading hiring firm, IT companies are likely to offer average salary appraisals ranging from 8.4% to 9% this year, similar to the increments seen in 2023 at 8.5-9.1%. Munira Loliwala, AVP - strategy and growth at Teamlease Digital, mentioned that most companies are likely to defer these increments to the end of the first fiscal quarter, a deviation from the usual practice of salary hikes in April.The focus within the IT sector currently revolves around stabilizing headcounts, with projections indicating either flat or negative growth in headcount for the year. While there was a gradual increase in salary increments from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.7% in 2022, it decreased to 8.5-9.1% in 2023.Loliwala highlighted that many large multinational companies implemented moderate hikes towards the end of 2023, averaging around 7% for most roles. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and TCS followed different approaches regarding pay hikes, with some opting to skip or selectively roll out increments based on employee tenure.For example, Infosys announced raises averaging under 10% in December, effective from November, with certain employees receiving minimal single-digit increases.Infosys opted not to provide raises to junior or mid-level staff, while HCLTech and Wipro excluded employees in mid- or senior-level positions. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) implemented salary hikes ranging from 6-8%, with exceptional performers receiving double-digit increments.IT firms have been contending with a significant downturn in revenue growth and a decrease in headcount over recent quarters, with major players like TCS and Infosys abstaining from campus recruitment last year.The decline in global demand amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation in developed markets has led to an unprecedented slowdown in technology spending. Consequently, IT companies are seeking ways to enhance gross margins, with employee expenses representing the largest portion, comprising 50-60% of total expenditures.Loliwala pointed out that Global Capability Centres (GCCs) of multinational corporations are influencing the subdued hiring trends in the Indian IT sector. GCCs in India are expected to witness average salary hikes of 10-10.1% this year, showcasing their impact on the industry.Reports suggest that GCCs currently employ approximately 1.66 million individuals, with a majority consisting of tech talent. Additionally, a significant number of individuals in the sector are engaging in certification and training programs to upskill themselves, aiming for better appraisals and career growth.The rise of tech talent in Banking and Financial Services is identified as a key factor contributing to higher salary increments within the sector, with projections indicating upper-end hikes of around 11.1% this year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-disappointment-indian-it-sector-employees-likely-to-see-flat-salary-hikes-and-deferred-increments-this-year/articleshow/108577841.cms
