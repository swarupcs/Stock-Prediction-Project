The bank, that recently overtook Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. to become the third largest private lender in India, is targeting mid-sized companies in this area, the fastest growing business in its corporate banking division. It sees this as an “under-served” market by global banks, according to Rajiv Anand, Axis’ deputy managing director.  Axis is focused on companies from countries like South Korea, Japan, US, Germany, Italy and France that have good ties with India. Getting the inside track into South Korean and Japanese firms has proven tougher however, due to language and cultural barriers, according to Anand.  The bank is seeking to bring on board expatriates who can help make connections with companies and their executives, Anand said. So far, it has hired a Korean expatriate, based in the southern city of Bangalore, and a Japanese, who was relocated to Mumbai.  Financial firms in India have been on a hiring spree, though the country doesn’t have the depth of domestic talent that other more established markets do. Headhunters see the likes of investment banks seeking to bring professionals who carved out careers abroad back to India and Bloomberg Intelligence said finance professionals in the country may be in line for a 10% pay rise this year, outstripping rival locations in Asia.  Axis is ranked second behind HDFC Bank Ltd. for arranging local currency loans in India so far this year, and fifth place for foreign currency loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/axis-bank-brings-expats-to-india-in-push-to-woo-global-firms-12716817.html

axis,2024-04-22T09:15:43+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Axis Bank's plans to raise equity capital surprise Nomura,"Axis Bank’s CET1 was at 13.7% as of December quarter against regulatory minimum of 8%. Other private sector banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are at 16 percent, 16.3 percent and 20.1 percent respectively.  ","Nomura Research has expressed surprise at the prospect of Axis Bank initiating an equity capital raise, especially because of the management's stance against raising capital in the near future.  &quot;We note that the approval sought at the board meeting may also just be an enabling provision (which is a procedural approval taken by several banks from their respective boards at the beginning of a new FY), though Axis has historically not done this. We await clarity on this along with the results on 24 April,&quot; the foreign brokerage said in a note.  Axis Bank’s CET1 was at 13.7 percent as of December quarter against regulatory minimum of 8 percent. Other private sector banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are at 16 percent, 16.3 percent and 20.1 percent, respectively.  &quot;Our calculation suggests that for every 100bp of extra CET1, Axis Bank will have to  raise Rs 9,900 crore in equity capital. This would result in a negative FY26 RoE impact of 90bps. In such a scenario, FY26 EPS gets diluted by 3 percent while the FY26 BVPS would see 1.5 percent accretion,&quot; Nomura said.  In an exchanges filing on April 18, Axis Bank has notified that at its board meeting on April 24 (for Q4 FY24 results), it will also be evaluating a potential equity capital raise via QIP/ADR issuance/preferential allotment ‘at an appropriate time’.  Nomura said the near-term risk of increased equity supply could weigh on share price performance, especially given recent significant block deals (December 2023 and April 2024). It awaits clarification on whether the approval from the board meeting is merely procedural, as seen in past fiscal years, or if it holds more substantial implications. Further details are anticipated from management post the April 24 results.  Axis Bank remains a top pick for Nomura. They will closely monitor any loan growth pressures stemming from deposit mobilisation challenges, particularly given its high loan-to-deposit ratio (93 percent as of Q3 FY24, compared to 80 percent for the sector overall).  Despite this, Nomura believes that current valuations account for much of these concerns, with Axis Bank trading at 1.5x FY26 book value per share (BVPS) compared to 1.8x/2.1x for HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, respectively. Despite underperforming the broader Bank Nifty index by 6 percent year-to-date, Nomura expects Axis Bank to achieve around 18 percent return on equity (RoE) over FY25-26.

If a third of these orders start using Flipkart’s UPI, it is likely to do 50 million transactions in a month.","E-commerce major Flipkart, which launched its unified payments interface (UPI) handle in March, is off to a flying start with the company registering more than five million transactions worth Rs 200 crore in the month through the platform.  To be sure @fkaxis handle was available to limited users a couple of months before launch to test stability as per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) regulations.  March was the first full month of Flipkart’s UPI offering being available to all Android users. The iOS version is set to be launched in a couple of months.  Flipkart did not say how many users signed up for its UPI handles. The Bengaluru-based e-commerce major is offering minor rewards for using its UPI and it is not clear whether the good start is because of the cashbacks. However, once a customer signs up for the Flipkart handle, the payment option is likely to be displayed prominently on the checkout page for further transactions. Most merchant platforms love UPI because there is no merchant discount rate (MDR) or payment commission for UPI, unlike card transactions.  To put the numbers in context, mobile payments firm Mobikwik did around eight million transactions in March, while other fintech apps such as Groww and Jupiter did less than seven and six million transactions. These companies' UPI products have been around for a lot longer.  Amazon Pay, which has been around for five years, notches up somewhere between 50 million to 65 million transactions a month. To reach around 10 percent of that in the first month of full-scale launch seems like a decent outcome.  Flipkart’s UPI usage is likely to be much higher than that of Amazon Pay UPI in the long run, said an industry executive, who did not wish to be identified.  “Amazon targets the premium customers where the credit card penetration is high. Flipkart is more popular among tier 2 cities, towns and villages and will likely see a lot more UPI usage,” the executive added.  Flipkart has around 500 million users and the company does around five million orders  a day. Even if a third of these orders start using Flipkart’s UPI, it is likely to do 50 million transactions in a month.  The role and rise of UPI  UPI is the most popular digital payments system in the country, with around 75 percent of all online transactions executed through the platform. It makes sense for an e-commerce company with billions in sales every year to have its own UPI platform. For instance, Amazon Pay UPI is used for around 50 percent of all transactions made on the e-commerce platform.  Going to a third-party payment app increases the chances of failure. Having its own UPI handle will reduce payment failures for the vast majority of such transactions.  “We are seeing an encouraging response from our customers. UPI as an instrument has improved accessibility and convenience for both commerce and non-commerce transactions, and Flipkart's goal is to ensure we provide the same convenience on our platform as well,” Flipkart said in a statement to Moneycontrol.  For in-house payments  Flipkart’s main purpose in launching UPI is to cater to in-house UPI payment requirements rather than being used as a third-party payment app.  “We are not trying to be the largest payments company in India. Again, no such ambition or don't even have the bandwidth or appetite to do anything close to that,” Kalyan Krishnamurthy told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interaction a few months ago.  An e-commerce app being used as a pure-play payment app is likely to be clunky and heavy for payment purposes. This has been one of the biggest reasons why Amazon Pay UPI did not scale despite hefty cashbacks and offers.  Flipkart’s rise comes at a time when there are concerns that UPI is an entrenched duopoly, with Walmart-owned PhonePe and Google Pay cornering more than 85 percent of the market. Meanwhile, another large player, Paytm, has seen its market share drop from around 13 percent last year to around 9 percent in March because of regulatory action against its associate company, Paytm Payments Bank.  Incidentally, PhonePe, which is the market leader in UPI with around 50 percent market share, was incubated in Flipkart and hived off in 2020. Flipkart always wanted a payment platform of its own but did not launch any separate product because of PhonePe. But with the latter being hived off, it has re-entered the space.  Interestingly, Flipkart cofounder Sachin Bansal’s fintech app Navi is also offering rewards and cashbacks for using UPI.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/flipkarts-upi-off-to-a-flying-start-in-march-12673291.html

Once the index closes above 22,600, one can expect a march towards 22,700-22,800.","The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent for the seventh time in a row on April 5.

The US central bank indicated three rate cuts this year with experts expecting the first one around end of June or early second half of 2024.

With the hope of normal monsoon this year and continuing food price uncertainties along with rising oil prices (Brent crude futures traded at $91 a barrel, up 11 percent in last one month), geo-political tensions and volatility in financial markets, the central bank expects the CPI inflation at 4.9 percent in Q1FY25 and 3.8 percent in Q2FY25, while the last reading was 5.1 percent in January-February (softening from 5.7 percent in December 2023) and core inflation at 3.3 percent in February as against 3.6 percent in January.  &quot;Projections of real GDP growth for FY24-25 at 7 percent and CPI inflation at 4.5 percent for the year along with strong manufacturing and services PMI numbers and healthy corporate and banking balance sheet instills confidence of the resilience of Indian economy,&quot; Raghvendra Nath, MD at Ladderup Wealth Management said, adding if rural demand strengthens and there are no adverse surprises in inflation from food or crude oil prices, private consumption is expected to rise, further aiding the growth trajectory.  However, he feels the timing and extent of rate cuts remain dependent on announcement by global central banks and the CPI aligning with RBI’s 4 percent target on a sustained basis.  The market turned volatile around 22,500 on the Nifty 50 as it seems to have priced in the non-event. Now, the all focus will be on the corporate earnings that will start next week, and in case the index gives a strong close above 22,600, then the further march towards 22,700-22,800 area is likely on cards, with support at 22,300, experts said.  &quot;The RBI MPC meet has become a non-event for the market as everything was on expected lines with no new surprises,&quot; Sheersham Gupta, director and senior technical analyst at Rupeezy, said. He maintained a mild bullish stance for the Nifty, especially the financials, for the short to medium term.  On the upside, the immediate resistance for the Nifty stands at 22,600 and, if surpassed, the index may potentially reach levels around 22,750, he feels.  The rate-sensitive stocks were mixed with the Bank Nifty rising 0.4 percent and Realty index jumping 1.5 percent, but Auto was down third of a percent at the time of writing this article.  Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 rate sensitive stocks from experts with a 3-4-week perspective. The stock price of April 4 is considered for the calculation of returns:  Expert: Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,527.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 | Target: Rs 1,620 | Return: 6 percent  Recently, HDFC Bank experienced a significant upward movement following a period of consolidation between Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,475 and is now trading above Rs 1,530. Moreover, the daily stochastic indicator has shown a bullish reversal from just above the oversold threshold of 25, indicating positive momentum.  This breakout is further supported by substantial trading volume. Additionally, the stock closed above the weekly R5 resistance camarilla Pivot (Rs 1,487.9), suggesting continued bullish sentiment. Consequently, we recommend traders/investors to consider buying within Rs 1,500-1,530 range, targeting Rs 1,620, with a stop-loss placed near Rs 1,465 on a daily closing basis.    AU Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 621 | Stop-Loss: Rs 568 | Target: Rs 720 | Return: 16 percent  AU Small Finance Bank reached a peak around Rs 813 on January 8, 2024, but then experienced a decline of approximately 32 percent. However, in the past two weeks, the stock has shown a significant recovery and is currently trading near Rs 620 mark, indicating a bullish sentiment.  On the indicator side, the weekly Scale Stochastics indicator has identified a &quot;hidden Bull Divergence&quot; close to its previous low point recorded on March 20, 2023 (as shown on the chart). This divergence suggests the possibility of upward momentum and indicates a potential bullish sentiment.  Therefore, investors may consider adding long positions in the range of Rs 600-625, with an upside target set at Rs 720. It's recommended to set a stop-loss near Rs 568 on a daily closing basis to manage risk.    Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,063 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025 | Target: Rs 1,130 | Return: 6 percent  Since peaking around Rs 1,130 mark on March 6, 2024, Axis Bank has undergone a significant downturn, experiencing a notable decline of approximately 9 percent. However, in the following six trading sessions, Axis Bank has shown resilience, avoiding further declines and instead consolidating within a range spanning from Rs 1,040 to Rs 1,080.  Interestingly, support is also evident near Rs 1,050 levels due to Fibonacci ratio clustering, and daily stochastics indicate a &quot;hidden Bull Divergence,&quot; adding to the bullish sentiment in the stock (refer to the chart).  Therefore, investors may contemplate adding long positions within Rs 1,050-1,070 range, with an upside target set at Rs 1,130. To manage risk, it is advisable to set a stop-loss near Rs 1,025 on a daily closing basis.    Expert: Ashish Kyal, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors  Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 607 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 670 | Return: 10 percent  As shown on the below chart, Canara Bank have shown an excellent rise and prices are moving precisely within the upward sloping channel. We have identified the 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) which has successfully supported rallies in the past and dips towards this average have acted as a great buying opportunity as major lows have formed near this average.  So as long as price holds above it, the trend is likely to remain bullish. Support as per this is near Rs 550 levels. Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has also shown bullish crossover which is acting as a double confirmation.  However, looking at the overall rise, buy on dips looks prudent strategy for better risk reward for the target of Rs 670 which is also a channel resistance as long as Rs 550 holds on the downside.    Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,410 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,195 | Target: Rs 3,150 | Return: 31 percent  In the previous session, Godrej Properties closed on a flat note. Stock is currently facing hurdle near previous swing high which is near Rs 2,540 levels. A decisive breakout above it can result into fresh rise in this stock.  Stock is following classic Elliott wave theory. Wherein, currently wave 5 of primary wave (3) is moving on the upside. As per guidelines wave 3 is considered as a strongest one. So further rise is expected in this stock once it breaches above Rs 2,540 level for the target of Rs 3,150 levels or higher. Key support is at Rs 2,195 levels.  LIC Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 644 | Stop-Loss: Rs 610 | Target: Rs 725 | Return: 13 percent  LIC Housing Finance is currently trading at important juncture. In previous session, there is minor rejection from the highs. Now acceptance back above Rs 661 followed by Rs 670 will indicate a strong positive breakout which will open the targets for Rs 725 levels.  Since March 21 not a single candle has given closed below previous day's low which keeps overall tone on the positive side. ADX (average directional index) is showing readings of 27 suggesting that momentum is picking up.  So, a breach above Rs 670 resistance level is must for further bullish momentum to continue with the target of Rs 725 level as long as Rs 610 holds on the downside.    Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, HOD - Research at GEPL Capital  City Union Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 154 | Stop-Loss: Rs 143 | Target: Rs 177 | Return: 15 percent  The City Union Bank weekly chart reveals a consolidation phase, with recent indications of a turnaround from a support zone, potentially marking a sustained reversal. This reversal is supported by increased volume participation, evident from the surge above the crucial 21-week average.  On the daily scale, the stock is establishing higher highs and higher lows, delineating a short-term uptrend that aligns with the broader timeframe.  Furthermore, City Union Bank is currently maintaining levels above key moving averages such as the 12-week and 26-week EMAs, signaling a trend improvement. The RSI above 60 and bullish crossovers further underscore the positive momentum.  Looking ahead, it's reasonable to anticipate continued upward movement in the stock, with a potential target price of Rs 177. It's advisable to set a stop-loss at Rs 143 on a closing basis to manage risk effectively.    Jana Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 467 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 542 | Return: 16 percent  JSFB (Jana Small Finance Bank) is displaying a consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the daily scale, indicating strong momentum and forming an IPO base as it approaches its all-time high.  Following a reversal candlestick on the weekly scale, the stock experienced a significant turnaround, reflecting positive sentiment and maintaining levels above the 12-day exponential moving average, signifying an improvement in trend.  Moreover, on the weekly timeframe, JSFB has demonstrated rapid retracement, with a four-week downtrend (from Rs 466 to Rs 368) being reversed in just two weeks, underscoring robust price action and signaling a potential upward trajectory.  Looking ahead, it is reasonable to anticipate that the upward movement will continue, potentially reaching Rs 542 level. It is advisable to set a stop-loss at Rs 430 on a closing basis to manage risk.  State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 759 | Stop-Loss: Rs 700 | Target: Rs 900 | Return: 19 percent  Since June 2020, SBI has demonstrated a strong price structure characterized by a rising trend. On the monthly scale, bullish price action has been evident, with the stock forming a Rally Base Rally pattern. Notably, in the prior month, a Doji candlestick has formed, suggesting a base, and indicating a potential rally ahead according to this price action pattern. On the weekly scale, February 2024 have shown polarity followed by impulse momentum, signaling a continuation of the upward trajectory.  SBI has consistently traded above important averages such as the 12-week and 26-week moving averages, indicating a positive trend. Additionally, the MACD study shows increasing values in the positive territory, further reinforcing the bullish momentum.  Furthermore, on the ratio chart of SBI against Nifty, polarity observed from the 2022 swing indicates a continuation of its outperformance.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 900. The bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 700 level.  Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, senior technical research analyst at HDFC Securities  HUDCO: Buy | LTP: Rs 207 | Stop-Loss: Rs 193 | Target: Rs 230 | Return: 11 percent  The weekly timeframe chart of this Housing &amp;amp; Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) indicates sharp upside bounce so far this week. After shifting in to a downward correction amidst larger range movement in the last couple of months, the stock price is currently in an attempt of decisive upside breakout of the said range around Rs 202-205 levels.  The stock price on the smaller timeframe has moved above the hurdle of down sloping trend line around Rs 198-200 levels. The volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication.  Buying can be initiated in HUDCO at CMP (Rs 207.15), add more on dips down to Rs 200, wait for the upside target of Rs 230 in the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stoploss of Rs 193.    Indiabulls Real Estate: Buy | LTP: Rs 135.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 125 | Target: Rs 149 | Return: 10 percent  After showing a downward correction with high volatility in the last 5-6 weeks, the real estate stock - Indiabulls Real Estate - has witnessed a sharp upmove so far this week. The bullish chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact as per weekly timeframe chart and present upmove in the stock price could be in line with new higher top of the sequence.  Weekly 10 and 20 period EMAs (exponential moving average) are intact and they have been offering supports during minor dips in the stock price over the period of time. Weekly 14 period RSI has turned up above crucial upper 60 levels and the volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price. This is positive indication and signal more upside for the stock price in the near term.  One may look to buy Indiabulls Real Estate at CMP (Rs 135.55), add more on dips down to Rs 129 and wait for the upside target of Rs 149 in the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 125.

axis,2024-04-04T16:27:00+05:30,S.N.Thyagarajan,Zee-Sony merger: NCLAT to decide next course of action in appeal on April 15,"IDBI bank and Axis bank urged NCLAT to adjourn the case pending till the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) decided the Zee's plea to enforce the merger. However, Zee argued that the pendency of the plea in NCLT will have no bearing on the present case and urged to NCLAT to continue hearing the case","The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on April 4 indicated that it will on April 15 pass an order on whether the challenges to legal sanction of the Zee-Sony merger could be heard when the merger itself has been called off.  IDBI bank and Axis bank urged NCLAT to adjourn the case pending till the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) decided on Zee's plea to enforce the merger. However, Zee argued that the pendency of the plea in NCLT will have no bearing on the present case and urged to NCLAT to continue hearing the case.  Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Venkatraman, who appeared for IDBI Bank, argued that the outcome of Zee's plea in NCLT will have bearing on the case as it will decide the future of the merger. However, senior advocate Arun Kathpalia who appeared for Zee, argued that while the case in NCLAT is an appeal against the sanction to Zee-Sony merger, the case in NCLT deals with the implementation of the merger.  The NCLAT, on hearing both the parties, recorded the argument advanced in the case and indicated that an order on the future course of action would be passed on April 15.  IDBI Bank, IDBI Trusteeship and Axis Trusteeship challenged the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) order from August granting a legal sanction to the merger.  On January 22, Sony called off the merger. The move was in part because Zee failed to meet some financial terms of the deal and come up with a plan to address them. Zee denied the allegations and accused the Japanese company of &quot;bad faith&quot; in calling off the merger.  A litigation asking Sony to enforce the merger is currently pending at the NCLT in Mumbai.   NCLAT litigation so far:  On December 15, the NCLAT refused to grant a stay on the Zee-Sony merger plan. The NCLAT noted that while the merger is subject to orders of the court, they cannot stay the same without hearing the case on merits. However, not much has transpired in the case since then owing to the termination of the merger.  The NCLT had on August 10 approved the merger of Zee Entertainment and Sony Pictures Networks India, paving the way for the creation of a $10-billion media giant in the country.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/zee-sony-merger-nclat-to-decide-next-course-of-action-in-appeal-on-april-15-12576081.html
axis,2024-04-03T07:00:34+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan," Exclusive Interview: “Next 3-6 months will tell us how the entire business with Paytm pans out,” says...","Chaudhry said the RBI’s unhappiness with the rising exposure of banks to NBFCs arises from the fact that, in some cases, lending through fintechs or NBFCs happens without banks taking ownership","Axis Bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Chaudhry on 2 April said India’s economy is doing well, backed by strong government spending, even as private sector investments are also showing signs of a pickup.  “Generally the economy is doing quite well, I mean, with the kind of spending which the government is doing and the kind of spending they are talking about, it is quite incredible. Private side has started talking about capex,” Chaudhry said in an interview on 2 April.  Asked about his views on the upcoming general elections, Chaudhry said India’s banking system is pinning hopes on policy stability from the centre, but macro factors and growth trends need to be monitored.  On the bank’s recent partnerships with Paytm, Chaudhry said the bank is working with the fintech company in three areas, including the UPI business and also as a nodal account manager for merchants transactions and will have to wait for the next 3-6 months to see how the business partnership will pan out.  In the past five years at Axis, Chaudhry launched several initiatives, from transforming the tech platforms to changing the way fresh business is acquired. Under Chaudhry’s watch, Axis Bank acquired Citibank’s retail business in India in 2023 in what could be termed as a landmark deal for the bank’s operations in the country.  In a freewheeling chat, Chaudhry said the Axis-Citi retail integration is happening smoothly and touched on a range of important issues, including the bank’s future growth plans and aggressive push to garner deposits through using a mix of physical branches and digital channels.  Edited excerpts:  General elections are around the corner. What impact do you anticipate this will have on the banking sector?  The expectation is that there will be policy stability in terms of how things pan out over a period of time. With that stability in mind, we have to worry more about some of the other things such as deposit growth and credit growth and things like that rather than really worrying about whether things will change at the central government level. Also, there are too many global macro issues that could impact India. I would say that would be more worrisome rather than change at the central government level.  &amp;nbsp;  You have a strict banking regulator in RBI…  &amp;nbsp;  Yes, the regulator wants us to work in a particular way. That’s the job of the regulator to make us work in a particular direction.  &amp;nbsp;  You have now completed 5-1/2 years as CEO. What were your biggest challenges?  &amp;nbsp;  When I came in, I kind of learned that there are some things you need fixing. One was we had asset quality issues. Second, we had legacy technology systems. It’s not that our technology was not good. But in quite a few cases, our technology across various platforms and businesses was lagging behind others we wanted to compete with. Third, even in terms of process efficiency, we were lagging behind. Fourth, we were not necessarily a conservative financial institution. It had a lot to do with the culture, how we thought, and how we were organised.  &amp;nbsp;  What parts of the earlier business worked and what didn’t?  So we were aggressive in certain areas we should not have been. Some of these things evolve over time. So you may have taken deposits from people who are necessarily not the best people to take deposits from. You do businesses which you necessarily should not be doing, which don’t give you the right return and so on and so forth. So, as a result, we had to change the culture a little bit, and these are the businesses that we will not do. We are not going to be interested in something like this.  And secondly it was also important to raise the aspiration level of the bank that we can become a leader. Why are we feeling good being number three? So this cultural change was in my mind the most important thing and it is still an ongoing process. We’ll do things to become a leader. We’ll also start doing things that matter in the long run.  We have stopped worrying about our quarterly numbers. We have stopped worrying about what will happen in the short term.  &amp;nbsp;  Has this approach helped position you ahead of the competition?   &amp;nbsp;  We see some institutions following us and doing what we do, in the sense that earlier, we were just following what others were doing. Now, in some cases, we are ahead of them.  &amp;nbsp;  How are you tackling the challenge of deposit mobilisation?  &amp;nbsp;  We used to be known as a bank, which was doing very well on the deposit side generally, right? Over time, we lost the crown on deposits. Over the last three years, if you look at the data, our deposit growth on saving accounts, current accounts and term deposits generally compares very well to the two institutions we compare ourselves to. We have not beaten them, but we are very much in the same zone or slightly ahead of them overall. Citibank acquisition has obviously helped us, but I am just comparing like-to-like, and I think we have been in the same zone. The franchise has been built over a period of time, but it still needs some work.  &amp;nbsp;  How do you look at this issue from a competition point of view?  &amp;nbsp;  For example, our inroads into the corporate salary business overall are lower in comparison to what HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have achieved over a period of time. We penetrated it late. Maybe we penetrated it in the wrong way, whatever the reasons might be, we need to improve the quality. That is one of the reasons why we bought Citibank. Also, we have been working on a project called Triumph for a long period of time, and we know it is a very, very important project. The project is all about 50 people deployed full time on just this assignment alone, from various levels in the bank handpicked by us.  &amp;nbsp;  So, what is different now?  &amp;nbsp;  Earlier, our pitch on deposits invariably was a pricing-related pitch. Now, our pitches are around our relationship and services and products rather than price. So, this is a cultural change, and it takes time. So, there’s been a calculated, calibrated effort across the franchise to ensure that we can reduce the cost of deposits, reduce the yield rates, change the pitch, and change the culture. It’s like a moving ship, and you’re trying to change so many things at the same time. So, you have to do it at a certain pace because if you push the pace beyond a point, it can create a bigger problem. Our view has always been that on the lending side, we need to grow 400 to 600 basis points more than the market. To support that growth, our deposit growth also has to be similar.  &amp;nbsp;  But why is there a deposit constraint to begin with?  &amp;nbsp;  The constraint in the deposit growth has been the tight liquidity by RBI. During Covid, they had released the liquidity quite a bit, but post-Covid they are managing it in a manner that the liquidity will kind of keep getting squeezed out of the market. If RBI keeps tight liquidity, deposits will remain constrained.  &amp;nbsp;  How are your digital banking channels doing?  &amp;nbsp;  If you look at our mobile app, it is rated 4.8, both on the Apple and Google Play store. We were the first ones to set up a separate digital banking unit. Others are also doing the same now. Most of our platforms are doing much better. We have a new platform for wholesale and SMEs. I’m not saying everything has been fixed, but they are seeing a different version of Axis, and we need to keep at it. A lot of work still needs to be done.  &amp;nbsp;  Is it fair to say that your deposit accretion strategy is centred on the 5,200 physical branches?    &amp;nbsp;  We have launched OPEN all-in-one, which is a big part of what we have been working on. Ultimately, all of us want to gain liabilities at scale digitally. When we launched OPEN on the digital side, it was a step in that direction. We want OPEN to be seen as a brand in itself, and we are working towards it. Again, It is a long haul, but we want to increase the scalability of our liability franchise digitally as well. That’s very important for us.  &amp;nbsp;  The wholesale side also contributes to deposits. Our SME side contributes to deposits. The branch banking has a big role to play. And we believe that today’s customers, even though they might be quite digitally savvy and access banking services mainly through digital channels, still want a physical presence.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  RBI has very clearly given a signal on the unsecured loans. What has changed at Axis after this?  &amp;nbsp;  Yes, obviously, RBI has given a signal. That very clearly means that if you attach more capital to any asset class, your returns on that business will go down. So, in a deposit-constrained environment, how we go about it is that we look at the businesses that give us the highest return and then which give us the lowest returns based on the current capital requirements as they exist. And then, we decide who will get the higher share of the deposits to be allocated to the various asset classes.  &amp;nbsp;  As far as unsecured is concerned, 77% of the total retail book is secured, and the remaining is unsecured. Most of our lending is still to existing bank customers. We have not changed our risk guardrails to increase the size of the business. The size of our personal loan business has gone up. But it has gone up because we have re-looked at our customer journeys. We have re-looked at our distributor journeys. We have re-looked at how we can attract more customers to come to us rather than going to some other entity. We are watching our data very, very closely.  &amp;nbsp;  What kind of loan mix are you looking at?  &amp;nbsp;  So, we expect both. See, in a deposit-constrained environment, sometimes some bets are off because we have limited options in terms of what we can do. Is mortgage the right business to do? It may not be. If the only relationship we have with the customer is a mortgage, and we are lending to them at 8.5%, it does not make sense. We should be able to cross-sell. In a healthy deposit-growing environment, you want everything to grow at a certain pace. But, in a deposit-constrained environment, maybe some asset classes will grow faster than others. So, we don’t want to start predicting which will grow by how much. Our expectation is that the retail business will be in the zone of 55% to 60%, and the wholesale will be the balance.  &amp;nbsp;  Is there a conscious strategy to grow the retail book?  &amp;nbsp;  Again, we are not putting any restraints on any of them. Our restraints are on capital and return dividends. So, if tomorrow wholesale stops making money, we cannot let it grow. If, with a client, the only thing we do is lending, it may not make sense for us in a deposit-constrained environment. So, we need to be careful and get the right kind of yield from a particular customer. That’s how we go about it, and that’s why we don’t put numbers around some of these things.  &amp;nbsp;  You have taken over some parts of the Paytm business. How has that been going so far for you?  So, for Paytm, there were a couple of things which they had to manage very quickly. One was to obviously set up a nodal account, which was with the bank. They opened the nodal account with us and I think they opened it with another bank as well because having one bank does not make sense. So, a lot of flows have started in that account.  &amp;nbsp;  Second is that they had the Paytm handle, and they had to ensure that they tie up with some bank to be able to operate that. Again, they have tied up with 2 banks. There is one primary bank, we have the second bank. Third, they had to do the same thing with the merchants, because they had a lot of business with the merchants. And there again, I think we are one of the two.  The fourth was the FASTag business, and people have been asked to replace their FASTags. So, that business has shrunk.  So, these are the 4 businesses and we are working on 3 of them. The next 3 to 6 months will tell us as to how the entire business pans out.  &amp;nbsp;  What’s your take on the Paytm issue at a larger level?  &amp;nbsp;  My view is that the Paytm was a pioneer when COVID hit us. A lot of merchants and customers have been with them. Technology wise, they are quite savvy. So, a lot of customers once they think that the things have settled down might come back. Maybe because they have had good experience and good memories of what Paytm has done, so, let us see how this pans out.  &amp;nbsp;  But the relationship is quite strong. If you recall, Paytm used to issue credit cards with HDFC Bank and Citibank. Then they shifted to SBI. They have also signed up with us to issue credit cards. We will do it at the right stage once things settle down. Right now, the focus is more to ensure that the business is well protected and then we will move to that stage.  &amp;nbsp;  Has the Paytm episode changed your philosophy towards fintech partnerships?  &amp;nbsp;  No, but we already had partnerships. So, we had Flipkart, we had GPay, we had Airtel Payments Bank, and we had started with Vistara. We have had a number of these relationships. We will go live soon with some of the other big players, and most of them have signed up with us. One of the reasons why we could partner with Paytm is because we could give them the scalability they wanted overnight.  &amp;nbsp;  How is the acquisition of Citibank’s retail business playing out?   &amp;nbsp;  On the tech migration side, we are working towards it. We are hoping to close it in the first half of this financial year. Already, there is a change in IFSC from Citi to Axis. So, today, Citi customers can also use the Axis access IFSC code to transfer money. So, that change has already happened. We are also trying to ensure that the credit card and the debit card numbers remain the same. We are trying to ensure the account numbers will remain the same. We are trying to ensure that whatever regular payments you have will be picked up from Citi automatically and will be part of your regular payment and Axis Bank account whenever the transition happens. So, a lot of work is being done in the background to ensure that customer inconvenience is reduced to a minimum.  The LCV portfolio and CVCC portfolio have already been migrated. So, that also has been done from Citi. We have taken a part of it and already migrated to the Axis systems. So, in the first half, all the branding will change. We will not replace all the cards on day one. We will not replace all the cards on day one; we will do it in a phased manner. Customers will stop seeing Citi statements and start seeing Axis statements from the LD2 date, as we are calling it.  We are very much on track with our timelines. We said 18 months, which happens in August, end of September. So, we will do it in the timeline we promised. So, I would say net-net, I think the overall acquisition, the absorption of the acquisition has gone quite well, and we are very happy about it.  You had earlier said that Citibank’s call centres were a great value addition.  So, there were 750-odd people who were Citibank employees who used to manage the call centre, and the call centre was known for the kind of services they provided and the kind of conversations you could have at the call centre. Firstly, almost all Citibank people have been trained in Axis Bank products and services. We are also expanding this list of 800 to almost 1,800 people. We are adding two more centres. We were bothered about the attrition rate in the initial stage, but it’s lower than what we see in the outsourced call centres. So, we are managing that well, too.  Is there any data update on fresh business acquisition post-Citi buy?  The number of products which they have sold to the existing Citi customers has gone up manifold. I mean, just to give you some data points, mortgage and fresh disbursals to model customers have gone up by year-on-year growth of 147%. So, there are a number of these data points across various products, and the penetration is much higher now because Citibank did not have those products. Citi’s corporate salaried franchise product was called Suvidha. Axis Bank has renamed its corporate salaried franchise as Suvidha. So, whatever made sense has already been done.  What is your market share in the corporate salaried market?  We don’t publish the data. It’s difficult to shift an existing customer unless the current bank does something that makes them really unhappy or if they’re willing to start a new relationship. So, these changes take time.  There is a view that bank relationship managers are hard-selling products to customers that they don’t really need…  Obviously, there is a huge backend engine which is running it. But it is a work in process. And yes, there is a reputation banks have that we only pitch and try to sell all the time, which does not work with a lot of the customers. We try very hard in our learning and development to train our RMs on how to sell, what to pitch, hear what the customers need and so on. We have a Siddhi App, which we keep talking about quite extensively, and in that Siddhi app, our RMs (relationship managers) are nudged on what they should be pitching. We are in the process of employing someone who will look at this as a science and art and help us with it since we have created a huge nudge library for ourselves. So, if you go to our mobile app, there will be specific and customised nudges only for you.  The RBI is visibly uncomfortable with the high credit-deposit (CD) ratio in the industry. Your views?  Yes, we understand and appreciate that and have a strategy to manage it. RBI has given various signals to the banking industry. One was that the credit growth was too high. It is not aligned with the deposit growth. Second, the unsecured loan portfolio was growing too rapidly. Third, your lending to NBFC also involves lending unsecured. Fourth is the CD ratio - it’s a different way of saying that the credit growth is higher than what it should be and that the deposit growth is not sustaining the credit growth.  What is your thinking within Axis Bank?  As far as our CD ratio is concerned, we have gone back to RBI with a strategy that has been accepted. Obviously, this means that we have to follow the strategy in terms of how this will play out this year and next. We have a plan, and we are sticking to it and watching this very closely.  See, all of us had realigned our balance sheet based on the NCR. So, for example, you may be doing a lot of refinance. So, even though your book is more balanced than before, because you have done a lot of refinance on a CD ratio basis, you might not be looking that good. So, now RBI wants us to monitor some other data point too. We have added it to the list of things which we monitor.  So, you have given your strategy to the regulator as far as the CD ratio is concerned.  As one of the elements which we do, yes. Based on that strategy, it is very clear that our asset growth has to be driven partly based on the deposit growth. And so, there is an allocation that will happen of that deposit growth to various asset classes, and people who are running those businesses have to follow that, and we monitor it very regularly. We have a pretty good idea as to where we will end up with it, and we are good with that.  RBI recently clarified the rules on alternative investment funds (AIFs)…  This conversation was going on with the lenders for quite some time, and obviously, something was driving it. So, they came out with a circular, but maybe there were some areas that needed clarifications, and now it has been done.  Does this mean that you can write back some provisions in Q4, given the clarifications on provisioning?  It will mean some write-back of provisions. We are still trying to get answers to all the queries we had. We follow a very conservative philosophy. So, if we do not have the answers, we will not write back that easily. However, it would mean some writing back because some of the answers are quite obvious.  Does the clarification give you the comfort of further AIF investments?  Obviously, this confirms that we can do lending of some kind. Venture capital funds use various instruments to invest. It is not just equity or debt all the time. It could be a combination also. The reason we had to make a provision was that we have invested in some venture capital funds which are funding the startup community, and we wanted to use that vehicle to ensure that we get to know what is happening in the startup community to some extent. So, we made provisions. Our idea was not to substitute lending of any kind. Our hope was that this would give us the ability to connect with those startups, and if it made sense, we would lend to them. It was not substituting our lending.  There is generally the impression that RBI is unhappy about banks’ lending to NBFCs…  So, couple of things there. One is that in some cases lending through fintechs or NBFCs is happening in a form and a shape where it appears that the banks have outsourced part of their core activity to these entities where models are being shared. So, RBI is very clear that you need to own it. That is why they have come out quite heavily on the digital lending guidelines. RBI wants a much stricter version of the understanding of the circular. All of us are implementing it.  The worry is that if you outsource your core activity and if things were to go wrong, you will not even be aware of it. So, you need to own it. I think it is a fair ask from the regulators.  &amp;nbsp;  This is a time when big banks are turning bigger. What is the vision for Axis Bank? Will you consider acquiring a mid-sized bank, such as Yes Bank?  We acquired Citi, and it has taken us 18 months. So, it is not an easy acquisition, right of any kind. Citibank, the reason I mentioned Citibank was, if you look at the number of employees, it is quite small, 3,400 employees. Not a very large balance sheet, Rs 50,000 crore. So, when you have to make an acquisition of this kind, you have to know upfront that it can take anywhere from 2-4 years of your time.  We believe, based on this experience, we would be quite circumspect of going and acquiring a bank just to grow in size, unless a sweetheart deal came along which made so much sense for us that we will do it. Right now, we have enough to do internally to increase the scale and size of our businesses. There is enough opportunity out there. I think if you look at all the investments that have been made in technology, cyber security, regulatory compliance and so on and so forth, I think the big banks will continue to become bigger at the cost of the smaller banks because the cost is not linear. I have been saying this for quite some time. My view is there is enough on our plate. We’ll continue to be focused on what we have to do.  The government may push ahead with PSB privatisation post-election. Would you be keen to bid?  No, too much to take on. They have a liability franchise in many cases and the CD ratio is in 70s for quite a few of them. But it is just a very different institution. They have built institutions based on their own policies, thought process, culture.  What is worrying you the most? Is that the culture? Legacy issues,..  Well, everything is different - culture, legacy issues, the way they think about business.  You recently got IRDAI approval for Max Life. So, what is the bank’s thinking regarding future stake increases?  So we are allowed at the group level up to 20%. At some stage we might go and get the other 1%. We are waiting for a final approval.  Subramanian Swamy made an allegation about the deal.  This is sub judice. We have followed all the rules and have all the approvals. Everything has been disclosed to all the regulators.  How are you tackling staff attrition issues at the bank?  We have done a number of things on this front. We have an internal programme called ‘Thrive’, through which we open up vacancies for our internal people for any position that is created within the Bank. We have been able to provide careers internally instead of employees seeking careers externally. They can start applying at the end of 16 months for a particular job. We also changed our promotion policy and included it in Thrive. If that job is at a higher grade, they can get a promotion at any time of the year if they get selected for the job. There are some criteria around it. But we have started doing that as an initiative. It has had, I would say, a significant impact on our mid and senior-level attrition because a lot of people have applied and benefited. Our attrition, hopefully when we print the numbers, you will see that it has had an impact on attrition also.  You had a serial dealmaker crossing over from JM Finance to Axis.. What is the strategy behind it?  Yes, that’s right. We want Axis Capital to remain one of the premier players in this space. We had some gaps which we have filled up. Our ability to attract talent continues to be showcased through some of these examples.  How are you seeing the economy in general?  Generally the economy is doing quite well, I mean, with the kind of spending which the government is doing and the kind of spending they are talking about, it is quite incredible. Private side has started talking about Capex. So my view is that, lot of right things are happening. If the Indian economy does not do well during this next 10-15 years, then when will it do well? We are quite uniquely placed and this our chance.  Is the private sector capex really picking up?  It still needs to go some distance, but in some specific areas, you are seeing it.  What’s your prediction for rate cuts?  I expect a status quo this time as I think the inflation battle is still not done to the level where the RBI wants it to be.  Are home loan rates likely to go up?  The market is too competitive. And if you want to grow your retail book, it’s the fastest way to grow a retail book, because the average transaction size is larger. So, some people go after mortgage business as a way to grow their business. But the real estate market is doing quite well. So, there are options there.  Anything you could tell us about the succession plans at the bank?  There is succession planning at all levels-- starting from the CEO down to all the key positions in the bank. So, that is very much a part of the exercise which we do all the time.  Are you looking forward to another term in the bank?  Let’s see. That -- I’ll comment only when we come to it.  What is your overall take on the overall asset quality?  All the mistakes in banking are made when the times are good. In bad times, all of us shut shop. We have put all these policies in place, but yes, one of the things all of us as CEOs need to be thinking about all the time is – are we making any mistakes? So, that we can consciously avoid them. Because times are too good, that is something we keep asking ourselves all the time.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-interview-next-3-6-months-will-tell-us-how-the-entire-business-with-paytm-pans-out-says-amitabh-chaudhry-12561051.html

The changes will be effective April 20, 2024.","Axis Bank credit cardholders were surprised with the notifications received in the evening of March 19 regarding revision in their card benefits. The benefits have been revised for nearly all of the bank's credit card portfolio, which includes entry-level cards such as the Flipkart Axis Bank credit card, and high-end cards such as Magnus, Magnus Burgundy, Burgundy Private, and the Reserve credit card.  The Bank has chopped off benefits on travel credit cards as well, which includes the Atlas credit card, and co-branded credit cards such as Vistara Infinite and Vistara Platinum. The changes will be effective April 20, 2024.  Reduced travel spends  Some of the critical changes are revisions in the EDGE reward points redemption and transfer programme, and the capping of accelerated rewards on travel spends on the Atlas credit card. EDGE rewards from Axis Bank is a loyalty program that allows customers to earn points across all retail products.  Also, some of the popular services, such as meet-and-greet, concierge, airport transfers, etc., are going away on credit cards. A minimum spend of Rs 50,000 is required in the preceding quarter to avail of domestic lounge access. Essential spend categories like utilities, insurance, and government payments are excluded from card reward points. On the Reserve card, the annual bonus of 50,000 EDGE reward points has been discontinued, and more.  “It's difficult to trust Axis Bank right now in terms of their credit card rewards and features, as the bank is announcing changes to their credit cards portfolio, or blocking the redemption of rewards frequently,” says Tejas Ghongadi, Co-Founder, of The Points Code. The Points Code is a platform that helps credit card users get maximum benefits from credit card rewards and redemptions.  Also read | Why are banks cutting down on free airport lounge visits?  “None of the announced changes affects the core value proposition for the customer,” says Sanjeev Moghe, President and Head, Cards and Payments, Axis Bank. He adds that the bank keeps reviewing its features and benefits vis a vis the competition  on an ongoing basis. The bank also sees which features and benefits are popular with cardholders, and which aren’t. The bank also recalibrates cards which are utilised by very few people, but  the costs of which are disproportionately high for the bank.  Below is an overview of some of the major changes to Axis Bank credit cards.  Revision to the EDGE reward points transfer programme  All existing EDGE rewards / MILES transfer partners shall now be divided into two groups (A and B) effective April 20.  The number of EDGE rewards / MILES that a customer can transfer will be capped based on the group to which the partner belongs. That is, a customer can transfer only a certain amount of their EDGE rewards / MILES to partners in group A, and similarly, to the rest to partners in group B.  “The transfer of EDGE rewards / MILES to the groups varies for the credit cards,” says Ankur Mittal, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, of Card Insider, a platform that tracks the credit card business. For instance, in the Reserve credit card, the overall capping per customer for EDGE rewards is 5 lakh points, and in group A and group B, the customer can transfer 1 lakh and 4 lakh EDGE reward points, respectively. Similarly, in the Magnus Burgundy credit card, the overall capping per customer for EDGE reward points is 10 lakh, while in group A and group B the customer can transfer 2 lakh and 8 lakh EDGE points, respectively (refer to the graphic).  “Group A and group B partners continue to offer good value to customers,” says Moghe. He adds, customers will be able to transfer the reward points at the same ratios as earlier.    Capping on accelerated EDGE miles on the Atlas credit card  Axis Bank has capped the accelerated EDGE Miles that can be earned on the Atlas credit card, which is popular in the travel segment. Cardholders will earn 5 EDGE Miles for every Rs 100 spent on Travel EDGE, airline, and hotel merchants, for transactions up to Rs 2 lakh per month. Thereafter, the cardholder will earn 2 EDGE Miles per Rs 100 spent on Travel EDGE, airline, and hotel merchants.  “We were seeing abnormal spending behaviour on some Atlas credit cards, so capping has been introduced,” says Moghe.  Further, the total EDGE MILES that can be converted to partner points in a calendar year is capped at 1.5 lakh EDGE MILES per customer. For the year 2024, customers can convert 1.5 lakh EDGE MILES from 20th April 2024 to 31st December 2024. From the next year onwards, the capping will apply from 1st January to 31st December 2025. The redemption through the Miles Transfer programme will be divided into two groups,  A and B (refer to the graphic).  Also read | Higher fees, lower reward points: Axis Bank cuts back on Magnus, Reserve credit card benefits  Discontinued reward points on renewal of Axis Reserve credit card   The Axis Reserve credit card has an annual / renewal fee of Rs 50,000, plus GST. The cardholder gets 50,000 reward points on card activation and renewal. Effective April 20, the annual benefit of 50,000 EDGE reward points will be discontinued.  On the Axis Reserve card,  annual fees are waived on spending Rs 35 lakh in the preceding year. “The card is for super affluent customers. We believe that the spend level is easily achievable for customers who take our Reserve card,” says Moghe. Since the customer will easily hit these spends, and their annual fee will be waived,  the bank has decided to do away with the 50,000 reward points on renewal.  Also read | Axis Bank reduces benefits on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card  Further, the spending threshold for the annual fee waiver will exclude spends on insurance, gold, and fuel. The current exclusions are government payments, wallet transfers, EMI payments, and utility bills. Further, the airport transfer service will also be discontinued for customers.  “Axis Bank just killed its topmost credit card,” says Sumanta Mandal, founder of TechnoFino, a platform that reviews debit and credit cards. He adds that on this card members are not earning reward points on essential categories like insurance, utility bills, and government payments. This card was known for its unique airport transfer benefit, but Axis Bank decided to remove that. “Instead of fixing loopholes, Axis Bank just removes benefits from the card,” Mandal adds.  However, Moghe says that the card has many features which continue to ensure that it remains a popular credit card.  Regarding the exclusion of spends on essential categories like utility bills,  etc., for computation of rewards on their high-end credit cards, Moghe says, “This is in line with industry norms; these are low interchange categories.&quot;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/rewards-restrictions-what-does-it-mean-for-axis-bank-cardholders-12501731.html

PPBL was acting as the backend bank powering Paytm's UPI payments until now  ,"A day after National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) gave One97 Communications Limited approval to be a third-party app on UPI platform, Yes Bank and Axis Bank went live on Paytm app early March 15, allowing users to create new handles.  The development comes on the day RBI's deadline for Paytm Payments Bank Limited to stop all banking operations runs out. PPBL was acting as the backend bank powering Paytm's UPI payments until now.  New users trying to register for UPI on Paytm app will get new handles backed by these banks instead of Paytm Payments Bank Limited, which has been almost rendered inactive by the Reserve Bank of India's crippling restrictions.  Yes Bank has gone live with a closed user group of users with @ptyes handle and Axis Bank has gone with @ptaxis handle.  Yes Bank has the additional role of migrating existing @paytm handles as of now. Paytm has around 90 million UPI users who are using @paytm handles. Other banks will also join Yes Bank in taking over these handles gradually.  The country's largest lender SBI and the largest private sector lender HDFC Bank will likely go live in a couple of days. SBI will go with @ptsbi and HDFC will go with @pthdfc handles.  These four banks will act as the payment service provider (PSP) banks, which connect a third party app to connect with the banking system.  While RBI has asked PPBL to stop all banking services, it made an exception to PSP services as the new banks will need a couple of months to migrate these users.  Paytm has around 11 percent market share in UPI and process more than three billion beneficiary transactions and around 1.6 billion outgoing transactions. Without a seamless migration from PPBL to other banks is required for the world's largest real-time payment system UPI to function seamlessly.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/yes-bank-axis-bank-go-live-on-paytms-upi-platform-12463621.html

Senior counsel for Axis Bank as well as Max Life told a bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Manmohan that the PIL by the former BJP MP was not maintainable as the issue squarely fell in the realm of a commercial transaction between private entities.  Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Axis Bank and its related companies, argued that the PIL does not state the &quot;class&quot; of individuals for whose benefit it has been filed when the aggrieved shareholders, if any, were capable of coming to court.  Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, who appeared for Max companies, asserted that the transaction, which was a purely commercial arrangement, has been looked into by the sector regulator.  Counsel for insurance sector regulator IRDAI said &quot;possible penalty&quot; has already been imposed by it in relation to the transaction in question.  Senior advocate Rajsekhar Rao, on behalf of the petitioner, stated that the issue &quot;warrants a larger look&quot;.  The bench, also comprising Justice Manmeet P S Arora, listed the matter for further hearing on April 3.  Swamy, a former BJP MP, in his PIL has sought a direction from the court for constituting a committee of experts to investigate the matter, asserting that the &quot;rot&quot; in private sector banks should be brought to light.  In his petition, Swamy has alleged Axis Bank made undue profits totalling Rs 4,000 crore from the sale and purchase of equity shares of Max Life in a non-transparent manner and in violation of the applicable regulations.  &quot;Axis Bank sold its stake of 0.998% shares of Max Life in March 2021 to MFSL (Max Financial Services Ltd) &amp;amp; Mitsui Sumitomo International at INR 166/- per share. Subsequently, in a very short span of time i.e., in March-April 2021 itself, Axis Bank Limited and its group entities acquired 12.002% shares from MFSL at price range of INR 31.51 - INR 32.12 per share,&quot; the petition said.  &quot;12.002 % of shareholding in Max Life is bought by the Axis Bank group companies at Rs. 31.51 / Rs. 32.12 per share at total consideration of 736 crores, which is evidently below the fair market value. On simple calculation, resulting in undue profits/gains from the purchase on the sale of equity shares of Max Life in non-transparent manner, Axis Bank has unlawfully gained approx. Rs 4000 crore,&quot; the petition claimed.

axis,2024-03-13T06:21:14+05:30,Hiral Thanawala,Using Axis Atlas credit cards for ‘business’ spends lands cardholders in a soup,"Axis' email to its credit card customers seeks invoices to verify that their trips were indeed intended for leisure. Usage for commercial or business purposes is not permitted, as it constitutes unfair accumulation of reward points.","Many cardholders of Axis Bank’s Atlas credit cards who swiped these cards to fund their travel will soon have to furnish invoices to prove that their trips were indeed meant for leisure, and not business.  The bank has also temporarily suspended all reward redemptions on the Axis Atlas credit card. As the news spread, some more Axis Bank customers raised similar concerns on social media platform X.  Several such cardholders received emails on March 11 from the private lender asking them to provide details of their travel transactions between November 1, 2023 and February 29, 2024.  “…a pattern of non-personal usage of your credit card(s) has been observed for the transactions undertaken by you with the following merchant(s): travel category,” the email, a copy of which Moneycontrol has accessed, said.  As per the bank’s policies, the credit cards can only be used for “…personal expenses and purposes, and any other transaction (including for business and commercial purposes) is prohibited under the Axis Bank’s card member agreement,” the email said.  The bank’s mail suggests that it noticed users spending money on expenses that are not personal in nature and hence, not usually allowed as it would amount to unfair reward accumulation.  “Axis Atlas is a travel focused credit card, so it's surprising that the bank is asking for invoices and clarification for travel category expenses over the past few months,” said Sumanta Mandal, founder of TechnoFino, a platform that reviews debit and credit cards.  “Evaluating usage of the features and benefits offered on various credit cards is a periodic and ongoing exercise. As part of this exercise, whenever the bank observes a pattern of transactions that is non-personal in nature, customers are requested to furnish evidence to establish the nature of such transactions,” an Axis Bank spokesperson told Moneycontrol.  Genuine credit card users affected  The exercise has resulted in users across the board, even those who swiped these cards specifically to fund personal travel expenses, landing in a soup.  “Axis Bank is trying to prevent misuse of credit cards by restricting reward points redemption, but some users who have genuine spends have also received the notices,” said Ankur Mittal, co-founder and chief technology officer, Card Insider, a platform that tracks credit card business.  Even such bona fide users will now have to go through the tedious process of producing bills to claim their rewards.  “Some people just spent under Rs 10,000 on travel categories have also received clarification notices,” Mandal said.  Also read | Credit card rewards: When the wrong Merchant Category Code can be costly for cardholders  Earlier blocking instances  Experts who track credit cards say that Axis Bank keeps a close vigil on suspicious spending patterns. In March 2023 it sent suspected commercial use notifications to the high networth individual (HNI) holders of cards such as Axis Magnus and Axis Reserve.  “The bank also has a history of cancelling cashback cards such as Axis Ace and Flipkart Axis Bank credit cards if they were found used for business purposes,” said Mandal.  Recourse for cardholders  Credit cardholders with genuine personal travel expenses and invoices to back these spends don’t have to worry. An email explaining the spends and soft copies of invoices would be sufficient.  The bank has sent a web link in the mail, allowing users to submit invoices, online. The proofs must be submitted within 30 days of getting the mail. You can also use phone banking to get in touch with the bank.  Also read | Credit Card Alert: Here are the charges you should be aware of   Keep personal and business expenses separate  Experts say it is not a good idea to mix business and personal expenses on your personal credit card. Personal credit cards are meant for personal use and the benefits and rewards are optimised based on individual usage.  “Most issuers have separate business credit cards that are specifically optimised for businesses and have better rewards and benefits for business users,” said Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar.com.  Proper use of a business credit card helps build business credit and also offers a chance to earn additional rewards and benefits.  Many banks draw a strict line between personal and business use of a personal credit card and outline them in their terms and conditions. Even credit card issuers who may not have explicitly mentioned it in their terms and conditions may flag excessive use for business purposes.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/using-axis-atlas-credit-cards-for-business-spends-lands-cardholders-in-a-soup-12447601.html

But, in between, the 22,500 level is likely to be crucial in determining the subsequent direction in the market","The market kept up the positive momentum for the fourth straight week ended March 7 and reached a new high with continuation of higher high formation amid decent volumes. Experts hope to see the Nifty 50 at 22,600 in an immediate term and 22,800 in the short term, with support at 22,400, and then at 22,200. But, in between, the 22,500 level is likely to be crucial in determining the subsequent direction in the market.  The Nifty 50 jumped half a percent last week to end at a new closing high of 22,493.50, whereas the broader markets underperformed with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices declining 0.4 percent and 2.85 percent.  On the daily charts, the Nifty 50 maintained an upward sloping resistance trendline adjoining the previous record highs, which is a positive sign.  &quot;From a technical perspective, there has been a bullish flag breakout observed on the daily scale of the Nifty index, indicating a potential target price of around 22,800. However, reaching the 22,500 level might introduce some softness in the market dynamics, as this represents the 100 percent extension of a previous move,&quot; Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi said.  Looking ahead, he feels 22,500 could act as an immediate resistance, with a close above this level possibly leading to further gains towards 22,800. On the downside, support is expected around the 22,200 to 22,000 range, with a major trend-changing support level identified at 21,500, he said.  From a technical standpoint, the index has managed to hold the higher ground and dips augured well for the bulls, but the range is narrowing down as the Nifty heads into an uncharted territory, which might be a sign of caution, said Osho Krishan, senior analyst in technical and derivative research at Angel One, who also sees similar support levels (of Jigar) for the benchmark index.  On the higher end, Osho feels finding resilience is challenging in an uncharted territory, though 22,600-22,650 could be seen as the following potent targets for the Nifty in the current week.

On March 6, the benchmark indices ended at a fresh record closing high on the back of strength in banking and financial services and technology stocks. The Nifty 50 rallied 118 points to 22,474, and formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, while the BSE Sensex climbed 409 points to 74,086.  However, the broader markets underperformed the benchmark indices as the Nifty Midcap 100 index fell half a percent and Smallcap 100 index 2 percent.  Stocks that outperformed broader markets and fared better than benchmark indices included Tata Chemicals, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, and Axis Bank. Tata Chemicals maintained the uptrend for the fifth consecutive session and surged 11 percent to Rs 1,178 on Wednesday after breaking out of a long downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of October 11, 2022 and January 5, 2024. The stock has formed a robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with significantly higher volumes.  ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company climbed 4.2 percent to Rs 577 and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with healthy volumes. The stock traded above all key moving averages with 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) moving above 200-day EMA, which is a positive sign.

The stock traded above all key moving averages and is very close to its downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of December 13, 2023 and January 8, 2024, which is crucial for further upward move towards record high of Rs 1,151.85.  Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares &amp;amp; Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Tata Chemicals  Over last few days, Tata Chemicals has experienced a remarkable rally, with its stock price surging approximately 270 rupees, leading to a notable return of 30 percent within this short period. This rapid ascent has undoubtedly enhanced the appeal of the stock, drawing attention from investors enticed by its recent upward trajectory.  However, despite the current attractiveness of the counter, it is imperative to exercise caution due to the significant resistance looming around Rs 1,200-1,205 range, primarily identified through the presence of a previous historical high depicted in the chart analysis.  Therefore, initiating fresh long positions at this juncture is not advisable. For individuals who have already entered the market, it is prudent to consider booking profits and adopting a wait-and-see approach, anticipating a meaningful correction in the stock's price before contemplating further investment actions.    ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company  After reaching its peak around Rs 616, ICICI Prudential underwent a substantial decline of approximately 153 rupees, marking a significant 25 percent decrease. Subsequently, it found support within the range of 50 percent to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels, as indicated on the chart.  Recently, the stock broke above a bearish trendline following a consolidation period lasting approximately two weeks, occurring near the 100 EMA (exponential moving average) on the weekly scale. This breakout suggests a favourable opportunity for investors, presenting an attractive entry point.  It is advisable to consider buying in two stages: first, within the range of Rs 570-580, and then near Rs 555-565 if the stock retraces. The upside target is set at Rs 620, with a stop-loss placed around Rs 540 based on daily closing prices.    Axis Bank  In recent weeks, Axis Bank has undergone an impressive rally, witnessing a substantial increase in its stock price by approximately 112 rupees, resulting in a notable return of 11 percent within a short span. This surge has undoubtedly caught the attention of investors attracted by the recent upward momentum.  However, despite the current allure of the stock, the caution is warranted due to significant resistance expected in Rs 1,130-1,150 range, primarily based on the presence of a previous historical high evident in chart analysis.  Therefore, initiating new long positions at this juncture is not advisable. For those already invested, it would be prudent to consider profit-taking and adopting a wait-and-see approach, anticipating a meaningful correction in the stock's price before considering further investment decisions.

Both parties have been in discussions with NPCI, the entity overseeing and regulating UPI, over the past few days. The application is likely to be formally submitted by both parties with a signed intent to collaborate. NPCI is expected to expedite the process to ensure that customers do not encounter any difficulties using the Paytm app for UPI payments.  Paytm, Axis Bank and NPCI did not respond to Moneycontrol queries on the partnership to be a TPAP player.  Paytm is also in discussions with several other banks, including Yes Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Canara Bank; however, none of the discussions have concluded yet.  Also read: No concessions to Paytm Payments Bank; Bank likely to become dormant if RBI doesn’t lift curbs on March 15  Since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed crippling restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL), an associate company of One97, the latter has been forced to seek bank partnerships to sustain its UPI business. The central bank has directed PPBL to halt all banking services, except for the withdrawal of the remaining funds in the accounts. It is believed that the payment service provider (PSP) services will also be affected.  Until now, PPBL has functioned as the PSP bank for One97. Paytm boasts an estimated 90 million UPI users on its platform. Major UPI apps like PhonePe, Google Pay, Cred, and Amazon Pay are TPAPs, having similar PSP bank partnerships to facilitate UPI transactions. However, Paytm did not require a bank partnership due to PPBL being a bank itself. In fact, for UPI payments, the Paytm app operated more like the mobile banking interface of PPBL.  Last week, Paytm signed a partnership with Axis Bank to transfer all nodal accounts maintained by PPBL to the private sector lender.  Axis Bank serves as a key payment service provider for major UPI players like Google Pay, Amazon Pay, Cred, and PhonePe. Once approved by the NPCI, Paytm will also function as a TPAP, similar to its competitors. Third-party apps are heavily dependent on PSP banks when it comes to the speed of the payments or even ensuring that payment failures are kept to a minimum. Players like PhonePe and Google Pay typically have at least three bank partnerships to minimise risk.  PPBL has been the largest beneficiary bank in the UPI ecosystem of over the last three years with over 20 percent market share in inbound credit transactions. Despite its scale, it was consistently among the banks with the lowest transaction failures.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/paytm-axis-bank-to-submit-tpap-application-for-upi-business-with-npci-this-week-12303861.html

Axis Bank has obtained all necessary regulatory approvals in connection with these transactions, the bank informed stock exchanges. “We will also take required steps to defend Axis Bank against any unfounded allegations,” the bank said in the statement.  Further, Axis Bank said it believes there is no material impact of the allegations being made against it in connection with the transactions.  “Axis Bank adheres to highest standards of legal and regulatory compliance, and we are committed to take actions in compliance with applicable laws,” it added.  Earlier, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy moved the Delhi High Court, alleging the private bank's involvement in an Rs 5,100-crore scam regarding the Max Life transaction.  Axis Bank shares fell more than 2 percent in afternoon trade on February 15 after Swamy moved the Delhi High Court, alleging the private bank's involvement in an Rs 5,100-crore scam, a report said. It finally closed at Rs 1,074.75, down 2 percent on the NSE.  In an post on X platform, Bar and Bench website said Swamy alleged that Axis Bank made undue gains by way of transactions in shares of Max Life Insurance, and moved court seeking investigation by a committee of experts into the transaction.  &quot;There was a blatant fraud in Max Life Insurance and Max Financial Services allowing their shareholder Axis Bank and its group companies Axis Securities and Axis Capital to make undue profits or gains from the purchase and sale of equity shares of Max Life in non-transparent manner thereby, violating the mandatory directions of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India,&quot; he has said.  Moneycontrol couldn't verify the report independently.  In a statement, Max life insurance said, &quot;We would like to further state that with respect to transactions involving shares of Max Life between MFSL and Axis Bank, SEBI has sought various details/ clarifications from MFSL and Max Life and the requisite details have been submitted by MFSL to SEBI for its consideration, from time to time as advised by SEBI.&quot;  &quot;We believe that there is no legal or regulatory anomaly in the transactions and due process of law has been followed.  The Company and MFSL shall take all requisite legal recourse to defend the matter before the Hon’ble Court, &quot;it added.  Swamy contented that Axis Bank group companies bought 12.02 percent shareholding in Max Life Insurance for Rs 31.51- Rs 32.12 a share at total consideration of Rs 736 crore, which is below the fair market value.  He further said that though the IRDAI imposed a penalty of Rs 3 crore on Max Life Insurance for misrepresentation but it was negligible compared to the size of the &quot;fraud&quot;.  A bench of acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora heard the matter briefly and adjourned the case to March after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Axis Bank, said he had not been served a copy of the petition.

In our view, this is a reason for investors to pay more attention to a cheaper part of the Indian market, namely state-owned enterprises,&quot; said Wood in his latest 'GREED &amp;amp; Fear' note.  The Nifty PSE index has rallied 110 percent in the last one year. State Bank of India has gained 31 percent in the last one year, while Life Corporation of India has gained 74 percent. Hindustan Aeronautics has surged 147 percent in the same period.  Earlier this week, PM Modi  lauded the increased public confidence in public sector units (PSUs) under the BJP-led NDA government. In an address to the Rajya Sabha, Modi noted that the net worth of India's PSU companies has surged by 78 percent since 2014, and their shares are now yielding favourable returns.  Before that, last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also highlighted that the government was all in to improve the valuation of PSUs, in an exclusive interview with Network18. Government-owned companies have historically traded at discounts to their private peers. However, in the last couple of years, they have closed the gap.  Portfolio changes  Wood has announced adjustments to the India long-only portfolio, ahead of upcoming general elections. In the India long-only portfolio, a new investment in Bharti Airtel will be introduced, accounting for 3 percent weight.  This addition will come by reducing the investment in Reliance Industries by three percentage points. The allocation to HDFC Bank will be reduced by two percentage points.  Investments in Axis Bank and State Bank of India will each be increased by a percentage point.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  As for the global long-only portfolio, Wood reduced investment in HDFC Bank by two percentage points, while that in Axis Bank and TSMC were increased by a percentage point each.    Wood wrote in his note that the interim budget was a pleasant surprise to GREED &amp;amp; Fear, his much followed column. &quot;It is testament to the confidence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the pending general election in April-May that his government announced a budget on 1 February that is almost devoid of vote-buying populism,&quot; he wrote.  With government capex set to increase 17 percent year-on-year to Rs 11.11 lakh crore in FY25, Wood reiterates L&amp;amp;T GREED &amp;amp; Fear's 6 percent weighting in that stock in the India long-only portfolio and a 5 percent position in the Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio.  &quot;It has been an ongoing feature of Modi’s government that the fiscal deficits have been used mainly to finance infrastructure investments rather than transfer payments,&quot; he said.

While this is sentimentally positive for the six stocks in the near term, it does not mean that HDFC's stake will necessarily go up to 9.5 percent in these lenders .  We spoke to analysts and looked into past trends of such RBI approvals. Here is what we found:  What is the RBI approval all about?  The HDFC group as a whole, including HDFC Life, HDFC AMC and HDFC Ergo, can now acquire up to 9.5 percent stake each in six banks - IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank and Bandhan Bank.  A business group cannot hold more than 10 percent stake in a bank. Therefore, approvals are sought for 9.99 percent, the maximum limit.  Despite the perceived intent, it does not mean that full 9.99 percent stake will be acquired. Since it does not make sense to seek RBI approval for every 1-2 percent stake, companies tend to ask for the maximum 9.99 percent.  How much does the HDFC group currently hold in these banks?  At the end of the December quarter, it held 3.43 percent in ICICI Bank, 2.57 percent in Axis Bank, 4.48 percent in IndusInd Bank and 3 percent in Yes Bank.  Why is RBI approval needed?  The RBI's approval is a must for anyone looking to acquire more than 5 percent stake in a bank as it is a highly regulated sector, said Vijay Singh Gour, lead analyst, Choice Broking.  Also Read: China's market restrictions won't help, may be bad for EMs, no immediate impact on India  What is the validity of the approval?  The approval is valid for a year and if HDFC fails to acquire the shareholding within that period, the approval stands cancelled.  If the holding stands at sub-5 percent before the year-end, then RBI’s approval will be required again to increase it to 5 percent or more.  Is this sign of merger?  No. It is simply an approval for investment purpose, clarified Jignesh Shial of Incred Equities.  Other examples...  LIC on January 24 received the RBI's approval to acquire up to 9.99 percent in HDFC Bank. In December 2023, ICICI Prudential AMC got RBI nod to acquire 9.99 percent in Federal Bank.  In October 2023, HDFC AMC got the RBI’s go-ahead to acquire 9.5 percent in DCB Bank, Equitas Small Finance Bank, The Federal Bank, Karur Vysya Bank and City Union Bank.  Also Read: Credit growth to moderate to 13%; Paytm and lower-rated NBFCs at risk: Macquarie’s Suresh Ganapathy  Any instances where RBI approval has lapsed before a 9.9 percent stake acquisition?  Yes. In November 2021, LIC got approval to hike stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank to up to 9.9 percent. A year later, its stake in the lender had gone up to 6.25 percent from 4.96 percent.  In May 2023, SBI MF received similar approval for HDFC Bank. Three months to go for the validity to lapse and SBI MF holds about 5.57 percent stake in the bank.  What does it mean for the six stocks?  It is a sentimentally positive news, said Nitin Aggarwal, head–BFSI research, institutional equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “Flows should come in over the medium term,&quot; he said.  What do back-to-back RBI approvals indicate?  Domestic institutions, including LIC, are eyeing to increase stake in private banks. Since October 2023, domestic institutions have created over Rs 1.4 lakh crore headroom to buy stakes.  With the general election unlikely to throw a surprise and expectations of private capex picking up, domestic institutions are waiting on the sidelines to hike stakes in banks and financials.  Banking stocks are seen as a reasonably valued bets at a time when the market sits on high valuations, analysts said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/mc-explains-will-hdfc-group-go-ahead-and-acquire-9-5-stake-in-all-the-6-banks-12203291.html

NIMs moderated 10bp QoQ to 4.01%. The management has suggested that funding costs will continue to inch up over the next two quarters.

Asset-quality trends improved despite higher slippages (1.9% vs 1.8% q-o-q), mainly due to higher recoveries &amp;amp; upgrades. Net slippages were lower at Rs. 1,117 crore vs. Rs. 1,269 crore q-o-q. NIM fell 10 bps q-o-q to 4.01% (on expected lines). Deposit growth (+5% q-o-q) outpaced loan growth (+4% q-o-q) mainly driven by bulk term deposits (+21% q-o-q).

Brokerages issued ‘buy’ calls on the stock on hopes of better loan growth, and the stock's attractive valuations.  Axis Bank Q3FY24 net profit grew a modest 4 percent on-year to Rs 6,071 crore due to AIF-related provisioning, while the net interest income (NII) grew 9 percent on-year to Rs 12,532 crore, led by a healthy credit growth.  In the past one year, the Axis Bank stock has surged over 16 percent, outperforming the Bank Nifty index, which gained just 5 percent. Earlier, Axis Bank shares hit a 52-week high of Rs 1,151 each on December 5, 2023.  Analysts see credit profile improving  Analysts at Jefferies shared a 'buy' call on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,380 per share as against the last close of Rs 1,088. While Q3 profit was a little below their estimates due to weaker NII or net interest margins (NIMs), analysts still believe that the franchise is strong enough to deliver 16-18 percent growth in loans going ahead.  &quot;We could also see improvement in deposit profile that would sustain the return on equity (RoE) of 18 percent. We see a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17 percent over FY24-26. At valuations of 1.8x FY25 adjusted PB/10x PE are attractive and 20 percent discount to ICICI Bank,&quot; the brokerage firm added.  HSBC analysts, too, remained bullish on the lender, sharing a target price of Rs 1,404 per share but cut FY24-26 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 0.3-1.5 percent. &quot;The EPS cut reflects minor adjustments to growth, NIM, and operating expenditure estimates. We expect FY24-26 EPS CAGR of 14 percent for Axis Bank,&quot; they wrote in a post-results review.  Also read: As Bank Nifty closes at 45,000; support shifts down to 44,000; 'Sell on Rise', say experts  Margin pressure to continue till Q1FY25  Higher cost of funds, however, contracted NIMs to 4.01 percent in Q3FY24 from 4.26 percent in Q3FY23. The cost of funds jumped to 5.35 percent Q3FY24 as compared to 4.34 percent a year ago, as per the exchange filing.  Analysts at Motilal, thereby, cut their FY25 EPS by 8 percent, considering an increase in costs and margin pressures. The brokerage firm downgraded its rating on Axis Bank to 'neutral' with a target price of Rs 1,175 per share.  Moreover, the management commentary suggested that margin pressure is likely to continue till Q1FY25 due to deposit repricing but the pace of increase will temper down.  Elevated CD ratio may limit credit growth  The lender's loans grew 23 percent on-year in Q3FY24, led by the retail segment. Deposits, on the other hand, climbed by 18 percent on-year during the quarter.  As a result, its credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio turned to be elevated at 93 percent as against RBI's comfortable range of 70-80 percent. This, analysts believe will limit credit growth going ahead.  &quot;We will keep an eye on the near-term growth as an elevated CD ratio will constrain credit growth, while continued re-pricing of deposits will likely exert pressure on margins in the coming quarters. The bank has a healthy LCR of 118 percent as it maintains industry best outflow rates. However, the impact of a surge in non-retail deposits will need to be watched over the coming quarters,&quot; said analysts at Motilal Oswal.

RWA norms impact  The lender, in its investor presentation said that it had an impact of 370 basis points (bps) due to the risk weight diktat by the central bank. “We had a 370 bps impact of regulatory change in risk weights,” the bank said.  The central bank on November 16 said that it has increased risk weight by 25 percent on consumer credit exposure of commercial banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Consumer credit of commercial banks and NBFCs attracts a risk weight of 100 percent, which now has been revised to 125 percent.

","Tax exemption on capital gains bonds is at a limit of Rs 50 lakh, and there has been a long-standing demand to extend that to Rs 1 crore. Suresh Ganapathy, Managing Director, Macquarie Capital, believes there is a possibility it will be addressed in the upcoming interim budget because real estate prices have gone up.  Ganapathy has been tracking the financial services sector for over two decades now. At the current juncture, he believes private sector banks are better placed than public sector banks. “Private sector banks are better in terms of digital banking, branch expansion, etc. Moreover, HDFC Bank is making life difficult for everybody in the system owing to merger-related needs,” he said.  Also Read: HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie  Edited excerpts:  What are your expectations for the banking sector from the interim budget? Or do you think it's going to be a non-event? I don’t expect too many announcements in this budget. There could possibly be further housing incentives or extensions of housing benefits from a taxation standpoint for the consumer. So at best, that is something I expect. Anyway, over the past few years, there has not been any capital allocation towards public sector banks because the health of the public sector banks has been pretty good. I think that trend will continue.  What are your expectations regarding housing incentives? Nothing major. However, the tax exemption on capital gains bonds is at a limit of Rs 50 lakh, and there has been a long-standing demand to extend that to Rs 1 crore. There is a possibility that it gets extended because real estate prices have gone up. Currently, the interest exemption on housing loans is Rs 2 lakh. That might also be partially increased. So, basic tinkering like that.  Also Read: 68% HNIs, 43% retail investors flip IPO trades in first week, says Sebi chair Madhabi Buch  A few weeks ago, a government document on the merger of four public sector banks was doing the rounds. Do you anticipate any announcements on that front? In the past, the government, may not directly but indirectly, has indicated that they would like to reduce the number of public sector banks and make them larger. Some of these PSU banks are still small, and therefore, merger is an inevitable option. It may not happen necessarily through a budget speech, but that's the medium-term goal of the government.  But why is that? If all the public sector banks have healthy asset quality now and no further capitalisation is needed from the government side… Where are the people to run these organisations? The existing management is getting old. There’s a musical chair taking place within the PSU banks. A’s ED (executive director) is moving to B. B’s ED is switching to A. That's a big challenge over a long time.  And from the RBI’s perspective, it is easier to manage a few large ones than multiple small ones.  Also Read: Sebi probing mule accounts, faulty IPO applications, 3 cases under scanner, says Buch  So, what's your pecking order now? Private sector banks over PSU banks, what do you prefer? We clearly prefer private sector banks over public sector banks. Look at the books over the past five years. PSU banks have lost market share and deposits — both CASA as well as term deposits. Anyway, they were losing market share on loans, and I think that will continue. The private sector banks are better in terms of digital banking, branch expansion, etc. Moreover, HDFC Bank is making life difficult for everybody in the system owing to merger-related needs. So, private sector banks will continue to grow faster than public sector banks.  Over the next six to 12 months, ECL (expected credit loss) guidelines will also come through, and private sector banks have better wherewithal to manage that compared to public sector banks.  And when the ECL guidelines kick in, will there be a sudden bump up in provisions for all banks? The RBI has given a five-year amortisation period for all the banks in the system once these ECL provisions are quantified. To that extent, there is time for banks to digest the impact. Private sector banks have contingent provisions that they can use to tide over this change and, thus, are in a better position. However, stock markets react differently. The moment it comes through, there could be a sharp reaction.  Also Read: Cycle of local players entering market almost over, says HUL's Rohit Jawa  Is there any investment case for old banks, like Karnataka Bank or Federal Bank? The thing about these old banks is that they are regionalised and localised. They are not pan-India. As long as they remain small and focus on their local markets, they have a basic level of strong customer franchise, and they keep getting those liabilities — all is good. They might not grow at 25-30 percent, but they can still grow around 14-15 percent and maintain profitability for the foreseeable future. They will never be in a position to topple the big private-sector banks.  But they should stay in the main domain areas where they have a better presence. For instance, City Union Bank in Tamil Nadu and Federal Bank in Kerala have a good catchment in terms of NRI customers. The niche is unlikely to be disrupted in a big way, and they can deliver moderate performance over the next four to five years.  Among private sector banks, what is your pecking order? We believe the best earnings growth will occur next year amongst the frontline top private sector banks. We expect around 15-20 percent earnings growth. So, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, and Axis Bank will be my top picks in the space.

The lender's appeal was for passing appropriate orders directing Sebi, NSDL and NSE to comply with the SAT's ruling last month and remove all the lock-in and all other obstacles with respect to the invocation of the pledged shares.  In its order passed on December 20, SAT quashed Sebi's two orders passed in January 2020 and December 2019 that barred lenders from invoking the pledge on shares in the Karvy Stock Broking matter. Sebi, NSDL and NSE were also directed to release the shares in four weeks.  The tribunal's ruling had come on appeals filed by Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Finance against the two Sebi orders.  Dismissing Axis Bank's plea on Friday, SAT clarified that &quot;four weeks from the date of the order were available both to Appellant Axis Bank and to Sebi, NSE and NSDL to implement the directions given by this tribunal in its order dated December 20, 2023&quot;.  According to the tribunal, the unilateral action on the part of Sebi, NSE and NSDL in transferring the shares to investors was &quot;illegal and without jurisdiction&quot;.  &quot;... the tribunal went on to give separate directions for the appellant Axis Bank and for other appellants. The separate directions were required due to the status of pledged shares as for the shares pledged to Axis Bank this tribunal had directed parties to maintain status quo vide its order dated December 17, 2019,&quot; SAT said on Friday.  For other appellants, the tribunal said the pledged shares had been transferred to the clients of the broker by the respondents.  Against this backdrop, the SAT on Friday said its December order &quot;needs to be read in totality&quot;.  In the December order, the tribunal, as an alternative option, had directed the respondents &quot;to compensate the appellants (lenders) with the value of the underlined securities pledged in their favour along with interest 10 per cent per annum within the same period&quot;.  Sebi and NSDL have already filed an appeal before the Supreme Court, challenging the order of the SAT.  Axis Bank's counsel argued that leeway of four weeks was given only in the case of appellants other than Axis Bank. For Axis Bank, the order of the Tribunal became effective immediately and therefore, there is no restriction whatsoever on the bank from invoking the pledge of shares created in its favour and selling the shares to the extent of its full and complete dues.  Counsels of NSDL and Sebi stated that they did not press for stay at the time of pronouncement of orders on December 20, 2023, as they believed that the tribunal had granted four weeks time for compliance of directions in the said order.  The total dues payable to Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Finance was over Rs 1,400 crore, according to Sebi's order passed in December 2019.  An outstanding amount of Rs 80.64 crore, along with interest, was due to Axis Bank from Karvy, Rs 642.25 crore to ICICI Bank, Rs 344.5 crore to Bajaj Finance, Rs 208.5 crore due to HDFC Bank, and Rs 159 crore to IndusInd Bank, the order had said.  The case pertains to the securities held by Karvy, which were allegedly used by the brokerage for borrowing courtesy of the power of attorneys that they had. The securities held by over 83,000 clients were given back to them after Sebi's direction.

","ICICI Bank Ltd. ended Axis Bank Ltd.’s 16-year reign as the largest arranger of rupee-denominated corporate bonds as sales climbed to a record last year.  India’s second-largest lender by market value managed 980.3 billion rupees ($11.8 billion) of offerings in 2023, including self-led transactions. That’s 17% of the total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HDFC Bank Ltd. stood second, with deals worth 797.4 billion rupees.  Axis Bank, which dominated the local-currency bond market from 2007 to 2022, came in third after arranging 763.5 billion rupees of transactions.  The lender “focused on higher fees business instead of just chasing volumes,” Neeraj Gambhir, group executive and head of treasury, markets and wholesale banking products at Axis, said in an interview.    Axis will stick to the same strategy this year and look to arrange more deals for AA to A rated issuers as well as private credit firms, Gambhir said. The lender will also focus on issuance from real estate investment trusts and InvITs as it expects them to become big borrowers in the bond market, he added.  ICICI Bank didn’t reply to an email seeking comments.  Businesses in the world’s fastest-growing major economy raised a record 10.4 trillion rupees selling bonds in 2023, and Gambhir expects issuance to increase by 15% this year as companies will likely take advantage of borrowing costs coming down if global central banks cut interest rates as expected.  Gambhir expects the new investment guidelines for banks that take effect in a few months to provide further impetus to the corporate bond market. India’s central bank in September allowed lenders to include company notes in their held-to-maturity book, and not be required to mark-to-market against yield movements.  “Apart from refinancing needs, we expect capital expenditure cycle to gain strength in the second half of the calendar year prompting firms to tap the bond market,” Gambhir said. Spreads between corporate and sovereign debt will remain tight as the supply of company notes is unlikely to exceed demand, he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/icici-bank-ends-axis-16-year-run-as-rupee-bond-market-king-12028601.html

In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol, Duggad discussed how the Nifty earnings per share (EPS), if maintained around Rs 1,140 for FY25, would result in a potential target of 22,800 six months ahead, based on the market trading at its long-term average. However, he emphasised that this target is subject to adjustments influenced by political outcomes, market flows, sentiment, and liquidity.  Duggad highlighted the macroeconomic picture, citing India's growth leading at 7.7 percent in the first half and expected to reach 6.5-6.8 percent for FY24. He noted stability in global interest rates reaching their peak and a similar expectation domestically. Crude prices and bond yields, both nationally and internationally, have stabilised.  Additionally, he pointed out impressive earnings growth, with the recent Nifty earnings season showing 28 percent growth against an expected 21 percent. Corporate earnings have surged by 30 percent in the first half, with a revised full-year estimate at a 22 percent growth rate, resulting in attractive valuations for large caps at approximately 18 times.  Furthermore, he said that since September various high-frequency indicators have consistently shown positive trends, such as GST collection, monthly auto sales, power and freight demands, and PMI data for manufacturing and services. The economy maintains momentum supported by robust corporate earnings, and domestic market flows have sustained stability. He concluded that the recent relief from political uncertainty could potentially fuel a pre-election rally in the foreseeable future. Edited excerpts:  Your report suggests that Nifty has given positive returns (9 percent-36 percent) six months into the announcement of general election results (November to May) on five previous such occasions (1999-2019). What can we expect during the 2024 elections?  Yes, we've noted pre-election stock market trends. Over 25 years, pre-election periods from November to May show double-digit returns, with the lowest at 9 percent and the highest hitting 30-35 percent twice. The context varied each time, including recoveries like the 2009 market rebound from the global financial crisis. The recent election results have relieved market uncertainty, particularly concerning state poll outcomes. This performance boost for the current administration in three out of four states strengthens confidence in political stability post-2024 elections. India seems to have multiple favourable factors aligning both at macro and micro levels. It won't be farfetched to say that a lot of stars are aligning for India, whether at the macro level or micro level.  On a macro scale, our economy leads in growth, hitting around 7.7 percent in the first half and likely to reach 6.5-6.8 percent for FY24. Global interest rates seem to have reached their peak, and domestically, it's likely the same. Crude prices are stable within a certain range, and bond yields, both nationally and internationally, have stabilised.  Additionally, on a micro level, there's been remarkable earnings growth. The recent earnings season for Nifty showcased a 28 percent growth compared to the expected 21 percent. Corporate earnings have soared by 30 percent in the first half, and our revised full-year estimate stands at a 22 percent growth rate. This collective positive performance translates to highly attractive valuations for large caps, hovering around 18 times.  Since September, multiple high-frequency indicators — like GST collection, monthly auto sales, power and freight demands, alongside PMI data for manufacturing and services — have demonstrated consistent positive trends. The economy has maintained a decent momentum, with strong corporate earnings. Market flows, especially domestic ones, have remained steady. The recent alleviation of political uncertainty adds to market optimism. This positive shift could potentially extend into a pre-election rally in the foreseeable future.  What kind of uptick in percentage terms can one look at in the run-up to the general elections? What are the risk factors you think can spoil this rally?  Yeah. So I would not hazard a guess on the percentage of upside, because that's always fraught with a lot of risk. So I won't go down that path. All I can say is that people who haven't yet entered the markets and want to enter now, have to enter with a long-term horizon.  You cannot enter for a one-month, three-month kind of play. If you have a three-year, five-year horizon, and you have capital which you can dispense for that period, then obviously, this period looks good enough, because if we compound at 14-15 percent earnings for the next three years, right now we're talking about 18 percent for next two-year CAGR, even if you were to stretch that to say 15 percent for three years, given the fact that we are trading at 18 times, which is a 10 percent discount to long period average 20 times, the possibility of an investor entering now and earning around 14-15 percent in line with the corporate earnings growth is very strong.  What happens is if you look at the last 12-13 years history of India, a lot of events have come and gone. Macro, micro, global, US Fed, crude oil prices, trade wars and a lot of other wars. One thing that the market has always respected is the underlying corporate earnings. 2010 to 2020 when corporate earnings grew at 6.5 percent compounding, Nifty gave you 8.5 percent compounding, right? From 2020 to 2023, corporate earnings compounded at 23 percent. Nifty gave you 27 percent compounding. And this year, we are talking about FY24 so far, 20 percent growth. So let us see where it ends. But it is safe to say that markets will broadly respect corporate earnings in the long term. In the short to medium term, a lot of events will drive it. Sentiments, flows, and liquidity will drive the market in the short to medium term, but eventually, the market will converge on corporate earnings. That's what history teaches us.  As for the risk, the biggest risk is always in the unknown, right? Because if something is known as a risk, the market tends to discount it very fast, we've seen the corrections in the last 10 years. Last durable corrections, there are very few in the last 10 years, but whenever they have happened, they have happened led by factors which were unknown and unpredictable.  You look at 2018, IL&amp;amp;FS came out of the blue. You didn’t know. Covid 2020, a once-in-a-century kind of an event, obviously couldn’t be forecast. In 2013 there was a decent correction, which happened because of the taper tantrum. So the biggest risk is in the unknown factors. So that you can navigate by getting into fundamentally strong stocks with good balance sheets and cash flows. And you do not overpay too much for that growth.  Can we still look to rally in the range of 9-36 percent in November-May witnessed in the previous elections?  Looking at data is like looking at history; it might repeat or not. As equity analysts, our job is to construct a fundamental understanding. Politics will play out as it does, and from what I gather about politics, some uncertainty has diminished. However, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves because circumstances often change unexpectedly. But assuming this current scenario continues, we can forecast two things.  Focusing on the numbers, the Nifty EPS remains around Rs 1,140 for FY25, with minor fluctuations. If the market trades at its long-term average, which spans a decade and stands at 20 times, considering the current 21 times for FY24, with an EPS of Rs 1,000, projecting at 20 times for FY25, we reach a mathematical target of 22,800 six months down the line. This target can be adjusted based on various factors like political outcomes, market flows, sentiment, and liquidity at that juncture.  If we purely focus on fundamental analysis then 22,800 stands as the mathematical target based on our current EPS estimate without any alterations. However, I've consistently used the conditional ‘if’ because that's the nature of the market — nothing is entirely certain, and we must work with probabilities. Remaining flexible is crucial; we need to adapt our estimations as things progress. Earnings can both disappoint and surprise; for instance, the first-half earnings surprised, leading to a 2 percent upgrade. What if the second-half earnings disappoint? There are numerous factors, both positive and negative, that play into these calculations. Being aware of these uncertainties is essential in this landscape.  Let's talk about your midcap ideas, Godrej Properties, Indian Hotels, Angel One, Global Health, Lemon Tree and PNB Housing. Of all, one idea where you are most bullish and why?  Within the large-cap space, I would prefer Titan because that's something which is a proven performer and it's a stock where we've been bullish for more than 10 years now. We see the compounding story unfolding very well. And that's our top/number one preferred consumer discretionary idea in India for more than a decade and we continue with it.  So far as mid-caps are concerned, I think pointing out one idea will be very difficult because mid-caps are always bottom up and it makes sense to have a basket of a couple of ideas, which is why we have spoken about, say, hotels, real estate, and industrials. We put out a very big, large thematic report on capital goods/industrials yesterday, covering 11 new stocks. So Indian Hotel, Lemon Tree, Metro — some of those ideas apart from Godrej and Sobha from the discretionary basket, and from the financial market, I would put my finger on Angel One. Others are mentioned there in our report. Some of them are part of our model portfolio as well. So we are just reiterating them.  What is the rationale and the fundamentals behind picking Angel One at this juncture? The stock has witnessed 8 times jump in 25 months.  We included Angel at around Rs 1,800 two months ago when our preview report was released. Fortunately, the stock has performed remarkably well, surging approximately 50-55 percent from that point. What's most noteworthy is the earnings have pleasantly surprised for the fourth consecutive quarter, leading to upgrades.  The fundamental narrative behind the stock remains exceptionally strong. There's an evident trend of financial savings getting more technologically inclined. Their monthly disclosures on market share, volumes, and new customer additions consistently reinforce our confidence in this narrative. Despite the rally, the stock is still priced at 20-22 times with a high Return on Equity (ROE) and significant dividend payout.  However, it's crucial to acknowledge its high beta nature, typical for a capital market-oriented company. There's a potential downside, especially if the markets correct or sentiments worsen. This stock has already displayed substantial growth over the past three years. We previously had it in our model portfolio when it ranged from almost Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,700. It was reintroduced in October during our 2Q FY24 preview analysis.  Your midcap ideas seem to be divided between hotel and real estate. Help us understand what you see in the real estate sector  Real estate has endured a downward trend for over a decade since 2010. Only recently have we observed improvements, with companies performing well, better execution, and enhanced pre-sales. Following a remarkable FY23, we initially anticipated growth moderation at the outset of FY24, projecting a 14 percent pre-sales increase for our coverage universe.  However, as of December, that estimate has already surged to 31 percent. We recently released a sector note on real estate, detailing the changes in numbers and our perspective on pre-sales and new launches. In the first half, there were approximately Rs 26,000 crore of new launches, and we anticipate the second half to witness Rs 80,000 crore or more for our coverage universe. Crucially, balance sheets have shown improvement as real estate operates based on both balance sheet strength and cash flow.  Additionally, the affordability of properties for end buyers has increased over the last seven to eight years due to decent income growth, while property prices in metros struggled for a significant part of the last decade. We foresee further momentum ahead; we're merely in the second year of an upturn. Hence, our bullish stance on real estate persists, with a couple of highlighted ideas featured in our report.  Since the rally is led by financials, do you think the space looks attractive at the current valuations?  As far as banks are concerned, you have to admire the fact that they've had one of the best last five years in terms of their operational performance. As I keep repeating, the profit pool of financials in Nifty has increased five times in five years, from Rs 45,000 crore in 2018 to Rs 2,20,000 crore in 2023. I mean, talking about that profit pool jumping to Rs 3 lakh crore in FY25. But the market cap hasn't kept pace with that.  You know, if you look at the market cap of the same 11 companies in Nifty, back in FY18, the combined market cap was Rs 21 lakh crore. As we speak, it has not even crossed Rs 40 lakh crore. So, what has happened is some of the big banks have seen de-rating, which essentially means that the risk-reward for large-cap banks has become extremely attractive in our view, whether it is private or PSU. We like both.  But relatively, our preference has been more towards PSU banks for more than a year. We have a huge overweight sitting in our model portfolio on PSU banks. And, of course, we have the usual names in private banks in our portfolio – ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and AU Finance. So, we are very positive overall. It's one of our preferred sectors, given the valuation and attractive risk-reward that exist in the financial space.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stars-aligning-at-macro-and-micro-levels-for-india-motilal-oswal-financial-services-gautam-duggad-11863271.html

HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are his top picks","Bulls pushed Nifty Bank index to fresh record highs on December 4 amid a rally fuelled by BJP's state election wins. The banking index surged over 1,600 points or 3 percent to hit a fresh high of 46,484, clocking its biggest single-day gain since April 2022. It settled at 46,431. The sharp rally has pushed Bank Nifty's year-to-date gains to 7 percent, trimming its underperformance vis-a-vis NSE Nifty50.  Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies LLP believes that the banking sector is set for recovery.  Bank Nifty index fell to 42,280 on October 26. Since then, the index has bounced back 4,000 points. HDFC Bank has been the biggest contributor to the Nifty Bank's recovery, contributing over 900 points, or 7 percent to this rally. ICICI Bank also rose 7 percent during this period.  Going forward, a rise in foreign investor inflows, a decline in US bond yields, and the optimistic anticipation of no further rate hikes will fuel gains for Indian equities.  Also Read: Why Nifty, Bank Nifty hit new all-time highs; what brought biggest single day gains since Oct'22  &quot;I think that catch-up for the banking sector is going to come,&quot; Holland told Moneycontrol, adding that after the recent move by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to increase the risk weight on consumer loans, some of the bad news has been baked in. &quot;Now, you can see that big catch-up for the banking sector, given its weightage, that would lead to good strong performance for the Nifty,&quot; he said.  Andrew Holland's top bets  Within the sector, Andrew Holland prefers private sector lenders more than PSU banks as the management of public sector banks keeps changing every three years. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are Holland's top picks among the private sector banks.  Banks have attractive valuations and are backed with clean and healthy balance sheets, strong asset quality, and are witnessing robust credit growth, according to analysts. The financial space looks very compelling on a risk-reward basis as these stocks have not participated meaningfully in the last year and a half, they said.

Bank’s margin is higher by 30bps at 4.1% vs its base guidance of 3.8%; it targets retaining some structural gains due to organic PSL build-up via Bharat Banking and a better portfolio mix, despite rising CoF.

The central bank has raised credit risk weights on unsecured consumer loans by increasing the capital requirements for such loans as concerns have been growing over these borrowings.  At 10:00 am, Axis Bank shares were trading 2.47 percent lower at Rs 1,000.90 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). So far in 2023, the stock has rallied 6 percent, underperforming benchmark Nifty 50 which has risen around 8.5 percent during this period.

CLSA and Citi denoted up to a whopping 230 basis points (bps) impact in the CAR (capital adequacy ratio) of lenders.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  According to foreign brokerage Citi, Unsecured credit risk weight rise adversely impacts Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) by 36 bps for Axis Bank. Note that CET1 is the highest quality of regulatory capital, as it absorbs losses immediately when they occur. The tier I capital consists mainly of share capital and disclosed reserves.  The fall in Axis Bank share price also comes after RBI took stringent action against the bank, imposing a monetary penalty of nearly Rs 91 lakh. The penalty is a consequence of Axis Bank's non-compliance with specific directives outlined by the RBI.  This regulatory action stems from the findings of the statutory inspection for supervisory evaluation, conducted by the RBI with reference to Axis Bank's financial position as of March 31, 2022.  The inspection revealed several deficiencies in regulatory compliance, including the bank's failure to preserve records related to customer identification and addresses in specific cases.

Core credit cost was at 46 bps vs. 54 bps q-o-q annualised. NIMs surprised positively as the increase in the cost of funds (+14 bps q-o-q) was fully offset by higher yield on advances.

Additionally, lower slippages and strong net interest income (NII) were also some of the key positives delivered by the private sector lender, noted analysts.  In the past one month, Axis Bank stock has remained flat as against a 3 percent decline in the Sensex benchmark.  Follow live blog for all the market action  Axis Bank surprises with strong margin in Q2 FY24, tailwinds to continue  Global brokerage firm CLSA shared a ‘buy’ rating for Axis Bank with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share, adding that the Q2 margin performance fared better than peers. “One of the key positive was Axis Bank’s stable net interest margin (NIM) performance, as peer lenders like ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank saw margin contraction in Q2,” they said.  Axis Bank’s NIM expanded by 15 basis points (bps) on-year to 4.1 percent in Q2FY24 amid lower cost of funds. Sequentially, it was flat.  Moreover, the management guided for limited increase in funding costs over coming quarters, which could further support margins going ahead.  Asset quality, loan growth help Axis Bank Q2 profit growth  Jefferies analysts' said that Axis Bank's firm asset quality and steady loan growth helped to book a healthy profit in Q2. However, growth in operating expenses due to investments in new technology, employee increments, and expenses related to Citi integration weighed on profit, they added.  Also read: Axis Bank Q2 preview: Profit likely to rise 7%, Citi integration to be keenly watched  Axis Bank’s net profit rose 10 percent on-year to Rs 5,864 crore in Q2FY24 aided by 19 percent on-year rise in net interest income (NII) and controlled provisions.  Jefferies further said that the bank’s return on equity (RoE) of 18 percent during the quarter bodes well for the future as well. Valuation-wise, analysts said adjusted price-to-book (PB) at 1.5 times (x) FY25 is attractive.  ALSO READ: Axis Bank’s retail gameplan would soon need a check on unsecured book  Axis Bank asset quality robust, but analysts concerned about deposits growth  Meanwhile, analysts at Motilal Oswal leaned support towards Axis Bank’s healthy asset quality picture. “Asset quality of Axis Bank remains robust with slippages declining further and recoveries remaining strong,” the brokerage firm said, sharing a ‘buy’ rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,150 per share.  The lender’s non-performing assets (NPA) declined by 77 bps on-year to 1.7 percent in Q2, while net NPA slipped 15 bps YoY to 0.36 percent.  However, analysts remained watchful of deposit accretion of the bank as it will be critical to sustain healthy loan growth (highest in over 7 years). Axis Bank’s loan book grew 23 percent on-year in Q2, whereas deposit growth was up 18 percent on-year. As a result, CASA ratio stood at 44 percent in the September-ended quarter.  “We change our earnings estimates by -1.7/2.1 percent for FY24/FY25 and expect FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.9/16.6 percent for Axis Bank,” added analysts at Motilal Oswal.

While Axis Bank fell more than 2 percent, SBI shares were down 1.5 percent intraday on the NSE after the international brokerage house lowered their ratings on concerns of a rise in credit losses. &quot;Indian banking sector's risk-reward is turning equal,&quot; UBS said.  &quot;We raise our credit cost forecasts for the India banks we cover by 5-10bps in FY25,&quot; UBS said in its report, adding that SBI and Axis Bank's Return on Assets (RoAs) are more sensitive to credit cost changes than large peers. The brokerage estimates FY25 EPS for SBI and Axis Bank at 22 percent and 10 percent below consensus.  SBI downgraded on narrow margins, rising credit costs   From the 'buy' rating, UBS has downgraded SBI to 'sell', and cut the target price to Rs 530 from Rs 740 as it raised credit costs by 10bps and cut the EPS by 5 percent. The downgrade is attributed to anticipated declines in RoA and Return on Equity (RoE) by FY25. The bank's narrowing margins and increasing credit costs are seen driving these potential declines.  Follow out market blog to catch all the live action  Considering relatively low CET1 versus peers, potential regulatory tightening on unsecured loans would limit loan growth or trigger dilution for SBI. The stock at one-time FY25 price to book value does not appear expensive but a likely decline in profitability may result in downside, analysts at UBS noted. The brokerage warns that SBI could face escalating credit costs, and its ability to manage these costs while maintaining profitability will be crucial in the coming years.  Limited upside seen in Axis Bank  The Axis Bank stock has been downgraded to 'neutral' and its price target has been lowered to Rs 1,100 from Rs 1,150. The private lender's margins are peaking and credit costs are near bottom. Its RoA is set to to contract in FY25, said UBS. In the next three quarter, single-digit growth is expected in net interest income (NII). The brokerage sees limited upside potential in the stock.  In the last one year, the Axis Bank stock has risen around 24 percent, outperforming the Nifty Bank index which has risen 14 percent during this period.

Rising crude stokes inflation fears  &quot;The selling was broad-based, as investors are on alert given the rise of oil prices. If crude continues to stay above the 90 USD level, it will be a threat to inflation and boil the operational margins” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.  Globally, the US GDP data and the Federal Reserve chief’s speech would be closely tracked for clues to future trend. Currently, the combination of higher interest rates and US bond yields is influencing FIIs to stay in the sell mode, he said.

At close, the index was down 59 points at 20,133. Global equities fell on Monday as growth concerns tested investors' nerves ahead of a week packed with central bank meetings in five countries. Traders took some cash off the table ahead of the policy decisions that will reveal how major central banks view progress in the fight against inflation.  For the Nifty, primary and intermediate trend remains positive as it has been holding above the 50, 100 and 200-day EMA (exponential moving average). On the weekly chart, the 14-week RSI (relative strength index) is at 71.64, which again suggests it is not extremely overbought and there is scope for more upsides in intermediate term.  On the derivatives side, we have seen aggressive Put writing at 19,800-20,000 levels, which coincides with the 11 and 20-day moving averages placed at 19,918 and 19,771. Therefore, on the downside, 19,770-20,000 could now be considered as an immediate support for the Nifty.  While we do not rule out the possibility of a running correction in the next few days, we believe that the Nifty could move towards intermediate upside targets of 20,600. This target is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci extension of the recent up-move from the lows of March 2023 to the highs of July 2023. Therefore, traders are advised to accumulate longs on decline with a stop-loss at 19,770 on the Nifty on a closing basis.  Broad market indices like Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices have underperformed the Nifty during the last week. We believe that they may continue to underperform for the coming few weeks before they resume their uptrend. In terms of strategy, we recommend having a bias towards Largecaps.  Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:  AMI Organics: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,302 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,220 | Targets: Rs 1,393-1,460 | Return: 12 percent  The stock price has broken out on the monthly chart by surpassing the multiple top resistance of Rs 1,270 odd levels. Momentum Oscillators like - RSI (11) and MFI (money flow index 10) are sloping upwards and placed above 50 on the weekly chart, indicating strength in the current uptrend of the stock.

","By Kunal Shah, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative analyst at LKP Securities  Bulls successfully regained control from bears, pushing Nifty back above the 20,000 mark. On September 13, it closed above this threshold, marking a historic closing high for Nifty. The prevailing sentiment remains optimistic, contingent on Put writers safeguarding the 19,900 levels. A drop below 19,900 could unsettle Put writers, potentially triggering market corrections.  On the upside, the 20,100-20,150 range is poised to act as resistance. A clear breakthrough above 20,150 might propel Nifty into a sustained upward trend.  The bulls took charge and dominated the market, resulting in the formation of a Bullish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the Bank Nifty index. This pattern signifies a potential reversal of the previous bearish sentiment.  Follow our market blog for LIVE D-St action and business update  The lower-end support for the index is now established in the range of 45,700-45,600, serving as a strong cushion for the bulls and providing a crucial level of defense against any downward pressure.

The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) is currently trading above the 60 level, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the stock.  For potential investors, the lower-end support for NOCIL is at Rs 235, which is expected to act as a strong foundation, providing support to any potential price declines.

It has a target price of Rs 1,175 for the stock, which represents a potential upside of over 19 percent from its current level of Rs 982.  “Axis Bank has reported steady traction in retail business with the mix increasing to 58 percent in 1Q FY24 from 50 percent in FY19. This occurred even as the bank consciously lowered the share of mortgage in its retail mix to 43 percent from 47 percent in FY22,”Motilal Oswal said in a report.  The proportion of higher-yielding retail loans – comprising mainly personal loans, rural loans, credit cards, and small business banking (SBB) – has increased to 28 percent.  “The rural and semi-urban market remains a key focus area, which we believe should enable sustainable loan growth over the medium term,” it added.  Business per branch of Axis Bank has improved to Rs 3.7 billion in FY23 from Rs 3.2 billion in FY22, while business per employee has also improved to Rs 195 million in FY23 from Rs 178 million in FY22.  Catch all the market action in our live blog  The management has guided to add up to 500 branches in FY24, as it expects branches to play an important role in deposit mobilization from new customers.  Retail and transaction banking fees now form ~93 percent of total fees, signifying the granularity of fee income. This was primarily driven by card fees (up 51 percent YoY) and other retail assets related fees (up 23 percent YoY), which together constituted around 68 percent of total fees.  Axis Bank has also completed the acquisition of Citibank India’s consumer business, including its credit cards, deposits, wealth management, loans, and other retail banking operations. It has also acquired the NBFC business of Citicorp Finance (India).  Motilal Oswal further said the lender’s asset quality has improved significantly over the past few years, with slippages moderating to 1.9 percent in FY23 versus 8.2 percent in FY18, which led to a decline in the GNPA ratio to 2.2 percent in FY23 from 5.1 percent in FY20.  “Axis Bank remains focused on building a stronger, consistent, and sustainable franchise. With asset quality issues behind, slippages and credit costs are likely to stay under control,” it added.  Shares of Axis Bank are up 4 percent on YTD basis, though the 1-year return stands at 30 percent.

The bank has laid special emphasis on increasing the mix of retail deposits. In FY23, it reported 21% growth in CASA deposits, surpassing its peers. This facilitated a 100bp improvement in the daily average CASA mix, reaching 44%. The bank continues to invest in digital initiatives to ensure sustainable long-term growth. In FY23, the bank sourced 55% of personal loans digitally vs. 22% in FY18. About 24% of credit cards were also issued through a fully digital end-to-end process. Also, the bank’s market share in credit card has improved to 14.7%, strengthening its position as the fourth largest credit card issuer in the country. The concentration of top 20 advances/deposits improved 105bp/110bp YoY to 8.1%/9.0% in FY23 (11.8% in FY21). The bank has shifted its deposit strategy to ‘CASA + retail term deposits’ and has consciously pruned bulk deposits. AXSB has a strong management team and a well-articulated strategy aimed at delivering 18% sustainable RoE. Asset quality has improved significantly and we estimate RoA to recover further aided by steady loan growth and moderation in opex ratios.  Outlook We thus estimate RoA/RoE to be ~1.8%/~15.9% by FY25 and we reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR1,175 (1.8x FY25E ABV + INR100 for subs).

The global brokerage firm hosted CEO of Axis Bank for investor meetings in the US, and released a report based on the discussions.  &quot;One of the key areas of focus for the bank is improvement in funding mix through increase in share of retail deposits (term and savings deposits) to be in line with best-in-class peers: Towards this, there is a broader focus on improved customer experience, reorientation of branch staff, focus on corporate salary accounts and digital banking platforms,&quot; the report said.  This process can take 18-24 months to play out in terms of improved funding mix and lower cost of funds. Over the past year, rise in share of retail funds has helped reduce outflow rate (now in line with larger banks), which has in turn helped grow loans.  The bank management believes that credit growth for banking can sustain around 12-13 percent levels and that Axis Bank can continue to grow at a 4-5 percentage points higher rate (so 16-19 percent).  &quot;The pricing environment in corporate lending has improved, which allows for greater participation for Axis. Capex cycle is seeing some improvement, but banks and promoters (in general) will remain cautious about pushing capex,&quot; Jefferies said.  The management also reiterated that the bank doesn't need to raise capital given its CET-1 CAR of 14 percent and ROE (annualised) of 19 percent in 10FY24.  &quot;We expect the bank to deliver 16 percent CAGR in profit over FY23-26, with ROE of 18 percent.

Any retracement towards Fibonacci 23.6 percent to 38.2 percent of the rise will be a good opportunity to buy stocks in the midcap and smallcap segments, he advises.  On the pharma, the Chartered Market Technician with vast experience in the capital markets advised that it is a good opportunity to use dips in the sector and stocks as opportunity to buy as the overall medium-to-long-term trend is intact.  The pharma sector has come out of eight years of consolidation and such correction is a healthy sign for the next sustainable up-move, he believes. Excerpts from the interview:  Do you expect the Nifty to decisively break the 19,000 mark this week? Do you see another 5 percent correction from here on?  The Nifty has been breaking below the prior weekly low since the past four weeks. Pullback we saw last week also got sold and prices closed near the lower end of the range. Now, further break below 19,220 can open targets for Gann level of 18,838. Over past few days, prices have been stuck within the range of 19,590 – 19,250 and on August 25, we broke the range there by suggesting that the trend is bearish as of now unless we see close back above the high of August 24, which is at 19,585 levels.  Selling is visible across sectors over the last week. So, over the short term, we might be in sell on rise market but we might see a cut to 18,838 or Head &amp;amp; Shoulder pattern target of 18,620 as long as prices sustain below 19,400 followed by 19,585 levels.  Also read: Primary market schedule | 4 IPOs to be launched, 6 listings next week  Bank Nifty also showed reversal on the last day of the week as the index found a hurdle near 45,000 levels with support near 43,600. This week, one has to be cautious and wait for this range to break for a trend in that direction. Bank Nifty can provide leading indication for Nifty as well.  Two stocks that can outperform Nifty50 this week, and why?  Axis Bank showed a strong rise in prior week after correcting to the levels of Rs 928 and is on the verge of giving a break above the prior swing high at Rs 990 levels. Any close above this can result into a fresh rally on the upside with the targets of Rs 1,050 levels or higher. The stock also be starting the 3rd wave on upside as per Elliott wave pattern.  Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers has shown a strong pick-up in volumes on the previous three days along with an impulsive rise. The Overall chart pattern looks good as stock has given breakout above the price action resistance area of Rs 120. We can expect pattern target on upside to Rs 135 with Rs 117 as important support.  Do you see more correction in the Nifty Pharma? It has fallen further after recent several days of consolidation...  The Nifty Pharma index has rallied from the lows made in March 2023 at 11,540 to the highs of 15,750 levels. That is a rally of more than 36 percent in just over five months and we are witnessing retracement of that up-move.  Also read: 10 most popular large-cap stocks among PMS to withstand volatility  It is a good opportunity to use dips in the pharma sector and stocks as opportunity to buy as the overall medium-to-long-term trend is intact.

Over near term, support for the sector is at 14,200 which is also 38.2 percent retracement of the entire rise. So, over the short term, profit-booking is possible in this sector but medium-to-long-term investors can nibble stocks from the space on every dip.  What do you make out of the ongoing consolidation in the Nifty Auto index?  The Nifty Auto index has been moving in a range since the past few weeks but stock-specific action is clearly witnessed in the midcap and smallcap auto ancillary space. CNX Auto is trading near 15,363 after forming a high at 15,912. We see time correction with minor price correction so far.

Do you see the relentless buying continuing in the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices in September too?  Both Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices have shown a rise of nearly 35 percent since March 24. Overall, the medium-to-long-term trend for this sector is positive but in September we are expecting consolidation or profit booking. There is a possibility that the market will take a breather over the near term before resuming the upward trajectory.  Also read: Sanjay Bembalkar of Union AMC identifies 3 segments in India with fantastic growth runway  So, for traders or investors, use the dips to buy to play out the medium-to-long-term growth story. Over the near term also, not all stocks from this sector might show a sharp correction. It is best to buy leaders that have outperformed during the current rise once they relieve their overbought state. So, any retracement towards Fibonacci 23.6 percent to 38.2 percent of the rise will be a good opportunity to buy the stocks in this sector. In a nutshell, we expect consolidation or profit-booking in September before the strong up move resumes again.  Do you think Apar Industries is done with the rally?  Apar Industries has shown an exponential rise in just over a year. The stock was trading near Rs 556 levels in May 2022 and touched the high of Rs 5,350 on August 21. This is 10 times increase in the stock price. The stock is still trading at 26 times its PE multiple which means the earnings momentum has been strong that backed the exponential rise.  Short-term profit-booking is not ruled out but medium-to-long-term investors can stay invested as long as the stock does not break the support near the Rs 4,000 levels. There will be natural tendency for traders to book profit seeing such exorbitant returns but wealth can be created by sitting tight in these type of stocks unless the fundamental or technical pattern has changed.

There has been raging debate over management of inflation in India that shot up in July led by cereal and vegetable prices. It rose above RBI’s target range of 2-6 percent to hit a 15-month high of 7.44 percent.  “The MPC is now targeting 4 percent plus minus 2. There was a belief that the moment inflation gets below 4 percent, MPC will cut rates – that was the wrong expectation to start with. Therefore, I think rates will stay on hold,” said Mishra, speaking to CNBC TV-18. .  The sharp rise in inflation was driven by higher prices for vegetables, with their index rising 38 percent month-on-month, resulting in a 6.7 percent sequential rise in Consumer Food Price Index and a 2.9 percent increase in the overall CPI.  However, prices of some vegetables, especially tomatoes, have come down since then and now it is available at a third of its peak price in July. On the other hand, some vegetables, such as onions, have become dearer.  There was some more good news on the core inflation front, which eased slightly to 4.9 percent in July from 5.1 percent in June. Mishra also said one should focus on this number.  “From India's inflation report, the core inflation numbers were better and that we need to focus on,” said Mishra.  Also Read: NCCF, NAFED to sell tomatoes at Rs 40 per kg from August 20  For the RBI's revised forecast of 6.2 percent for July-September to be met, CPI inflation should average 5.6 percent in August and September. This looks unlikely at the moment, with economists seeing inflation remaining elevated around 6.5 percent in August - data for which will be released on September 12 - given the price developments so far.  Thus, expectations of a rate cut have also vanished.  “This expectation many had that interest rates will start falling early next calendar year, I think that was totally misplaced. Thankfully that expectation is now getting corrected. The fear that this will again necessitate another round of rate hikes is not something I buy into,” said Mishra.  Not a big impact on financial cos  Mishra believes the high inflation, and consistently high rates, will not be a big issue for lenders such as non banking financial companies (NBFCs) and banks.  “The longer rates stay on hold, the higher the effective rates are. So, if repo rates stay unchanged for a year, there will be effective tightening,” said Mishra. “I think financial (companies) will do pretty well.”  Also Read: Banks to maintain 10% incremental CRR from August 12, says RBI governor  He also refused to read too much into the imposition of 10 percent incremental CRR (cash reserve ratio), which is likely to suck liquidity out of the system.

For the transaction, Axis Bank was required to give notice to the fair trade regulator. However, it failed to do so, according to the order.  &quot;It is apparent that the acquisition of stake in CSC e-Governance by Axis Bank was neither solely as an investment nor can be considered to be in ordinary course of business.  &quot;Therefore, the AxisCSC e-Governance acquisition is not eligible for the benefit of the Item 1 of Schedule I (combination regulation) and accordingly, it is immaterial whether the transaction led to acquisition of control or not,&quot; the regulator said.  Thus, CCI observed that no determination is warranted whether the transaction led to the acquisition of control or not in this matter. Accordingly, the commission found that in relation to the AxisCSC e-Governance acquisition, Axis Bank failed to comply with the regulations.  To avail the benefit of combination rules, the acquirer should not be a member of the board of directors, does not have a right to nominate a director and should not participate in the affairs or management of the enterprise whose shares or voting right are being acquired, as per the order.  However, Axis Bank had/has representation on the board of CSC e-Governance. Further, it had intention to have representation on the board of directors of the company and participate in its management or affairs, thereby it is not eligible for the benefit of the rules.  Axis Bank is required to pay the penalty within 60 days from the date of order, as per order passed on August 9.

axis,2023-08-18T11:13:08+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"Mid-day Mood | Indices down on food inflation worries, weak global cues","Analysts pointed out that the rising US bond yields continue to create havoc in world currency markets, fuelling a sell-off in equity markets.","Domestic indices were on a downhill drive for the fourth straight week on August 18 amid rising worries over food inflation and weak global cues, especially from the US markets.  Analysts pointed out that the rising US bond yields continue to create havoc in world currency markets, fuelling a sell-off in equity markets. The relatively weak macroeconomic scenario – rising domestic inflation, FII fund outflow, China slowdown and the US Fed hints of more rate hikes to contain inflation - is also prompting investors to book profits.  As of 10.28am, the BSE flagship Sensex traded down 271.52 points or 0.42 percent at 64,879.50. The NSE Nifty was down 88.45 points or 0.46 percent at 19,276.80. Broader market indices, which have been resilient in the past weeks, also saw brisk selling. Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 traded lower by 0.4 percent and 0.2 percent.  IT stocks were among the biggest drags on the indices, followed by realty and oil and gas. Banks, especially public sector lenders, were resilient, while some media stocks also saw demand.  Axis Bank and Adani Ports were biggest gainers in the Nifty, while Wipro led the losers along with its peers Tech Mahindra and TCS.  US dollar  Despite a pullback from two-month highs, high dollar levels are a worry for the Indian currency as it managed to hold recent gains. The 10-year US yield dropped to 4.25 percent, having made a new 10-month high of 4.33 percent on Thursday. Resilient US economic data has made investors worried that the US interest rates are likely to remain high for longer and that policymakers may not be done with hikes.  Weak economies  Data early on Friday showed that Japan's core inflation slowed down in July, a result that is likely to support market wagers that the Bank of Japan is in no hurry to phase out monetary easing anytime soon.  Adding to concerns of a deepening crisis in China's property sector, China Evergrande, one of the country's biggest real estate developers, on Thursday filed for protection from creditors in a US bankruptcy court.  China stocks have shed 10 percent from their highs in January, as dismal economic data laid bare the stuttering post-pandemic recovery, with investors remaining unimpressed with just piecemeal support measures from policymakers.  Global markets  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were up 0.1 percent after hitting a nine-month low the session before. It was, however, headed for a weekly loss of 2.8 percent, the third straight week of declines. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.4 percent and was down 3 percent on the week, pushing pressure on Indian stocks.  The S&amp;amp;P 500 lost 33.97 points, or 0.77 percent, to 4,370.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 143.75 points, or 1.07 percent, to 13,330.88. The S&amp;amp;P 500 is down 2.7 percent over the past three sessions, its deepest three-session drop since mid-March. The Nasdaq's 3.4 percent drop over three days marks its deepest three-day drop since February.  Technical view  Technically, prices persist in oscillating within a notably narrow range of 200 points – 19,300 to 19,500. Traders are opting for cautious positions on the index front, awaiting a catalyst for a momentum-driven movement. The trading range is defined by two moving averages, with the 50 EMA defending prices at lower levels and the 20 EMA capping the prices at higher levels.  “Traders are advised to monitor these levels closely and, rather than being swayed by market movements, should engage within this range until a decisive momentum breakout occurs beyond the mentioned limits. Furthermore, the trajectory of the market's future remains in sync with global market developments; hence, vigilant observation of these developments is crucial,” said Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivatives, Angel One.

NIM boost was driven by (1) strong QoQ growth in higher margin segments of PL, CC and SBB (2) deliberate slowdown in housing (3) 6% QoQ fall in LCR and (4) lower deposit growth of 0.6% QoQ resulting in higher LDR. RTD growing by 4.5% QoQ was another positive. Balance sheet construct is being calibrated towards higher margin segments and granular deposits which could slightly affect loan growth. However, this should bode well over medium term from a profitability perspective. CITI integration costs and business investments would keep opex elevated. Outlook For FY24/25E we raise NIM and opex while reduce provisions resulting in ~3% PAT upgrade. With likely RoA of 1.7% for FY25E, valuation discount to ICICIB (27%) should narrow. We maintain multiple at 2.2x but raise TP to Rs1,170 from Rs1,140. Reiterate ‘BUY’.

axis,2023-07-22T10:24:07+05:30,Hiral Thanawala,"Why Axis Bank stopped redemption of reward points, selectively?",Banks and credit card companies frown when users earn faster reward points through dubious means such as swiping personal cards for business purposes. Axis Bank did the same. Here’s what happened ,"On July 21 morning, several Axis Bank credit-card holders got an email from the private lender, saying it had suspended the redemption of their reward points, a big attraction for users. As the news spread, some more Axis Bank customers raised similar concerns on Twitter.  “… a pattern of non-personal usage of your credit card(s) has been observed for the transactions undertaken by you with the following merchant(s), BSPL, Spay Tech Pvt Ltd, Slenpay Pvt Ltd, etc,” the email, a copy of which was reviewed by Moneycontrol,  said.  As per the bank’s policies, the credit cards can only be used for “your personal expenses and purposes, and any other transaction (including for business and commercial purposes) is prohibited under the Axis Bank’s card member agreement... ” the mail said.  The mail suggests that the bank noticed users spending money on expenses that are not usually allowed as they earn reward points unfairly.  “Business spends on personal credit cards are against terms &amp;amp; conditions and Axis Bank seems to have targeted users with transactions on specific payment gateways that are used for Business Payments,” said Tejas Ghongadi, Co-Founder, The Points Code.  The Points Code is a platform that helps credit-card users get maximum benefits from credit-card rewards and redemptions.  Axis Bank's decision to block access to redeem reward points for some users engaged in non-personal spending is a commendable step towards maintaining the sustainability of its rewards programme, said Ankur Mittal, co-founder and chief technology officer, Card Insider, a platform that tracks credit-card business.  “By preventing misuse of personal cards for business expenses, the bank ensures that genuine users can continue benefiting from the rewards,” Mittal said.   Source: Axis Bank  A history of blocking cards?  Experts who track credit cards say that Axis Bank keeps a close vigil on suspicious spending patterns. In March 2023, it sent suspected commercial use notifications to the high-networth individuals (HNIs) holders of cards such as Axis Magnus and Axis Reserve.  “The bank also has a history of canceling the cashback cards such as Axis Ace and Flipkart Axis Bank credit card if they were found used for business purpose,” said Sumanta Mandal, Founder, TechnoFino, a platform that tracks the Indian credit card industry.  Moneycontrol reviewed one such email that a customer received early this year where the bank asked invoices or proof to prove that all the transactions done in December 2022 and January were for personal use only. Failing which, the bank warned of blocking the cards.  Similarly, in June 2023, the bank informed some customers that their cards were blocked and reward redemption suspended temporarily, as they were suspicious of using them for business purposes, Mandal said.  Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify the veracity of these emails.  “While it may be a good idea to prevent misuse, there are reports of genuine spenders also receiving such notices, which is concerning,” Mandal said.  Ghongadi said some people were gaming the system to make money or earn reward points without actual spends, which is an unethical practice.  Also read | Higher fees, lower reward points: Axis Bank cuts back on Magnus, Reserve credit card benefits  Non-compliance with terms, conditions   While applying for a credit card, a customer agrees to certain terms and conditions set forth by the issuer. If these are violated, the issuer can cancel the card.  “This could include using the credit card for illegal activities such as for gambling, money laundering, using the personal credit card for business transactions, or providing false information on the credit card application,” Mandal said.  To avoid this mistake, read and understand the terms and conditions of your credit card. Utilise your personal credit card only for personal expenses and refrain from using it for any business-related expenses or reselling goods.

If you receive such an email from the bank or the credit card company, you must try and produce invoices of goods and services you paid for through the card.

You can also use phone banking to get in touch with your bank.  Also read | Higher spending, missed payments? Your credit card may be cancelled  Keep personal and business separate  Experts say it is not a good idea to mix business and personal expenses on your personal credit card.  Personal credit cards are meant for personal use and the benefits and rewards are optimised based on individual usage.  “Most issuers have separate business credit cards that are specifically optimised for businesses and have better rewards and benefits for business users,” said Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar.com.  Proper use of a business credit card helps build business credit and also offers a chance to earn additional rewards and benefits.  Many banks draw a strict line between personal and business use of a personal credit card and outline them in their terms and conditions.

It has also removed a host of spends that were earlier for a cashback, thereby making the card less attractive than before","Axis Bank has revised the features of a popular co-branded credit card, i.e., Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card. The revised features come into effect from August 12. “As of date, Axis Bank has made changes to the product features of only the Flipkart Axis Bank credit card with effect from 12th August 2023,” said an Axis Bank spokesperson.  Here are the key changes in features of the Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card that the bank has announced.  Change in the Cashback earned  Effective from August 12, spending towards flight and hotel payments on Flipkart and spends on Myntra shall be eligible for 1.5 percent unlimited cashback from 5 percent cashback. This means that earlier whatever your spends were, you used to get 5 percent of that amount back. Now your cashback will come down to 1.5 percent.

However, the bank only confirmed the reduction of benefits of the Flipkart Axis Bank credit card.

axis,2023-07-03T11:14:08+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"10 best bets when bulls rule the Street, benchmarks reach uncharted territories","The benchmark Nifty is likely to march towards 19,300-19,500 levels in coming days, as long as it holds the 19,000 mark, which is an immediate support, then 18,800 levels, experts said","Bulls took full control over Dalal Street since later part of the last week and pushed the benchmark indices to uncharted territory on June 30 as we have seen buying across sectors with strong lifting from banking and financial services and technology stocks.  The Nifty50 has seen a breakout of upward sloping resistance trendline adjoining previous record high levels (October 2021 and December 2022) in the opening itself on Friday and remained above the same throughout session. The index jumped 2.8 percent to end at record closing high of 19,189 and formed robust bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts, with maintaining higher highs for 14th straight session.  Even the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) gave bullish crossover on all timeframes, which is a positive sign. Hence, the index is likely to march towards 19,300-19,500 levels in coming days, as long as it holds 19,000 mark, which is an immediate support, then 18,800 levels, experts said.  &quot;Price-wise, we can clearly see a configuration of ‘V’ pattern which has been broken out in the upward direction. The theoretical target of this is much higher but with the short to medium term view, we continue to remain upbeat on the market,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.  As far as levels are concerned, he feels the Nifty can be heading towards 19,350 – 19,500 in the forthcoming week. However, one needs to be very selective going ahead because the low hanging fruit is gone for the momentum traders, he advised.  In between, &quot;we may see bout of profit booking, but the directional bias remains strongly bullish till the time 18,600 is not violated. Before this, 19,000 followed by 18,800 are to be seen as key supports,&quot; Sameet said.  Looking ahead, Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President of Master Capital Services also feels the Nifty prices seem poised to continue their upward trajectory towards the levels of 19,400 and 19,500. In the event of any correctional fall, approximately around the 19,000 mark, it may present an opportunity to initiate fresh long positions, he said.  Here’s a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on June 28 closing prices:  Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities  Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 265.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 238 | Target: Rs 320 | Return: 20.5 percent  After correcting from an intermediate high of Rs 295 tested in November 2022, Biocon found support around Rs 191 levels in March 2023. These are strong supports as they also roughly coincide with previous intermediate lows.  The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA (small moving average). Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI (relative strength index) too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 263-267 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 238 and target at Rs 320.    Indian Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 292.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 276 | Target: Rs 320 | Return: 9.4 percent  Indian Bank has shown relative strength last week. While the Nifty has gained 2.8 percent last week, Indian bank has gained a healthy 5.42 percent. In the process, the stock has closed above its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 290-294 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 276 and target at Rs 320.    Indiabulls Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 123.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 113 | Target: Rs 140 | Return: 13.5 percent  After touching a low of Rs 91.8 in March 2023, Indiabulls Housing Finance has gradually climbed higher and made higher tops and higher bottoms. In the process, there has also been a moving average crossover as the 20-day SMA has moved above the 50-day SMA.  This positive signal combined with the fact that the stock also closed on Friday above the 200-day EMA on the back of above average volumes, augurs well for the uptrend to continue. Intermediate momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. Recommend a buy between Rs 121-125 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 113 and target at Rs 140.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 987.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 940 | Target: Rs 1,050-1,150 | Return: 16.5 percent  The stock is in a long-term breakout. In the medium term, the stock corrected to retest the breakout level, which stood at Rs 820. However, it soon reversed back and set a new all-time high, which other banks are missing.  The stock is doing well and moving towards Rs 1,050 and Rs 1,150 levels in the coming few weeks or months. The strategy should be to buy 50 percent at current levels and the rest at Rs 965. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 940.    LTIMindtree: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,197.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,050 | Target: Rs 5,500-5,800 | Return: 11.6 percent  The stock has formed an ascending triangle after falling from the high of Rs 7,588. It is a base-building structure and a rejection of Rs 5,050 on monthly and quarterly closes above it will result in a rally towards Rs 5,800 with key resistance at Rs 5,500.  In the short term, the strategy should be to buy at Rs 5,200 and place a stop-loss at Rs 5,050.    Century Textiles and Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 861.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 770 | Target: Rs 1,025 | Return: 19 percent  By closing above Rs 850 level, it has completed the corrective pattern on the long-term chart, which will pull the stock towards Rs 1,025, to the minimum level. At the maximum level, it seems possible to get Rs 1,200.  However, to get a better reward for the risk, traders should buy the stock in two tranches. The first tranche should be bought at the current price and the second tranche at Rs 800. Place stop-loss at Rs 770 for the given target.    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 987.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 955 | Target: Rs 1,020-1,045 | Return: 6 percent  This stock has been forming a ‘Higher Top, Higher Bottom’ structure and is trading in a rising channel. The 20-DEMA has been acting as a support in corrections, and the stock seems to have resumed its upmove from its support zone.  Hence, positional traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 990-980. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 955 while the targets could be expected around Rs 1,020 and Rs 1,045.    Amara Raja Batteries: Buy | LTP: Rs 681 | Stop-Loss: Rs 648 | Target: Rs 720-740 | Return: 8.6 percent  The stock has witnessed a gradual upmove in last few weeks and has now given a breakout above its previous swing high resistance in Friday’s session. The breakout has been supported with higher than daily average volumes and the RSI (relative strength index) oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum.  Hence, traders can buy this stock on in the range of Rs 682-675 for potential near term target of Rs 720 and Rs 740. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below Rs 648    Expert: Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza Portfolio  Century Plyboards: Buy | LTP: Rs 662.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 630 | Target: Rs 705 | Return: 6.4 percent  The stock has seen breaking out of a downwards sloping parallel channel pattern on the weekly timeframe with a bullish candlestick above the highs of last nine months which indicates bullish strength.  On the indicator front, the supertrend indicator is indicating a bullish continuation trend which can be used as a confluence towards the bullish view. The Ichimoku Cloud is also suggesting a bullish move as the price is trading above the conversion line, base line and cloud.  Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 72 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50.  Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move in Century Plyboards is possible for target upto Rs 705. One can initiate a buy trade in between the range of Rs 656-661, with a stop-loss of Rs 630 on daily closing basis.  Escorts Kubota: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,248 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,200 | Target: Rs 2,310 | Return: 3 percent  Escorts has seen breaking out of a big Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the daily timeframe with a bullish candlestick and above average volumes, adding to it, the stock is also trading above important EMAs of 20/50/100/200 which indicates strength.  On the indicator front the momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 65 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50 and the Ichimoku Cloud is also suggesting a bullish move as the price is trading above the conversion line, base line and cloud on the daily timeframe.

The supertrend indicator is also indicating a bullish continuation which supports the bullish view. Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 65 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50. The Ichimoku Cloud is also suggesting a bullish move as the price is trading above the conversion line, base line and cloud.

axis,2023-06-26T21:33:11+05:30,PTI,Axis Bank to grow up to 6% faster than the industry in medium to long term: CEO Amitabh Chaudhry,"In March last year, Axis Bank completed the acquisition of Citibank's consumer business and Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) consumer business.","Axis Bank on Monday said it will continue to grow 4-6 per cent faster than the industry in the medium to long term, helped by focus on rural and semi-urban markets, improving digital infrastructure and Citibank India retail business.  Fiscal year 2023 was a breakout year for digital banking platform Axis 2.0 and the early leadership in building proprietary in-house digital native capabilities with full stack engineering, product and a design team of about 400 people have started yielding results, according to Axis Bank Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry.  &quot;Given the powerful integrated platform we are building, we will continue to grow 400 to 600 bps faster than the industry in the medium to long term.  &quot;The significant strides we made during the year on our customer obsession journey, digital capabilities, Bharat Banking and successful acquisition of Citibank India Consumer Business further give us the confidence in sustaining this performance,&quot; he said in a message to shareholders.  In March last year, Axis Bank completed the acquisition of Citibank's consumer business and Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) consumer business.  The positioning in the credit cards business has strengthened with the card advances market share improving by 450 basis points (bps) to 16.3 per cent, led by the acquisition of a quality and complementary credit card franchise.  According to the bank's annual report, the liability franchise received a boost with over 100 bps improvement in CASA ratio and access to over 1,600 Suvidha corporate relationships.  The integration of Citibank India Consumer Business remains well on track with about 3,200 Citi employees now integrated into the Axis organisation structure, it said.  Early traction from the Citibank customer base has been quite positive, it said, adding the interactions with several high-value customers suggest their acknowledgment of the seamless transition, continuation of highest levels of service, access to Axis Bank's extensive network of branches and wide product portfolio under the One Axis umbrella.  &quot;We have already started incremental onboarding of erstwhile 'Suvidha' salary accounts on Axis Bank platform for additional locations across the country where Citi was hitherto not present. While the acquired Citi business being entirely retail runs at a higher cost, it comes with higher return ratios and is ROE accretive post integration,&quot; it said.  It does not impede the ability to deliver aspirational Return on Equity (ROE), the report said.  &quot;We have identified 60+ synergy initiatives across the bank as we look to drive revenue and cost benefits. We believe that this integration between two highly complementary institutions will enable us to create the gold standard in the retail space,&quot; it said.  During the fiscal 2022-23, the report said the bank witnessed strong growth in deposits and advances led by focus on improving quality and granularity across businesses.  On advances, it said, the bank continued to grow faster than the industry with domestic loan book growth of 23 per cent y-o-y.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/axis-bank-to-grow-up-to-6-faster-than-the-industry-in-medium-to-long-term-ceo-amitabh-chaudhry-10861411.html

ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model that interacts with users in a conversational way. It is based on a large language model (LLM), a tool that is trained with massive amounts of data and information to accurately predict conversational behaviour.  Global banks like JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank are planning to use ChatGPT-like chatbots and AI models.  Shetty said the banks can use ChatGPT for conversational and personalised services.  “We have some AI experiments in place which may show results in the next 12-15 months. Alongside these use cases, we may look at using ChatGPT’s enterprise version for chatbot service to provide customised information to our customers,” Shetty said.  Currently, Shetty said that the bank uses AI, machine learning (ML) and data analytics tools for internal calculation purposes, to give recommendations to its customers on their spends and banking services and for some other purposes.  “We have revamped our mobile banking application with AI tools to make it more customised and consumer-oriented,” Shetty said.  Also read: How can banks use ChatGPT?  Why the digital rush?  Banks, both in the private sector and public sector, are working closely on their technology using AI and ML tools to expand digital banking services.  For example, the country’s largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, has its chatbot Eva, which provides customers and non-customers with information about the lender’s banking services.  The country’s largest bank, State Bank of India, in its annual report for FY23 said that it will enhance the use of business analytics, AI and ML in decision-making and operations.  For Axis Bank, the lender in June 2023 launched One View, a service where customers can link their different banking accounts and manage the same on its mobile application.  This comes after the bank has seen growing demand for digital adoption in the last three years. “Around 67 percent of our total service requests are from digital channels,” said Shetty.  The lender’s results for the FY23 showed that the number of digital transactions increased from 91 percent in FY22 to 95 percent. Other than this, digital loans have also grown across some segments by an average of 94 percent on a year-on-year basis.

HDFC Bank in January 2023 partnered with Microsoft to use Microsoft Cloud services for its digital banking needs.  Among public sector banks, Bank of Baroda in May 2023 partnered with Tech Mahindra to enhance its digital solutions concerning customer complaints and queries.  Shetty said that his bank is also looking at enhancing partnerships with more fintech companies.  “After the FLDG (first loss default guarantee) guidelines brought in by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India), there is a regulatory assurance,” Shetty said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/axis-bank-may-use-chatgpt-to-talk-to-customers-10840561.html

axis,2023-06-08T16:29:05+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,"Analysts Call Tracker: Street laps up banking, finance firms in May, shuns IT",The IT pack had to bear the brunt of the Street’s ire as the slowdown in the West and banking crisis in the US led to a forgettable Q4 ,"After a stellar show in the final quarter of FY23, banking and finance companies emerged as the top picks of analysts in May, with heavyweights like SBI, HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank garnering zero &quot;sell&quot; calls.  In contrast, the information technology (IT) pack had to bear the brunt of the Street’s ire as the slowdown in the West and the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry – led to a forgettable quarter  Overall, companies with better earnings visibility scored over their counterparts mired in macro and operational challenges. A bird in hand proved better than two in the bush.  The 'buy' list  The two companies with the perfect optimism score — zero &quot;sell&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; calls — were SBI Life and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.    SBI Life Insurance Company declared a decent set of numbers in Q4. Net profit rose 15 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 777 crore, while net premium income climbed 14 percent to Rs 19,897 crore.  The gross written premium (GWP), a key metric to assess an insurance company's fiscal health, jumped 15 percent for FY23 to Rs 67,320 crore.  Analysts were heartened by the all-round improvement in operational metrics.  “The management is confident of delivering 20–25 percent business growth in FY24E on the back of healthy demand and improving penetration owing to regulatory changes. The diversified distribution channels are expected to contribute significantly to the overall growth of the company,” brokerage KRChoksey said in a note.  Also read: Q4 Results Scorecard: The agony and the ecstasy  The company has been maintaining its cost leadership among the private players over the past few years, despite an increase in operating costs led by increased spending on new initiatives, it added.  Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), too, posted strong quarterly numbers, with revenues soaring 40 percent to Rs 5,797 crore, supported by Haifa port consolidation.  “As APSEZ embarks on becoming India's largest integrated transport utility company by 2030, it is strengthening its capabilities in all logistics segments (ports, warehousing, last mile delivery, ICDs, etc). Hence, it will offer end-t- end service to its customers thereby capturing a higher wallet share and also making the cargo sticky in nature,” analysts at ICICI Direct said.  In tandem with other Adani group stocks, APSEZ has rebounded following the rout triggered by American short-seller Hindenburg Research’s report in late January. The report accused the port-to-power conglomerate of stock manipulation and other wrongdoings. The group has denied the charges.  APSEZ is up over 87 percent over its 52-week low of Rs 394.95 hit on February 3.  The other prominent names figuring on top of analysts’ buy lists include SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Axis Bank.  Banking and finance firms had a standout quarter, marked by robust disbursements despite rising rates, healthy interest margins and stable asset quality.  Public sector banks’ cumulative profit crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in the financial year 2023, with market leader SBI accounting for nearly half of the total earnings.  From posting a net loss of Rs 85,390 crore in 2017-18, PSBs have come a long way.  “The banking sector reported a strong 4Q FY23, driven by healthy loan growth, stable margins, and continued asset quality improvements. There were numerous drivers of credit expansion, with the retail and MSME sectors exhibiting robust growth and the corporate book displaying a healthy rebound,” brokerage Motilal Oswal said.  Declining fortunes    JSW Steel topped the pessimism list with 17 &quot;sell&quot;, nine &quot;hold&quot; and just six &quot;buy&quot; calls.  Its Q4 performance was mixed -- consolidated net profit rose 13 percent to Rs 3,664 crore, even as revenue from operations stayed flat at Rs 46,962 crore.  The company also said it recorded higher-ever crude steel production as well as saleable steel sales during the quarter.  The narrative around the metal space has turned negative, given that China's demand has not really come up despite its post-Covid reopening, while recession fears in the West are further weighing on outlook.  “Though global steel consumption is facing headwinds due to inflationary pressures, high interest rate pressures, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a slowdown in China, steel demand is robust in the domestic market,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.  Also read: Head-to-head: TCS trounces Infosys on all fronts of financials  Some of the most prominent names on this list, however, are IT companies.  India’s IT giants have been clobbered by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West.  “We remain underweight on IT as a sector. The macro overhang witnessed post the unfolding of regional bank issues in the US and EU impacted the growth and margin exit rates in March 2023. The companies which reported March 2023 results… expect some spillover of this weakness into the June 2023 quarter as well,” said Shibani Sircar Kurian, Senior EVP &amp;amp; Head-Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.  Initial expectations of margin improvement have been kept under check on account of negative operating leverage, given the sudden ramp-downs the sector had seen.  “Overall, we expect the operating environment over the next two quarters to remain challenging due to the macro issues and cautious stance of companies on discretionary spends,” she added.  Pharma and auto companies, too, attracted a raft of &quot;sell&quot; and &quot;hold&quot; calls due to factors like revenue collapse post-Covid, negative consumer sentiment due to elevated inflation and demand headwinds.  Also read: Next 2 quarters likely to be challenging for IT sector, says Shibani Kurian of Kotak Mahindra AMC  Road ahead  Analysts say the bulk of Nifty’s earnings growth in FY24 is expected to come from sectors linked to investment and domestic consumption.  “Nifty ended FY23 with an 11% EPS growth on a high base of 34% growth in FY22. Earnings though remain lopsided with BFSI driving almost entire incremental earnings in FY23. With healthy macros, range-bound oil prices, a robust fiscal balance sheets, and moderating inflation, the backdrop for the market is quite optimistic,” Motilal Oswal said.

Today, the Nifty and Sensex turned volatile","The Monetary Policy Committee has maintained the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in its bi-monthly review, while continuing to keep a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook.  Five of the six-member committee voted in favour of maintaining withdrawal of accommodation stance to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.  The interest rate decision by MPC is on expected lines, though few experts were expecting a possibility of change in policy stance to neutral.  The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures.  Headline inflation is projected to decline in 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23 but would still be above the target, warranting continuous vigil, said the RBI, adding the progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard.  The central bank lowered its FY24 inflation projection to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent earlier, and also to 4.6 percent from 5.1 percent for Q1FY24 and to 5.2 percent against 5.4 percent for Q2FY24.  &quot;As the RBI expects inflation to remain within its target range for the rest of the fiscal year, and with growth faring reasonably well, we think the RBI will stay on hold through the rest of FY24,&quot; Rahul Bajoria, MD and Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics at Barclays, said.  RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his policy address emphasised the need to bring down the CPI inflation to its 4 percent target consistently, saying that inflation being within the tolerance band itself was “not good enough”, Rahul pointed out.  The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months, the RBI said.  Also read: Market in see-saw mode post-RBI policy, here are the key factors at play  The central bank has maintained its current financial year growth projection at 6.5 percent, while expecting the real GDP growth for Q1FY24 at 8 percent and 6.5 percent for Q2FY24.  The market seems to have already reacted to the MPC move as the benchmark indices rallied sharply in previous session to hit the highest level of current calendar year.

","Axis Bank Ltd became the fifth Indian lender to cross Rs 3 trillion market capitalisation after its shares hit a fresh record high. The stock gained for ten out of eleven sessions and rose nearly 7 percent during this period.  The stock hit a record high of Rs 981.25 on BSE and rose as much as 1.2 percent intraday with its market cap hitting at Rs 3.01 trillion. At 12.30 pm, Axis Bank was trading at Rs 978 on BSE, up 1 percent from its previous close. Year to date, Axis Bank gained nearly 5 percent.  Earlier, HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, State Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank have touched this milestone.  Also read: Which are Jefferies’s top stock ideas for this June?  Axis Bank reported a significant net loss of Rs 5,728.42 crore for the March quarter due to a one-time impact resulting from the acquisition of Citibank's India consumer business and the non-bank consumer business of Citicorp Finance Ltd.  The bank delivered a strong show in NIM with an expansion of 30bp QoQ to 4.26 percent.  Axis Bank's acquisition of Citibank's India consumer business and the non-bank consumer business of Citicorp Finance Ltd was carried out at a cash value of Rs 11,949 crore. However, when taking into account the additional costs associated with harmonizing provisioning policies, operating expenses, and one-time acquisition expenses, the total impact on Axis Bank during the quarter amounted to Rs 12,489.82 crore.  &quot;We see 16 percent CAGR in earnings (adj. for goodwill write-off due to the acquisition of Citi India's retail business in FY23) over FY23-26 led by top-line growth and some cost synergies. Valuations at 1.8x FY24 adjusted PB are attractive and at a 30 percent discount to ICICI Bank. Hence, we see scope for rerating &amp;amp; maintaining our Buy call &amp;amp; target price of Rs 1,150, including the value of bank at 1.9x Mar-25 adjusted PB,&quot; said Jefferies India in its note to investors.  During the fourth quarter, Axis Bank witnessed an improvement in asset quality. The gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio decreased by 36 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter, standing at 2.02 percent. Similarly, the net NPA ratio showed improvement, declining by 8 basis points sequentially to reach 0.39 percent. Gross slippages, which refer to loans turning into NPAs, amounted to Rs 3,375 crore during the quarter, a decrease from Rs 3,807 crore a year ago. Notably, recoveries and upgrades from NPAs in the quarter totaled Rs 2,699 crore.  According to Jefferies India, during the first and second quarters of FY24, Axis Bank will see a compression in margins as the lagged impact of the increase in funding costs unfolds. A significant portion of this impact will be upfronted during these quarters. However, beyond this period, the net interest margins (NIMs) are anticipated to normalize, approaching levels similar to those seen in FY23 for the full year.  &quot;Axis delivered a stable performance in 3QFY23, driven by margin expansion, high other income and improving cost metrics. Business growth was healthy, led by the corporate segment. Asset quality continued to improve, even as slippages increased marginally, compensated by healthy recoveries and upgrades. The restructured book moderated further, while a higher provisioning buffer provided comfort,&quot; said Motilal Oswal in its recent note.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-bank-becomes-the-fifth-indian-lender-to-cross-rs-3-trillion-market-cap-10757571.html

The buying was seen across sectors during the week with Metal, Pharma, IT and FMCG being the biggest gainers.  As a result, the Nifty50 surged nearly 300 points or 1.6 percent to 18,499.35 during the last week, and formed a strong bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts, with consistently making higher high formation for the ninth consecutive week.  Given the strong momentum and breaking of the last eight-day consolidation, the index is likely to march towards the 18,700-18,800 zone in the coming sessions, with support at 18,400-18,300 levels, experts said. Even the Options data indicated that the Nifty50 may climb towards 18,700-19,000 zone, with crucial support at 18,400-18,200 levels.  &quot;We can see breakout happening on daily time frame chart which is likely to unfold the next leg of the rally to head towards 18,700 first and then if the momentum persists, the new high is imminent soon,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Head of Research for Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  On the flipside, he feels 18,350 followed by 18,200 should be considered as immediate supports.  Ideally, in case of any blip in the current week, Sameet is likely to see buying emerging from the mentioned demand zone. Traders are advised to stick to optimistic stance and use intra-week dips to add bullish bets, he said.  According to, Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio, the coming week is of extreme importance and will decide the trend for the next leg. &quot;The 18,350-18,400 levels are expected to act as a strong support zone and if held in the forthcoming week, the Nifty will start moving towards 19,000 levels,&quot; he said.  On the indicator front, the momentum indicator Relative Strength Index RSI (14) is showing a reading of 67 and Nifty is trading above its 200 EMA at 17,671 which indicates strength.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 26 closing prices:  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equities Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  United Breweries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,460 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,300 | Target: Rs 1,650 | Return: 13 percent  The stock started to diverge positively after hitting new lows in the short term. It was at Rs 1,800 level in December 2022 and overall it fell to Rs 1,350 level in less than five months.  Based on key oscillators such as MACD (moving average convergence divergence) and RSI (relative strength index), it is diverging positively, indicating a change in the prevailing trend. Based on it, we can expect a pullback rally in the near term.  The strategy should be to buy 50 percent at current levels and the rest at Rs 1,350. For this, put a stop-loss at Rs 1,300. A pullback could extend further towards Rs 1,650 with a major resistance near Rs 1,550.    Jindal Steel &amp;amp; Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 520 | Stop-Loss: Rs 490 | Target: Rs 580 | Return: 11.5 percent  The stock has completed the first leg of the corrective pattern at Rs 500. It was a price and time-based correction for the stock. It was at Rs 620 and fell to Rs 500 in a span of four months, which is 50 percent of the time the rally displayed from Rs 300 level.

In a recent portfolio rejig, Wood has added Axis Bank with a 5 percent weighting and increased investment in Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro by one percentage point in the Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio.  To accommodate this, he has removed ICICI Lombard General Insurance and reduced the investments in HDFC Bank and Reliance by one percentage point each.    In the India long-only portfolio, Thermax and Axis Bank have been introduced with 5 percent and 6 percent weighting respectively. To make place, ICICI Lombard General Insurance and Maruti Suzuki India have been removed and the investment in HDFC Life has been reduced by one percentage point.  Finally, in the Global long-only equity portfolio, the investments in HDFC Life, BNP Paribas and Schlumberger have been removed and replaced by investments in Axis Bank, TSMC and BYD.    Wood's move comes on the heels of Axis Bank's merger with Citibank's India consumer business. In Q4, the private lender reported a net loss of Rs 5,728.42 crore on account of acquisition costs.  If we exclude this exceptional item, the profit for the quarter would have been Rs 6,625.29 crore, a 61 percent growth from Rs 4,117.77 crore in the same period last year.  The bank's net interest income jumped by 33.1 percent on-year to Rs 11,742.2 crore, while the net interest margin improved by 73 basis points to 4.22 percent.

axis,2023-05-15T09:26:34+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Top 10 trading ideas for next 3-4 weeks as Nifty may scale higher despite consolidation,"The momentum can take the Nifty50 towards 18,500-18,700 in coming sessions, if it sustains 18,200 mark which can be near term support, followed by 18,000 being crucial support, experts said","After a week of consolidation, the market flexed muscles and made more than a percent gains in the week ended May 12, with the Nifty50 forming a bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts after the formation of a shooting star kind of pattern in the previous week.  The index has also continued with higher tops formation for the seventh consecutive week and closed with 246 points gains at 18,315, the highest closing level since last December.  Even the momentum indicators RSI (relative strength index 14) showed bullish bias and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) giving a positive crossover above zero line on the weekly scale. Hence, the momentum can take the Nifty50 towards 18,500-18,700 in coming sessions, if it sustains 18,200 mark which can be near term support, followed by 18,000 being crucial support, experts said.  &quot;The sustenance of Nifty at the higher band of the consolidation zone for most of the trading sessions indicates inherent strength. As far as levels are concerned, 18,200 is likely to cushion any short-term blip, while the sacrosanct support lies around the 18,100-18,000 zone in the comparable period,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.  On the flip side, he feels 18,500 is very much in the vicinity and with ongoing momentum, it is strongly anticipated to get tested soon. At the same time, an authoritative breach beyond the same could trigger the next leg of rally in the upcoming weeks, he says.  Going ahead, he remains sanguine with the current momentum and would advocate the traders to utilize the dips to add long positions in the index.  Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio also feels the coming week is of extreme importance as it will decide the trend for the next leg. &quot;18,200 levels are expected to act as a strong support zone and if held in the forthcoming week, Nifty will start moving towards 18,500 levels.&quot;  &quot;Highest open interest is at 18,300 on the Call side and 18,200 on the Put side and hence, till the time Nifty is in this range, it is expected to remain sideways,&quot; Karwa said.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 12 closing prices:  Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities  Hubtown: Buy | LTP: Rs 45.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 40 | Target: Rs 55 | Return: 22 percent  Hubtown has shown relative strength last week. While the Nifty has gained 1.34 percent last week, Hubtown has gained a healthy 12.8 percent. In the process, the stock has closed above its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average). Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 44-46 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 40 and target of Rs 55.    LT Foods: Buy | LTP: Rs 113.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 108 | Target: Rs 126 | Return: 11 percent  After correcting from a high of Rs 122 tested in January 2023, Daawat found support around Rs 90 levels in March 2023. These are strong supports as they also roughly coincide with previous intermediate lows.  The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. Last week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and -day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 112-114 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 108 and target at Rs 126.    Grindwell Norton: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,990.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,900 | Target: Rs 2,150 | Return: 8 percent  Grindwell has bounced back from a low of Rs 1,725 touched in March 2023 where it made a 6-month low. The stock has since then gradually climbed higher and made a higher bottom in the process. The rise was accompanied with healthy volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which suggests potential for more upsides.  With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 1,980-2,020 levels, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,900 and target at Rs 2,150.  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 910.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 890 | Target: Rs 950-970 | Return: 6.5 percent  In the past week, the stock rallied over 5 percent and also formed long bullish candle. After a short term correction, the stock consistently forming higher bottom formation and comfortably trading above 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average) which is largely positive.  For the positional traders now, Rs 890 would be the important support level to watch out. If the stock manages to trade above the same then we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 950-970.    Bata India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1524.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 | Target: Rs 1,600-1,650 | Return: 8 percent  After a long correction eventually, the stock took the support near Rs 1,400 and reversed. Post reversal formation, it comfortably trading above 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average).  In addition, a promising reversal continuation formation on weekly charts and higher high higher low series on daily and intraday charts indicating further uptrend from the current levels.  Unless it trading below Rs 1,450, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 1,600-1,650. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 1,525 and Rs 1,490 levels with a stop-loss below Rs 1,450.    Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra: Buy | | LTP: Rs 1,275.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 | Target: Rs 1,315-1,335 | Return: 5 percent  On last Friday, the stock rallied nearly 2 percent and after a long time it succeeded to close above 200-day SMA level. Technically, on weekly charts it has formed bullish candle and on daily and intraday charts it is holding uptrend continuation formation.  We are of the view that, the short term texture of the stock is bullish and uptrend wave is likely to continue in the near future.  For the trend following traders now, Rs 1,240 or 10-day SMA would act as a sacrosanct support level. Above which, it could rally till Rs 1,315. Further upside may also continue which could lift the stock till Rs 1,335. On the flip side below Rs 1,240 uptrend would be vulnerable.

NIM declined by 10bps QoQ due to back-ended growth and higher LCR. However, NIM compression in FY24E could be lower for AXSB as (1) RIDF share declined YoY from 3.5% to 2.3% and (2) share of higher yielding products has increased. Ex-Citi, loan growth was strong at 7% QoQ, mainly led by retail/SME. Deposit outflow reduced by 550bps YoY and for Q4FY23 deposit accretion was healthy at 7% QoQ, due to CASA growth of 9.9%. Bank suggested that pace of branch expansion would increase and achieving a 2% opex to assets could take longer. Outlook Hence, we increase opex for FY24/25 by average 4% and lower PAT by 2.3%.

NIMs moderated marginally (-4bps QoQ) on account of excess liquidity on the balance sheet (LCR at 129%) and catch-up in funding costs following accelerated deposit mobilisation. That said, the loan-to-deposit ratio (~89%) continues to remain high and we believe AXSB will have to further accelerate efforts to match its targeted loan growth (management has guided for loan growth of 400-600bps above industry), which is likely to impede medium term NIMs.  Outlook We tweak our FY24/FY25E earnings estimates by +3% each to adjust for normalised credit costs and higher opex on continued investments in growth.

The Karvy demat scam, when it came under the public glare, raised thorny issues of regulatory failure and brought to the fore embarrassing shortfalls in SEBI's scope of supervision. One can gauge the gravity and critical attention accorded to this issue from the recent comment of SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch, who emphatically spelt out that another Karvy-like event will happen over the regulator's dead body.  Also read: SEBI’s Brightcom order: Many firsts in a complex area that needs many more orders for conclusive jurisprudence  In an order delivered by Whole Time Member SK Mohanty, the market regulator has directed Karvy Realty (India) Limited and Karvy Capital Limited, two subsidiaries of KSBL, that were beneficiaries of illegal transfers from their parent company to return an amount of Rs 1,442.95 crore within three months. If the two beneficiary companies fail in returning the transferred funds, NSE has been directed to take control of assets of the two companies, in order to recover the amount. The aforementioned funds were transferred out of KSBL between FY17 and FY20.  The market regulator has also penalised KSBL and its MD Comandur Parthasarathy to the tune of Rs 13 crore and Rs 8 crore respectively for violations of several SEBI circulars and regulations. It has also barred KSBL and Parthasarathy from accessing the securities and dealing in securities, in any manner, for a period of seven years.  Independent directors of the company, namely, Bhagwan Das Narang and Jyothi Prasad have also been penalised to pay an amount of Rs 5 lakh. Both of them have also been restrained from holding the post of director, or any key managerial position or associating themselves in any capacity with any listed public company and any public company for a period of two years.  Lastly, CEO Rajiv Ranjan Singh, who was found to have acted negligently and failed in exercising due diligence has been cautioned and has been directed &quot;to be careful before associating himself as a director or any key managerial position in any intermediary of the securities market or any listed public company&quot;.  The Karvy demat scam, which first came to light in the second half of 2019, was orchestrated by the brokerage house by pledging securities lying in the demat account of unsuspecting customers. The pledging, which happened behind the customer's back, was done to raise funds from banks and other NBFCs. Loans were raised from the likes of HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance and others.  In September 2016, KSBL’s outstanding borrowing under the loan against securities (LAS) facility offered by banks stood at Rs 789.41 crore, with the overall borrowing standing at Rs 1,051.36 crore. The said overall borrowing of KSBL increased to Rs 2,032.67 crore by September 30, 2019.  Simultaneously, there was a substantial increase in the pledging of securities by KSBL. The value of securities pledged increased from Rs 202 crore on June 30, 2017, to Rs 1,855 crore by March 2018 and had further increased to Rs 2,700 crore by September 2019.  The regulator also found out that as on September 05, 2019, at least 75 percent of the total shares in all its clients’ holdings were pledged by KSBL to borrow funds for its own use, which included cases where the clients’ holdings were pledged despite such clients having credit balances in their accounts maintained with KSBL.  &quot;The massive asset mobilization drive followed by raising of huge sums of funds from financial institutions by using the securities mobilized from the clients with a promise to pay them interest and misappropriating those funds...speak a tell-tale story of fraud driven by the greed of KSBL and its management to amass thousands of crore of rupees at the cost of its innocent clients, making it a fit case where SEBI needs to send out a firm message to deter the stock brokers and their managements from indulging in such acts of unethical, unfair and fraudulent behaviour as observed in this case,&quot; the WTM observed in its order.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-delivers-final-order-in-karvy-demat-scam-cracks-down-on-md-and-directors-10495611.html
axis,2023-04-28T10:16:39+05:30,Andy Mukherjee,"India’s banks have it all, except caution","Strong profit growth has put Indian financiers’ optimism in overdrive, but is it sustainable? Skimping on loss provisions is risky, especially when this strategy has backfired in the past","India’s banks spent most of the last decade out in the wilderness, as a punishment for the lax underwriting standards on their corporate loans. Now they have regained their health, restored profitability and reestablished investors’ trust. The benchmark Nifty Bank Index is close to an all-time high. With everything going well, the lenders should be turning cautious. But recent full-year results show an opposite trend: Provisions for future loan losses are beginning to decline. This may not be prudent.  Across most of Asia, muted big-ticket consumer expenditure — such as on housing — and restrained capital expenditure by firms have led to only a mild post-pandemic recovery in credit, which makes India’s double-digit loan growth a notable exception, according to economists at Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd Just last month, New Delhi-based developer DLF Ltd sold $1 billion worth of million-dollar homes on the outskirts of the national capital in 72 hours. A one-year, 29 percent jump in credit-card debt has made even the Reserve Bank of India, the regulator, a little uncomfortable. The central bank has cautioned lenders about the risk of delinquencies on their unsecured loans at meetings over at least the past three months, Reuters reported recently.  Yet, HDFC Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, two of the country's largest lenders by market value, slashed their loss provisions for the financial year that ended in March by 23 percent. The money ICICI has set aside cumulatively is now 9 billion rupees ($122 million) less than a year ago. That isn’t a problem yet, because gross nonperforming assets have declined at a faster pace of 27 billion rupees. However, there’s nothing to suggest that they won’t rise again.  With the incremental credit-to-deposit ratio running at 111 percent, Indian banks will have to pay more to savers — sacrificing some part of their high profitability. Although even this won’t affect all lenders equally. Higher deposit costs “will tip the scale in favor of our rated banks, allowing them larger bargaining power to price the loans and hence to defend their margins,” according to Rebecca Tan, a senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. Problems may erupt elsewhere. “The key risk we are watching really is the quality of these bank loans to small-and-medium-sized enterprises and that’s predominantly because of the current rising rate environment,” she said in a Bloomberg TV interview last month.  Since then, an unexpected pause in monetary tightening by the central bank has provided some reprieve, though the effects of a cumulative 250-basis-point increase in rates will be felt for some more time. High interest rates may be particularly worrisome for the risk-chasing behavior of nonbank financial institutions, or NBFIs, which don’t have access to low-cost deposits. “We believe more NBFIs are pursuing higher-yielding loans to offset greater pressure on funding costs and net interest margins,” Fitch Ratings said Thursday. Aggressive growth could “pressure lenders to take inordinate risks, which could weaken asset quality and credit profiles when the economic cycle turns,” it added.  Banks aren’t exactly oblivious to the danger. Excluding retail and rural lending, ICICI now has only 0.8 percent of its loan portfolio exposed to riskier firms rated BB or below. Two years ago, the figure was as high as 3.6 percent. Axis Bank Ltd, the fifth-largest lender, didn’t have to utilise its COVID-19-related loss cushion in the March quarter. As a result, even with a 64 percent drop in full-year provisions, it still has gross bad loans covered to the extent of 145 percent. However, all of this is backward looking. The retail loan book for both HDFC Bank and ICICI has grown by 1 trillion rupees apiece over the past 12 months. Axis saw almost a 900 billion rupee increase, while Bajaj Finance Ltd, a specialist nonbank lender to consumers and small firms, expanded its assets by about 500 billion rupees. Retail credit by just these four Indian lenders has expanded by almost the same amount in one year as the entire growth in the Thai banking system over the past four. And yet, Bajaj, too, has cut back on loss provisions by 34 percent.  Clearly, strong profit growth has put Indian financiers’ optimism in overdrive, but is it sustainable? The previous bout of unbridled enthusiasm for corporate lending ended with more than $200 billion in nonperforming assets, one of the world’s worst piles of bad loans. This time around, individuals’ data has replaced the collateral of plants and machines. Digital lending is the new mantra. The belief seems to be that any lender whose portfolio of unsecured retail loans is not increasing by 50 percent annually is simply not trying hard enough.  &amp;nbsp;  But consumer demand is being led by a small pocket of affluence. The 6.5 percent growth in gross domestic product that the government is penciling in for the fiscal year that began this month faces several risks. Turmoil in the US banking industry is making India’s $245 billion software-export industry gloomy. A sustained rise in oil prices, currently kept in check by  global growth concerns, would crimp already-limited purchasing power of urban low- and middle-income workers amid high unemployment. Meanwhile, climate change could dash any hope of a recovery in stagnant real wages in rural areas. Summer temperatures are above normal by about 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country. Heat waves could damage crops and cause power shortages.  It’s time lenders behaved a little more prudently. The aggregate bad-loan ratio of 4.41 percent at the end of last year was the lowest since March 2015. The system has “remained resilient and not been affected by the recent sparks of financial instability seen in some advanced economies,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a web-streamed address Thursday. Still, the central bank has “started looking at the business models of banks more closely,” he said. As it indeed should. For years, the stock market couldn’t expect even 1 percent return on assets from a vast swathe of the Indian banking industry. Now that things have changed, 2 percent should be good enough for current investors — with the rest of the profit kept aside to deal with future losses. Unusual as it is from a regional perspective, the credit upswing in India may not be at a risk of abrupt reversal. But since it’s a cycle, at some point it will turn.

The bank would be reporting a loss to mark down the goodwill on this acquisition. We expect a like-for-like loan growth to be similar to industry average at ~15% YoY. We are building NIM to be flat QoQ but the variables driving the actual NII performance would be challenging to forecast this quarter.”  “We expect slippages of ~Rs40 bn (~2% of loans) mostly led by small ticket loans. Expect strong commentary on asset quality performance and we see an improvement in NPL ratios aided by stronger recovery/upgradations. We should expect the bank to make higher provisions for expenses pertaining to the merger as well.

The platform will initially have only groceries, but will soon expand to other segments. ","Axis Bank, one of India’s largest private banks, is gearing up to launch a new consumer-facing buyers’ platform built on top of India’s Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) framework as it looks to strengthen its e-commerce forays amid a push from the government for deeper penetration of the open network, which is billed to be the UPI (unified payments interface) of digital commerce.  Axis has already designed the platform and will be launching it as a part of its e-commerce segment called Grab Deals, people aware of the matter told Moneycontrol. The platform will initially have only groceries, but will soon expand to other segments, the people said requesting anonymity. The platform will be going live soon and it will be launched in select cities initially, according to the people. Moneycontrol has seen internal documents of the new application.  “Grab Deals has been a part of Axis for some time now and as a part of this new project, the company is revamping the entire Grab Deals platform. While there’s no separate application for Grab Deals yet, Axis will be launching it soon,” said one of the people quoted above.  “The ONDC for groceries will still remain integrated even after Grab Deals goes live on app stores and going forward, the company might launch a separate app for the ONDC platform, too,” the person added.  Axis Bank’s move to launch a new buyers’ hyperlocal application on ONDC comes just a couple of weeks after Walmart-backed PhonePe, India’s most-valued fintech startup, launched a new application called Pincode with a focus on hyperlocal commerce. Axis Bank is also a shareholder in ONDC and holds roughly 8 percent stake.  Axis Bank did not comment on the story.  Besides PhonePe, fintech unicorn Paytm currently has an ONDC platform integrated into its main application. ONDC is an initiative of the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) under the Ministry of Commerce.  ONDC’s rollout started with limited pincodes in Bengaluru last September. So far, apart from Paytm and PhonePe, IDFC, Mystore, Craftsvilla and Spice Money are all buyer-side applications.  The platform takes no money from the government but is funded by banks including State Bank of India, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank, among others.  In March, ONDC expanded into mobility as well apart from food, grocery and e-commerce, as the network onboarded Namma Yatri onto the platform. While two cities are in ONDC’s beta stage, 181 are in the alpha stage.  Earlier this month, at a press conference in New Delhi, T Koshy, CEO of ONDC said the platform has been able to find 37 network participants. The platform is currently working with over 26,000 merchants, offering more than 27 lakh products on its network.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/axis-bank-follows-phonepe-develops-new-platform-for-groceries-on-ondc-10426091.html

axis,2023-04-03T06:22:09+05:30,Osho Krishan,"Hot Stocks | Here's why you should bet on TVS Motor, Axis Bank for short term","Axis Bank has seen a decisive spurt in the last two trading sessions, backed by notable volumes on the daily chart, signifying positive development in the counter.","Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Research at Angel One  The financial year 2022 bid adieu on a positive note as the benchmark index finally made headway to emerge from the slumber phase on the very last day of the year. Despite all the whipsaw moves throughout the week, the Nifty50 index concluded on a positive note, gaining nearly 2.50 percent from its previous close and settling a tad above the 17,350 level on March 31.  Technically speaking, the last two trading sessions construe positive developments and it is highly anticipated to continue the cheerful run in the upcoming financial year. The broad-based buying has levitated market sentiments and can be seen as a sign of progression as we emerged from the slumber phase.  As far as levels are concerned, the bullish gap of the 17,200-17,130 odd zone is expected to cushion any short-term blip, with the sacrosanct support placed around the psychological mark of 17,000 for the time being. While on the higher end, a decisive move beyond the bearish gap of 17,450-17,580 would affirm the trend reversal in the market.  Going forward, we remain sanguine with the current momentum and would advocate the traders to utilize the dips to add long positions in the index in the comparable period.  Here are two buy calls with short-term view:  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 858.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 828 | Target: Rs 892-900 | Return: 5 percent  Axis Bank has seen a decisive spurt in the last two trading sessions, backed by notable volumes on the daily chart, signifying positive development in the counter.  On a technical aspect, the stock is on the verge of a ‘double bottom’ breakout, which is being supported by a positive crossover on the 14-day RSI, adding to the bullish quotient.  Hence, we recommend to buy Axis Bank in the range of Rs 855-858, for a target of Rs 892-900.    TVS Motor Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,077.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030 | Target: Rs 1,120-1,130 | Return: 5 percent  TVS Motor is in a secular uptrend and hovers well above all its EMAs (exponential moving averages) on the daily chart. The stock has recently seen some buying traction and emerged above the sloping trendline on the daily time frame, adding to a bullish quotient.  The primary indicators align with the trend suggesting a continuation in the movement in a comparable period. Hence, we recommend to buy TVS Motor Company with a target of Rs 1,120-1,130.

A veteran who spent over two decades at Credit Suisse, Mishra is considered one of the foremost experts on the global economy.  According to a Bloomberg report, the Indian Institute of Technology graduate recently resigned as co-head of Asia Pacific strategy and head of securities research at Credit Suisse Group AG and is set to lead Axis Bank’s research department.  Why did Mishra quit Credit Suisse? Mishra declined to comment. However, there is speculation that Mishra’s exit from the second-largest lender in Switzerland is part of a large-scale talent exodus from the bank on account of organisational problems.  For Axis, this is part of chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry’s plans to bolster businesses including the wealth management and investment banking business of the lender, according to Bloomberg. Experts said Mishra’s entry could benefit Axis in the long run.  Axis hiring  “Mishra’s strength of the organisation that he's worked for 20-plus years is really positive. And it will add to the capabilities of Axis companies, whether he joins the bank, whether he joins the mutual fund, or Axis Securities. So, it will add actually strength to the existing team,” a former banker said on condition of anonymity.  Zurich-based Credit Suisse lost many senior employees as a result of recent scandals, leadership changes, and legal issues. Axis Mutual Fund hired Ashish Gupta as its chief investment officer earlier this month, according to an exchange filing. Gupta was previously Credit Suisse's head of India equity research. Gupta left Credit Suisse in November, after about 14 years.  “Chaudhry, in the last three and half years, has been hiring some of the best talent across the board,” a former banker said, adding that now Axis is one of the top banks by credit quality, credit growth or any other business metric.  UBS Group AG, Switzerland's largest banking group, agreed to acquire the crisis-hit Credit Suisse Group AG in a historic, government-brokered deal. UBS will pay 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) for 167-year-old Credit Suisse and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses, Reuters reported.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Chaudhry also said valuation for Axis Bank’s acquisition of Citi remained competitive and that the price paid “is around the market valuations”.  “Citibank had a 150-year-old franchise, and the valuations remain very competitive. The deal is well priced if you look at the similarly rated companies in the marketplace. We don’t need any capital to pay for this deal. This will be funded entirely from the existing balance sheet,” he added.  Chaudhary’s comments come after the Mumbai-headquartered bank completed the acquisition of Citigroup’s India consumer business for Rs 11,603 crore on March 1, 2023.  The private lender gained Citibank’s 30 lakh unique customers, seven offices, 21 branches and 499 ATMs in 18 cities across the country.  Citigroup has exited retail operations in 13 markets, including India.  Also Read | MC Explains: Axis Bank completes acquisition of Citibank's consumer business. Here’s what it means  Huge Opportunity  Chaudhry sees the Citi acquisition as a “huge opportunity to leverage synergy benefits” and take Axis Bank products to Citi customers and “bring some of Citi’s best practices to Axis customers”.  “We will improve the overall current account savings account (CASA) ratio of the entity; 60 various initiatives has been identified which will improve the quality of the overall franchise. Average deposit per account will improve by 13 percent,” he said.  The combination of the two would add a huge amount of value. There were also various cost benefits from the acquisition of Citibank's retail assets in India. The integration of these assets with Axis Bank would bring significant value to the business, he added.  One such advantage, he said, was that 97 percent of Citi employees joined Axis Bank. “This will ensure a smooth transition and help in retaining the talent pool of Citibank,” Chaudhary said.  Stock Movement  At 12.19 pm Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 858.10 on the BSE, down Rs 1.35, or 0.16 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 860.80 and an intraday low of Rs 853.10.

This is estimated to result in an accounting loss of Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 6,000 crore due to various one-time expenses such as goodwill formation and provisioning policies, as per the report.  &quot;The cash purchase consideration will result in the formation of goodwill which Axis Bank will be writing off entirely in Q4,&quot; Suresh Ganapathy, associate director at Macquarie Capital, told ET.

The expensing of acquisition cost (including goodwill) would hurt the 4QFY23 P/L as also the networth (NW) of Axis Bank, but should provide a boost to the bank’s retail assets growth and also be RoE accretive, given the higher leverage. Key takeaways from the call and our view: The overall acquired deposits base has meaningfully reduced by 21% to Rs399bn (77% being CASA) as at end Feb-23 from Rs502bn in Mar-22, mainly due to Citi customers choosing not to port to Axis Bank. Management believes that this could be due to some customers consolidating their banking relationship, while some have moved to other banks. We believe this could be partly owing to some corporate customers, including MNCs, moving their banking relationship (including employee salary accounts). In our view, the interest outgo on Citi’s retained savings-customers would go up, as Axis’s SA rate is higher at 3-3.5% vs Citi’s 2.5%.  Outlook We believe the higher deposit run-down, coupled with optically higher loss in 4Q, could weigh on the stock performance. However, we remain long-term positive on the stock, given its improving retail orientation/core profitability, healthy provisioning buffer and reasonable valuations. We retain BUY, with revised TP of Rs1,250/share (based on 2x Dec-24E un-merged standalone bank ABV or 2.1x Dec-24E proforma merged standalone bank ABV + subsidiaries’ value at Rs80 per share).

The deal includes the credit card, wealth and retail banking operations of both Citibank India and Citicorp Finance. It has acquired loans/deposits worth INR273b/INR399b, including the credit card book of INR86b. AXSB’s credit card book has increased by 42% to INR292b. Wealth management AUM has risen ~33% to INR3.8t, making it the third largest player by combined AUM. AXSB has added ~2.4m unique customers, complemented by Citibank's affluent customer segment, and gained access to 21 branches and 459 ATMs. It has retained 3,200 Citibank employees. While the overall synergies in terms of cost savings will start to accrue from CY24, the bank will take a one-time hit in its 4QFY23 P&amp;amp;L related to 1) charge-off of Goodwill and other intangibles, 2) policy harmonization cost, and 3) implementation expenses. Thus, the CET I ratio is likely to moderate by ~177bp to ~13.8%.

It gets ready access to highly affluent wealth customers of Citi for Burgundy Private Banking.,"Axis Bank has completed the acquisition of Citibank’s consumer business in an accelerated time frame of within seven months after receipt of approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The deal has been closed with Axis Bank paying a total purchase consideration of Rs 11,603 crore to Citibank India. Axis Bank welcomes the 30 lakh plus customers of Citibank.  Let’s decode what Axis Bank and Citibank customers gained from this deal.  What was the transaction all about?  The transaction comprises the sale of the consumer businesses of Citibank India, which includes loans, credit cards, wealth management and retail banking operations to Axis Bank. The deal also includes the sale of the consumer business of Citi’s non-banking financial company, Citicorp Finance (India) Limited, comprising asset-backed financing business, which includes commercial vehicle and construction equipment loans, as well as the personal loans portfolio.  “The bank has gained access to the large, affluent and profitable customer franchise of Citibank, which aligns well with its premiumisation strategy,” says Amitabh Chaudhry, MD &amp;amp; CEO, Axis Bank. He adds, the premium portfolio and business synergies through this deal will help accelerate and add further momentum to the bank’s already robust plans across priority segments.  Axis Bank improves market share in the cards business  Axis Bank’s position in the cards business improved from 11.4 percent to 16.2 percent. It bagged a quality credit card franchise with one of the highest wallet shares in premium cards.  After this acquisition, Axis Bank expects a healthy accretion to the existing card base. Axis Bank sees 19 percent growth in outstanding cards. Combining both the entities, the outstanding cards are 1.12 crore, as per RBI data for April 2022 to January 2023. The combined annual spending per card is set to increase by around 10 percent.  “With the highest number of transactions per card across the industry and digitally engaged customers, the deal would strengthen Axis Bank’s position in the top eight metros,” says Chaudhry. He adds, it also provides the opportunity to adopt global best practices in client servicing and operations through Citi Phone banking.

Citi customers will continue to avail all the rewards, privileges and offers on the cards.  The Citi branding and logo will continue on the existing cards. Those will phase out during the transition period in the next 12 to 18 months.  “The credit card portfolio of Axis Bank varies from Citi, so there is no overlapping of features and benefits. Considering this, we don’t have any plans to merge or discontinue any existing credit cards,” says Arjun Chowdhry, Group Executive &amp;amp; Head of Cards, Payments &amp;amp; Wealth, Axis Bank.  Citi customers will continue to be serviced by the same relationship managers and teams for investments and insurance.

Here’s what it means for...,Axis Bank’s acquisition of Citibank’s consumer business is likely to lead to changes in the Indian bank’s retail portfolio ,"On March 1, Axis Bank completed the acquisition of Citibank’s consumer business. The deal, which was announced in March 2022, will see India’s third-largest private sector bank absorbing Citibank’s consumer businesses, covering loans, credit cards, wealth management and retail banking operations in India.  The deal happened after Citigroup in 2021 announced its decision to shutter its retail banking operations in 13 countries, including India, as part of a global business strategy. Axis Bank put out a video advertisement to welcome Citibank’s 30 lakh plus customers on March 1.  Here is an explainer on what the deal means for customers and employees:  What was the deal?  In March 2022, it was announced by the two banks that Axis Bank would acquire the consumer banking business of Citibank. The deal would include the sale of covering loans, credit cards, wealth management and retail banking operations in India.    In addition, the deal will also include the sale of the consumer business of Citi's non-banking financial company, Citicorp Finance (India) Limited, comprising the asset-backed financing business, which includes commercial vehicle and construction equipment loans, as well as the personal loans portfolio.  How much will Axis Bank pay Citibank?  Axis Bank announced that it would pay a consideration of up to Rs 12,325 crore to Citibank for the acquisition.  Why did Citi sell its consumer business?  It was part of a global strategy. In 2021, Citigroup, the parent company of Citibank, had announced a decision to close its retail banking operations in 13 countries, including India, to re-align its global business strategy. The other markets are Australia, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.  What does the deal mean for Citibank employees?  Axis Bank had said that it would onboard more than 3,500 employees of Citibank after the acquisition of its consumer businesses in India.  “Employees joining Axis Bank will be receiving their current or a better remuneration package,” Axis Bank MD and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said during the announcement of the deal.  What does the deal mean for customers of Citibank?  The sentiment among Citibank customers has been mixed, in general. Some customers have praised Citibank for its services and welcomed the deal, while others have expressed concern about what the future will hold in terms of existing services.  “Citibank India, I’ve been your customer for nearly 25 years now. You’ve been brilliant and close to perfect all these years,” said Nagesh Kamath, a Citibank customer.  Adios @Citi! The best banking experience I had in the last 12 years.

In the three-tier structure of the Indian MF industry (sponsor, trustee and AMC), the Board of Trustees, or Trustee Company, holds the property of a mutual fund in trust for the benefit of unitholders.  While MF regulations provide guidelines to address conflicts of interest, there may still remain some areas that require trustees to pay specific attention to.  Potential conflicts may be investments by MF schemes in public issues of the sponsor or associates, sponsor group companies engaging in insider trading or front running by taking advantage of access to MF schemes, as well as sponsors influencing voting by MF schemes.   Also read | Check out Moneycontrol’s curated list of 30 investment-worthy mutual fund schemes  “An AMC is a profit-making entity. SEBI wants to ensure that there are checks and balances on them. The regulator is always worried about mutual funds because these are the most retail of all the products. The level of regulations has always been the highest amongst all the asset classes,” said Sandeep Parekh, Managing Partner at Finsec Law Advisors.  Here are the key proposals made by the capital market regulator.  SEBI assigns KRAs to trustees  Over a period of time, the regulator has cast various responsibilities over the trustees to ensure that AMCs act in a manner that is not skewed in favour of AMC stakeholders.  In its latest proposal, SEBI wants trustees to be given more power to focus on certain “core responsibilities.”  These include ensuring the fairness of fees and expenses charged by the AMC and monitoring the performance of the schemes against peers/ benchmarks.  Trustees are also expected to investigate alleged misconduct, including market abuse/misuse of information by the AMC and undue influence by sponsors or associates.   Also read | Sebi may force large mutual fund houses to lower fees  Presently, the trustees primarily rely on the AMCs for ensuring compliance with regulations and to confirm compliance in periodic reporting to SEBI.  SEBI is of the opinion that it is crucial that the trustees independently evaluate the extent of compliance by AMCs and not merely rely on submissions /external assurances made by them.  Trustees may also be tasked to examine instances of mis-selling by AMCs to boost Assets Under Management (AUM) and their valuation.  “To ensure that trustees devote time and attention to their core responsibilities, it is felt that for fulfilling other responsibilities, trustees may rely on professional firms such as audit, legal, merchant bankers. etc, for carrying out due diligence on behalf of the trustees,” SEBI said in the paper.  Apart from these suggestions, SEBI also plans to increase the minimum number of trustees from the currently prescribed four.  Indemnity provisions  According to SEBI, upon a review of the existing indemnity provisions concerning trustees in MF regulations, and on comparison with other regulations in the Trust Act and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), etc., it was observed that while some of the provisions in these legislation make trustees liable for negligence, MF regulations state that trustees shall not be held liable for acts done in good faith if they have exercised adequate due diligence.  Also read | 5 points to know about expense ratios of mutual fund schemes  The regulator is now proposing that while trustees are responsible for the acts collectively undertaken as part of the board of the company in question, they should not be made liable for the acts committed individually by co-trustees that are beyond the powers delegated to them.  Whose job is it, anyway?  The capital market regulator is looking to clearly spell out the role, responsibility and accountability of the board of an AMC in the regulations, circular or guidelines for the mutual fund industry.  To this end, SEBI is proposing to streamline the responsibilities to ensure that trustees can devote attention to their fiducial obligations rather than being burdened with operational responsibilities.  Also read | Sebi launches information database on municipal bonds  For example, under various sections on obligations, SEBI has suggested that the word “mutual fund” should be replaced by “AMC”.  The current obligations of the ‘mutual fund’ such as computation of the valuation of investment or net asset value, declaring dividends, disclosure of AUM and many others are proposed to clearly become the responsibility of the ‘AMC’.  In investor interest  To have an independent review mechanism for the decisions of an AMC from the perspective of the unitholders’ interest, SEBI has proposed that a Unitholder Protection Committee (UPC) may be constituted by the board of AMC.  The UPC is expected to protect the interests of unitholders of mutual fund schemes, redressal of their grievances, investor education and awareness.  Further, this committee is proposed to comprise at least three directors as members, wherein at least two-thirds of the members should be independent directors of the AMC.  Additionally, to ensure ease of access, SEBI has mooted a common platform for the dissemination of public announcements by all mutual funds on the lines of regulatory disclosures by companies on Indian stock exchanges.  Also read | Sponsor-less AMCs possible in India? SEBI thinks yes; calls for opinions  “Finance news and information is available on every platform possible currently. Right from your newspaper to social media. But a retail consumer is lost amidst all such news and facts because of which they are unaware of what is true and what is not,” said Manish Maryada, Chief Executive Officer, and Co-founder, Fello, a game-based savings app.  The common platform can host all public announcements such as notices and addenda issued across all mutual funds.  This significantly reduces the work of investors, who would have to take the trouble of navigating fund houses’ websites to search for such addenda.  Triggers for review  Over the past decade, there has been a fivefold increase in the size of the mutual fund industry. The industry’s AUM grew from Rs 7.93 trillion on November 30, 2012 to Rs 10 trillion in May 2014, and in the next span of about three years it crossed Rs 20 trillion in August 2017.  The size of the industry’s AUM crossed Rs 30 trillion in November 2020 and, recently in November 2022, it surged past the Rs 40 trillion mark.  Industry insiders believe that the heightened scrutiny may be a fallout of alleged misconduct at some of the industry’s top fund mutual fund houses.  “This is due to whatever has happened in the industry in the last two-three years. The SEBI has intervened to tell the trustees that this is their job. Mutual fund is a business of trust, and the business belongs to trustees. We have a fiduciary responsibility, as it is somebody else's money that we are managing,” said the head of a fund house, requesting anonymity.  In 2022, Axis mutual fund came under regulatory scanner after alleged instances of misconduct. After the fund house submitted an internal investigation report, SEBI is now said to be finalising an order on the matter.  In 2020, Franklin Templeton MF wound up six of its debt schemes after Covid-19-led debt market illiquidity came about. A forensic audit later pointed out that the firm invested heavily in unlisted debt securities, which were mainly illiquid. After SEBI penalised the fund house and its officials and trustees, Franklin Templeton MF appealed in the Securities and Appellate Tribunal where the matter is currently being heard.  SEBI has invited comments on the proposals put forward in the Consultation Paper on Review of Role and Obligations of Mutual Fund Trustees until February 24, 2023.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/sebi-mutual-fund-trustees-10123441.html

This, coupled with reversal of MTM losses, led to a 9% beat on PAT at Rs58.5bn (up 62% YoY). Overall LLP was higher than expected, as the bank made prudent provision of Rs3.4bn on a specific account, showing early signs of weakness. Overall Credit growth was moderate at 15% YoY/4% QoQ vs peers’ (&amp;gt;20% YoY), mainly due to sluggish growth in the retail book at 17% YoY/1% QoQ, in turn dragged by mortgage and card book. However, NIM expanded 30bps QoQ to 4.3%, due to better portfolio mix, asset re-pricing and interest recognition in a restructured account. Bank expects NIM to remain structurally healthy, as the full benefit of portfolio mix and RIDF run-down is yet to reflect. As per Management, the Citi retail portfolio acquisition deal is well on track and should be consummated within the guided timeline. Bank’s internal RoE generation remains stronger than consumption (due to moderate growth), with CET 1 at 15.6%; thus, it may not need to raise capital in the near term. Outlook We revise our earnings estimate upward for FY23/FY24/FY25 by 7%/4%/2%, and expect the bank to deliver 1.7-1.8%/17% RoA/RoE by FY25E. Given the improving coreprofitability, RoE profile and Management stability, we revise our TP multiple to 2.1x Dec24E ABV (from 1.8x) and, thus, our TP to Rs1,300/share (vs Rs1,110 earlier); retain BUY.

Gross non-performing assets fell to 2.38 percent of the loan book from 3.17 percent a year ago.  The gross bad loan pile stood at Rs 19,961 crore as of December, a year-on-year decline of 14 percent. Fresh slippages too declined year-on-year to Rs 3807 crore from Rs 4147 crore in the December quarter of the previous year.  However, fresh slippages showed a marginal increase sequentially. While stress may have reduced, the bank has not had enough luck with getting its money back from defaulters during the quarter. Recoveries and upgrades were lower at Rs 2,088 crore.  The bank’s provisions rose for the quarter to Rs 1,341 crore, almost double that of the previous quarter. Despite this, the net profit growth was a sharp 62 percent owing to operating profit growth of a healthy 51 percent.  The bank’s operating profit was Rs 9,277 crore, helped by a modest 8 percent growth in operating expenses against a 32 percent increase in NII and a 23 percent rise in fee income.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-banks-q3-net-profit-surges-62-to-rs-5853-crore-beats-estimates-9919541.html

The average of the estimates of seven brokerages polled by Moneycontrol forecasts the net profit for the December quarter at Rs 5,321.5 crore, up 70 percent from Rs 3,130 crore a year ago. Net interest income (NII), the core income a bank earns through lending, is expected to grow 25 percent to Rs 10,846 crore, the poll showed. In the December quarter last year, the private sector lender had reported an NII of Rs 8,650 crore.  Analysts expect the NII growth to come on the back of a robust loan book expansion, putting loan growth at 15-16 percent. Axis Bank’s loan growth has averaged 14-18 percent for the past four quarters, a trend that is likely to continue. “Market share gain in SME, Bharat banking, leadership growth in cards, strengthening of transaction banking and growth in identified focused retail segments, will be the key growth drivers,” wrote analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd in their note. The bank’s focus on rural and semi-urban centres also augurs well for balance sheet growth, according to analysts.  On deposits, the bank is expected to report a modest growth of 10-11 percent, in line with larger peer banks such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank that have reported earnings so far. The movement within term and low-cost current and savings account deposits would be keenly watched. Notwithstanding rate hikes, analysts see the lender reporting an expansion in its net interest margin (NIM). “We see NIM to expand further, given frontloaded benefits of rate transmission; we expect front-ended NIM expansion for the bank,” wrote those at Elara Capital in a note.  All these should help boost net interest income along with an expected reduction in credit costs owing to improved asset quality.  Asset quality signs  Axis Bank is expected to continue with its asset quality improvement and report a reduction in bad loan ratios. In the September quarter, the bank had reported a gross bad loan ratio of 2.50 percent. Therefore, provisions may reduce leading to a boost to the bottomline. That said, small loans and lending to agriculture may show some signs of pain, according to analysts. Kotak Institutional Equities estimates that fresh slippages may come in at Rs 3,500 crore for the quarter. In the September quarter, the bank had reported slippages worth Rs 3,383 crore.  Overall provisioning needs would be low given low fresh stress and high provisioning coverage ratio of 80 precent.  Investors would keenly watch for the progress of Citibank’s credit card business acquisition by Axis Bank. Further, commentary from the management on margins in the coming quarters amid rising deposit rates would also be watched for. “A protracted high interest-rate cycle is a greater risk to Axis Bank than to large private peers, in terms of potential market share loss in prime credit,” point out analysts at BNP Paribas in a note.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-bank-q3-preview-net-profit-seen-70-up-on-low-provisions-strong-nii-9914261.html

Both public and private banks have been on a partnership spree in recent months to bring more customers on board. Lenders have also introduced offers by way of new debit and credit cards, digital banking services, and lending rates.  State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, has tied up with about 20 companies over the past five months to offer services ranging from digital banking and financial payment options to credit facilities. The lender recently partnered with Warehouse Development Regulatory Authority to provide low-interest rate loans to farmers. SBI also partnered with motorcycle company Jawa Yezdi to provide financial options to its customers.  Canara Bank, another public sector lender, has joined with National E-Governance Service Ltd. to expand its digital banking services. The lender will offer a digital workflow of bank guarantees that will eliminate physical insurance, stamping, verification, and paper-based record maintenance.  Among private sector lenders, Axis Bank has tied up with OPEN, a digital banking enterprise, to provide digital current account services for its various customer segments.  DBS Bank India recently partnered with Gofrugal Technologies, a platform offering ERP solutions to adopt Open Network for Digital Commerce for its enterprise customers.  Laura Spiekerman, president of Alloy, a fintech and banking facilitator, said in a report that such partnerships help banks adopt new technologies and infrastructure to provide their services.  “Partnerships with fintech companies help banks provide new features to eager customers without spending costly resources to build their own digital products, while still earning a share of the profits,” Spiekerman said.  International partnerships  Some private banks have partnered with international companies and airlines to expand their products and services.  HDFC Bank, the largest private sector lender, partnered with Microsoft for cloud services for its banking operations.  Yes Bank and Mastercard have got together to introduce a debit card for its ultra-high net worth individual customers.  IndusInd bank tied up with Qatar Airways and British Airways to introduce a multi-branded credit card.  Partnerships here to stay?  Banks have traditionally partnered with companies for reasons including reaching a wider customer network and availing advanced technological services.  As banks recover from the tumultuous times of the pandemic, experts said partnerships will be their focus for some time in the near future.  “Customers would prefer using different banking services. And not only that, but banks are looking for more tie-ups with companies. We feel that these partnerships will stay for some time,” said Vijay Singh Gour, a senior analyst at Care Ratings.  Any risks with partnerships?  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been strict on regulations concerning fintech firms and companies that are native to the digital ecosystem. Experts are of the opinion that barring partnerships with fintech and other digital lenders, on which RBI has kept a close watch, there is no risk involved in such partnerships.  Gour said there are some risks which the banks and the RBI are working on.  “The regulator has been working in a collaborative manner to mitigate the risks associated with fintechs and digital lenders,” Gour said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks-go-big-on-partnerships-to-expand-services-lure-customers-9889281.html

We will not make the same mistakes again,&quot; said Amitabh Chaudhry while speaking exclusively to Moneycontrol on the sidelines of Davos 2023.  The Axis Bank CEO said corporate borrowers, too, have realised they cannot take the banks for a ride. The large-scale loan write-offs have helped banks to clean up their books, enabling fresh lending, said Chaudhry.  &quot;All the write-offs that have been done have put the banking system on a sound footing. The balance sheets are well capitalised. They are clean. The Indian banking system is ready to lend to the right set of people,&quot; said Chaudhry.  Also Read: Davos 2023 | Major issues on World Economic Forum's agenda over the years  &quot;I think even the entrepreneurs have learned a lesson that they cannot take the banking system for a ride. And If you do, there are consequences to it. In that sense, the system is well-prepared,&quot; said the chief of India's third-largest private sector bank.  Chaudhry's comments are significant in the wake of around Rs 10 lakh crore of corporate loan write-offs by Indian banks in the last five years. This helped banks to lower their bad loans significantly.  As per the data disclosed in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) asset quality report, the gross non-performing assets (GPAs) of Indian lenders have declined to a seven-year low of 5 percent in September 2022.  The net non-performing assets (NNPA) dropped to a 10-year low of 1.3 percent in September. On the face of it, this is good news. A lower share of NPAs reflects positively on bank balance sheets.  Chaudhry highlighted that the bankers are now cautious about working towards maintaining their asset quality. &quot;We also have to be cognizant of the fact that we cannot go back to the old days. If you make mistakes today, you will pay 3-5 years down the line for that mistake,&quot; Chaudhry said.  &quot;So as bankers, it is critical to ask this question are we creating risks today which could lead to NPLs tomorrow,&quot; Chaudhry said.  Rate hike cycle coming to an end  Also Read: Davos 2023 | Budget should drive growth, help generate more jobs, says Niti Aayog CEO Parameswaran Iyer  Chaudhry said that the RBI's interest rate hike cycle is likely coming to an end and the central bank's rate actions have helped to keep the inflation under control.  &quot;We are expecting another rate hike may be 25 bps in February. We believe that should be the end of the interest rate hike cycle. But, these are ultimately speculations. The MPC (monetary policy committee) has done a great job,&quot; said Chaudhry.  Speaking on deposit rate hikes by banks, Chaudhry said that banks may work on hiking deposit rates as credit growth is ahead of deposit growth. &quot;That ultimately needs to be settled down. So because banks want to grow, deposit rates might continue to rise,&quot; Chaudhry said.  India a bright spot  The Axis Bank CEO said India is seen as a bright spot in the global economic landscape but the execution is key to getting more foreign investments.  &quot;India is clearly a bright spot. The government and RBI have managed covid crisis extremely well. The government has created a lot of strategic partnerships.

Neeraj Gambhir, group executive of treasury and markets at Axis Bank, believes that an unchanged market borrowing target for FY24 would be good news for the bond market. “So as long as the budget’s glide path is maintained on fiscal consolidation and the government borrowing size is not very different from what they have done this year, I think the market will be kind of okay,” Gambhir said in an interview with Moneycontrol.  Follow Moneycontrol's live stock market updates here  Gambhir believes there are enough levers for bank credit growth to remain robust but companies could relook at corporate bonds for fund-raising as bank loans begin to look expensive with rates hikes. That would result in widening of spreads in the coming months.  Edited excerpts.  Last year was not a great one in terms of corporate bond issuances. What was behind the modest issuance volume?  In May we had a surprise rate hike and subsequently we had a series of rate hikes. So obviously, a very sharp repricing happened in the market and when you have such a sharp repricing and such a sharp increase of interest rates, it takes issuers a bit of a time to get used to the new levels. And that's what we saw happen.  From the investor side, the appetite was also muted, because we saw the overall liquidity in the system come down. Mutual funds saw outflows from their schemes in the initial phase of the rate hiking cycle and that too impacted demand. What has helped is that in the second half of the calendar year, particularly after October, we have seen very strong demand from long-term investors, like pension funds, EPF, insurance etc. All these segments have actually come back very strongly at the longer end of the curve. This explains why, in the last 2-3 months, we saw a good amount of supply of long-term bonds and this supply got sort of very quickly absorbed as well.  We saw some instances of pricing where private sector AAA bonds were priced at par with G-secs or even a couple of times below G-secs, in the 10-year segment? Have these anomalies corrected and why did this happen in the first place?  It was a short phase of time when we saw these happen. Investors have mandates and as end of the year nears, they must fulfil their mandates. If the supply is limited at that point in time, you can see sometimes these kinds of phenomena happen. But in general, what we are seeing is that the credit spreads are extremely tight right now, particularly for PSU issuers. Even if I look at private sector issuers, the credit spreads are on the tighter side of the range, historically speaking. It is effectively telling you that there is demand from these long-term investments, and there is not enough supply and this is why the spreads continue to be quite tight.  Would we see companies come back to the bond market this year?  The dynamics of pricing corporate loans in India is that they are largely linked to MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds Based Landing Rate) which changes when the deposit rates in the system change. So while the corporate bond market, as we discussed earlier, has gone ahead and priced in the future rate hikes in the earlier part of the year, the pricing adjustment of corporate loans has been a slow affair. Therefore, till now, it made more sense for corporates to tap into their bank lines, rather than go for bonds as the bond market pricing was higher than loan pricing. I expect that going forward this pricing gap between the loan market and the bond market will narrow. Therefore, we may see that some of the corporates which had switched to the loans may start coming back the bond market.  Another factor that isn't getting talked about much is the fact that borrowing in dollars and swapping into INR has become very expensive. Therefore, it still makes sense for a company to say for example, do a rupee bond and not do a dollar bond. To that extent, I think the corporates are looking at the domestic market, whether it is the loan market or bond market, for financing. And that is one possible reason why you're seeing strong credit growth in this year. This trend is also likely to continue for some time.  What is your outlook on government bond yields?  I'm expecting G-sec yields to consolidate now. I don't think that we want to see a big move up in yields from here onwards. Obviously, a lot depends upon what the government does in the budget. So as long as the budget’s glide path is maintained on fiscal consolidation and the government borrowing size is not very different from what they have done this year, I think the market will be fine. Therefore, I don't expect the G-sec yields to actually go significantly either way. I think for now reaching 7.50% on the 10-year benchmark looks difficult.  What have the markets priced in terms of rate hikes? What is your expectation?  If you look at the OIS (Overnight Index Swap) curve, it is basically pricing in another 25 bps (basis points). A 25 bps rate hike is a given in February and there is some probability of another 25 bps also. This is what the curve is telling us now. The G-sec curve is obviously a little bit higher because it is impacted by the fact that liquidity in the system is coming down. So, while the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) rate hikes maybe 25 or 50 bps, the key question is whether the operational rate will be SDF (Standing Deposit Facility) or MSF (Marginal Standing Facility). This depends upon the liquidity in the system. This is what the bond market is looking at.  My expectation is that 25 or maybe 50 bps maximum in terms of rate hikes.  Do you see any possibility of consolidation at the short-end or you think this steep movement will be maintained?  I think the short end could see a little bit more pressure from now until March because we have seen a significant amount of issuance activity in the calendar year from the banking system. The outstanding CDs (Certificates of Deposit) by the banks have actually gone up quite sharply over the last 12 to 18 months. Effectively, as the credit demand has accelerated, the deposit growth has lagged. Banks have also relied more and more on CD market to fund the growth. And that is getting reflected in the spreads in the money market. The spread of one-year CD over one year T-bill is almost 100 basis points. The spreads are elevated at the shorter end of the money market and that is likely to continue very to this year as we go into financial year-end.  Foreign Institutional Investors have been largely absent or exits have happened from the bond market. Should we not expect flows at all now?  There is some uncertainty about when the US rate hiking cycle will stop. If we go by the rate probabilities in the market reflected in the yield curves, the market is expecting another 100 basis points of rate hike with a terminal Fed funds rate somewhere close to 5 percent and thereafter, a period of consolidation.  But the speeches coming out of Fed seem to suggest that there is at least one subsection of the Fed, which wants to keep the rates higher, for a much longer period. Much of that clarity will emerge in the next three to four months when we get to see the data on inflation. My expectation is that while we are looking at 100 basis point kind of rate hike by the Fed, I think it's very difficult for money to move into emerging market assets. Think about this, cash used to earn zero in the US, now it earns 4 percent and soon it could become 5 percent. Until that clarity on US rates emerges, I don't see a big flows coming into the emerging markets. Bond flows will only start when we see a resolution on when the Fed rate hiking cycle stops and when the market starts expecting rate cuts.  The government has announced sovereign green bond issuance. What kind of demand and pricing are you expecting?  The issue in India is currently we don't have any green funds. We're not very clear how much of these bonds will attract global interest because they are local currency and not foreign currency. I think there is a bit of a price discovery that should happen here. There is no stopping the domestic investors to otherwise buy these bonds. Demand will always be there. The question is whether the green label is going to give a pricing edge. But that remains to be seen, because we don't have dedicated green funds. For now the pool of investors is the same as G-sec.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-interview-budget-key-for-10-year-yield-corporate-bond-sales-may-increase-says-axis-banks-gambhir-9839521.html

Loan growth is witnessing a healthy recovery with 14-18% growth over the past four quarters (vs 13% CAGR over FY19-22), driven by retail loans (18% CAGR). Small business banking (SBB)/rural loans posted a robust CAGR of 49%/23%. The rural and semi-urban market remains a key focus area, which should enable sustainable loan growth over the medium term. We, thus, expect a 17% CAGR in loans over FY22-25. AXSB has multiple levers in place to offset the rise in the funding cost as 68% of loans are floating, which, coupled with the rising mix of high-yielding loans and a gradual reduction in low-yielding RIDF bonds (3% of assets), should help margins. AXSB remains focused on building a stronger, consistent, and sustainable franchise. Since asset quality issues are behind, slippages and credit cost will be under control. While the bank will continue to make investments, it expects to bring down the costto-assets ratio to ~2% by FY25-end. Outlook The bank achieved its target of a consolidated RoE of 18% in 2QFY23 and remains on track to deliver a sustainable RoE of 18% in the medium term. We estimate AXSB to deliver FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.8%/16.9%. AXSB is our top pick for CY23 with a TP of INR1,130 (2.0x Sep’24E ABV + INR94 for subs).

The brokerage house, in a research report, bet on the bank for making its balance sheet granular, all the while increasing the mix of retail loans and improving its provision coverage ratio. This, the research report states, has improved its key metrics such as loan growth, margins and profitability.  “Axis Bank remains focused on building a stronger, consistent, and sustainable franchise. Since asset quality issues are behind, slippages and credit cost will be under control. While the bank will continue to make investments, it expects to bring down the cost-to-assets ratio to 2 percent by FY25-end,” the report marked out.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  At 11 am, the stock was trading at Rs 932 on the NSE, marginally lower than its previous day close of Rs 933. For the year, Axis Bank has gained 38 percent, outperforming Nifty Bank which has gained 22 percent.  The bank achieved its target of a consolidated RoE of 18 percent in 2QFY23, the report said, and remained on track to deliver a sustainable RoE of 18 percent in the medium term. The brokerage house estimates the bank to deliver FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.8 percent and 16.9 percent, respectively.  As per the report, Axis Bank is witnessing a healthy recovery as loan growth has improved to 14-18 percent in the past four quarters as against a 13 percent CAGR through FY19-22. The loan growth was driven by the retail book, which saw an 18 percent CAGR over FY19-22. Small business banking and rural loans have also registered a strong CAGR of 49 percent and 23 percent. Motilal Oswal has estimated a 17 percent CAGR loan growth over FY22-25.  Motilal Oswal has also made a positive projection about the bank’s asset quality, marking out that the credit cost of the bank is likely to undershoot its long-term average at 0.4-0.6 percent over FY22-25.  “Asset quality has improved significantly over the past few years, with slippages moderating to 3 percent in FY22 (2.1 percent in 1HFY23), which led to a decline in the GNPA ratio to 2.5 percent in 1HFY23 vs 5.1 percent in FY20. The net slippage ratio was also low at 0.8 percent/0.4 percent in FY22/1HFY23.”  The bank also has total provisions of Rs 11,630 crore, which amounts to 1.6 percent of the loan book and is the highest among its peers. Axis Bank’s PCR has also improved significantly to 80 percent in the second quarter of FY23, and the restructured book is negligible accounting for only 0.38 percent of loans, which, along with lower BB and below book, will keep the slippages in control.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/motilal-oswal-puts-strong-buy-on-axis-bank-projects-21-gain-in-share-price-9774841.html

On the back of this, the current valuation gap (Axis Bank trading at 1.4x its FY2025E Core BV) vs. its core peer (ICICI Bank at 1.9x its FY2025E Core BV) is expected to narrow down over the next 6-12 months. Concerns on growth in granular retail liabilities vs. peers are expected to fade away as the bank has started gaining market share on CASA front (10% system growth vs. 14% for Axis in the past one year) aided by leveraging digital ecosystem, focusing on corporate salary account acquisition, and cross-sell liability products to existing clients. Further, Citi Bank’s acquisition is expected to improve CASA ratio by 200bps. Branch expansion is likely to further accelerate growth. NIM gap vs. core peer (ICICI Bank) is also narrowing (at 36bps in H1FY2023 vs. 64 bps in H1FY2022). Return on RWA is now closer to its peers; improved underwriting practices by taking learnings from past cycles are key positives. It has already converged on loan growth, credit cost, and ROE with the frontline banks. Due to all these factors, we see the bank emerging as stronger in this leg of upcycle and valuation multiple inching higher closer to its peers. At the CMP, the bank trades at 2.0x/1.7x/1.4x its FY2023E/FY2024E/FY2025E Core BV, offering attractive risk reward.  Outlook We maintain Buy with a revised PT of Rs. 1,140.

axis,2022-12-12T07:51:44+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Amid profit booking, check these top 10 trading ideas by experts for next 3-4 weeks","The banking index has been showing outperformance and is continuing its uptrend after some consolidation. Among private sector banks, Axis Bank is showing strength and has given a breakout above its previous swing high resistance.","After moving closer to 18,900 level in the beginning of December, traders seem to have preferred profit taking and hence the Nifty50 is caught in a bear trap. The index lost more than 1 percent in the week ended December 9, after run-up in previous two consecutive weeks. Slightly hawkish tone by the Reserve Bank of India and caution ahead of FOMC meet weighed on market sentiment despite correction in oil prices amid global recession fears.  The index closed a tad below 18,500, the support which was being held on to for several sessions in the recent past. Overall if the same gets decisively broken then Nifty can take support at crucial 18,400-18,300 area, whereas on the other side, 18,600-18,700 zone is going to be near term resistance followed by new high, experts said.  &quot;The Nifty is now placed slightly above the key support of '20-day EMA' (exponential moving average - 18,465) which coincides with previous swing high of 18,450. Hence, we continue to remain upbeat as long as 18,400 – 18,300 is not violated on a closing basis,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  Until then, he feels any intermediate decline should only be construed as  profit booking before resuming the upward trend.  On the flipside, 18,650 – 18,700 are the levels to watch out for. The moment Nifty surpasses this, one should gear up for yet another milestone of 19,000 in the near future, the expert said.  Traders are advised not to get carried away by such small declines. Rather it’s better to focus more on thematic moves, especially from the broader end of the spectrum, Sameet advised.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the December 9 closing prices:  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Thermax: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,057 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,875 | Target: Rs 2,350 | Return: 14 percent  The stock is in the last leg of a corrective pattern. It could drop to Rs 1,950 or Rs 1,960 levels, where it has seen key support since March 2022.  Technically, it will mark the second low in the last two months. Our advice is to buy the stock 50 percent at current levels and the balance at Rs 1,950 with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,875 and we can keep a target of Rs 2,350 or Rs 2,450 in the medium term, which is the pullback level for the stock.    HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,631 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,590 | Target: Rs 1,722 | Return: 5.6 percent  It is forming a triangle consolidation formation between Rs 1,640 and Rs 1,590 range. It has shown a trending move from Rs 1,365 levels.  The overall formation is suggesting that the current formation is a continuation formation and on the dismissal of Rs 1,642, it will jump to the level, which lies between Rs 1,675 and Rs 1,722.  Buying around Rs 1,630 and Rs 1,620 is appropriate with a stop-loss at Rs 1,590.    Divis Laboratories: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,274 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350 | Target: Rs 2,978 | Return: 9 percent  The stock is forming a series of lower top and lower bottom. On weekly basis, the stock closed below Rs 3,330 level, which was last week's low.  It is negative for the stock and it may witness further weakness till the next level, which is at Rs 2,978. The stock closed on a weekly basis at Rs 3,274 and based on technical analysis, the downside is favourable for short sellers with a stop-loss at Rs 3,350.    Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities  Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC: Buy | LTP: Rs 449.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 490 | Return: 9 percent  Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC has corrected from a high of Rs 503 touched in September 2022. The stock recently found support around the Rs 400 levels in October 2022. This is close to the previous intermediate lows, indicating a double bottom formation. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made higher bottoms in the last few weeks.  Last week, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend a buy between Rs 440-460 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 430 and target at Rs 490.    Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 350.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 332 | Target: Rs 382 | Return: 9 percent  After correcting from a high of Rs 470 in January 2022, Suprajit Engineering found support around Rs 272 levels in March 2022. These are strong supports as they are just above the 200-day EMA.  The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of huge volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.  With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. One can buy between Rs 348-355 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 332 and target at Rs 382.    Bata India: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,679 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,739 | Target: Rs 1,580 | Return: 6 percent  Bata is in a short term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks. Recently, the stock broke down below its recent supports and also reacted from the 20-day SMA last week. This indicates that the downtrend looks set to continue.  Technical indicators are giving negative signals as the stock is now trading below the 20-day and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI are in decline mode and not oversold, which implies potential for more downsides.  We therefore expect the stock to correct further in the coming sessions. One can sell between Rs 1,670-1,684 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,739 and downside target at Rs 1,580.    Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities  Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,227 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,030 | Target: Rs 3,580 | Return: 11 percent  The stock consolidated after retracing 50 percent of prior up-move (Rs 2,560-Rs 3,546) and witnessed a range breakout. The stock also closed above its 20-week EMA and rose to 9-week closing high.  Its weekly Stochastic is positively poised; its RSI gave buy signal, while its MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is on the verge of a bullish cross-over.  The stock has potential to move towards Rs 3,490 initially and Rs 3,680 subsequently.  In case of any decline, the stock will continue to find support at around its 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move.    Colgate Palmolive: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,657 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,570 | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 10 percent  Since couple of weeks, the stock oscillated above its cluster of moving averages (20-week EMA, 50-week EMA and 100-week SMA) and poised for a breakout.  In the last two weeks, the stock witnessed a steady rise with above average volume, which signals that major market participants were in favour of the bulls.  The key technical indicators are positively poised on medium-term as well as short-term timeframe charts. We believe the stock will rebound utilising prior consolidation and move towards its life-time-high.  On the lower side, the stock will find support around its cluster of moving averages.    Dr Reddy's Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,407 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,210 | Target: Rs 4,900 | Return: 11 percent  Post a trendline breakout, the stock again tested that extended line and formed a bullish reversal pattern. The stock also found support around its 100-day SMA and reversed.  This could take the stock towards Rs 4,600 initially and Rs 4,900 subsequently.  Major technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on the near-term timeframe chart.  In case of any volatility, the stock will find support around its long-term moving averages (100-day and 200-day SMAs).    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 934 | Stop-Loss: Rs 908 | Target: Rs 985 | Return: 5.5 percent  The banking index has been showing an outperformance and it is continuing its uptrend after some consolidation phase. Within the private sector banks, Axis Bank is showing strength and has given a breakout above its previous swing high resistance.  The prices above its 20 EMA support, the volumes along the price upmove are good and the RSI oscillator is indicating a positive momentum.  Hence, we expect the uptrend to continue in Axis Bank, so short term traders can look to buy this stock around Rs 934 for potential targets of Rs 969 and Rs 985. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 908.    Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 351 | Stop-Loss: Rs 337 | Target: Rs 376 | Return: 7 percent  The stock has been consolidating within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern since last few months and prices have given a breakout from the pattern on Friday. This entire consolidation is above its weekly 200 EMA which indicates that long term uptrend is still intact.  The volumes have improved in last couple of sessions and if the stock gives a follow up move, then it could lead to a decent trended upmove going ahead.  Hence, traders can look to buy the stock around current market price of Rs 351 for potential targets around Rs 365 and Rs 376. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 337.

The stock has seen a breakout of downward sloping resistance trend line adjoining multiple points - November 11, December 1, and December 5 this year.","The market reversed some of the previous day's losses and closed third of a percent higher on December 8, backed largely by banking stocks. The Nifty50 has been taking a good support at 18,500 and closed tad above 18,600 on the weekly expiry day.  The index was up by nearly 50 points at 18,609 and formed a bullish candle on the daily charts, while the BSE Sensex jumped more than 150 points to 62,571.

The stock has seen a breakout of downward sloping resistance trend line adjoining multiple points - November 11, December 1, and December 5.  Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Bharat Forge  After a short term correction, the stock has formed higher bottom formation and bounced back sharply. On last Thursday, the stock rallied over 4 percent and formed long bullish candle on daily charts which is largely positive.  For the positional traders now, 20-day SMA (simple moving average) or Rs 850 would be the key level to watch. If stock manages to trade above the same then the stock could retest the level of Rs 890-895. On the flip side, below Rs 850 uptrends would be vulnerable.    Axis Bank  On December 8, the stock made a fresh all-time high of Rs 943.95. In this quarter so far, it rallied nearly 30 percent.  On daily and weekly charts the stock is consistently holding higher high and higher low formation which is largely positive. However, due to temporary overbought conditions we could see some profit booking at higher level.  Hence buying on correction and sell on rallies would be the ideal strategy for the short term traders.  For the traders, Rs 920 and Rs 900 would act as a strong support zone while Rs 980-1000 could be the immediate resistance zone for the bulls. Below Rs 900, traders may prefer to exit from the trading long positions.    Godfrey Phillips India  On last Thursday, the stock rallied nearly 7 percent and registered a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,949.95. A promising price volume rally, range breakout formation and long bullish candle on daily charts supported further uptrend from the current levels.  For the breakout traders now, Rs 1,830 would act as a sacrosanct level. Above the same, the stock could move up to Rs 2,000. Further upside may also continue which could lift the stock till Rs 2,055.

The panel also decided to remain focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.  The repo rate, the rate at which the central bank (RBI) lends money to commercial banks, has been raised by 35 basis points to 6.25 percent, from 5.9 percent earlier. Jayanth R Varma voted against the repo rate hike, while the rest MPC members were in favour of rate hike.  The moderation in rate hike (from 50 bps hike in earlier meetings) was largely on the expected lines, given the inflation above its targeted zone and following the Fed path (which already indicated balanced approach between containing inflation and fostering growth). The policy stance may indicate another rate hike on the cards in the February 2023 meeting, whereas the central bank lowering its growth forecast for the current financial year, given the global headwinds was also on expected lines, experts said.  &quot;Markets were expecting a slight moderation in the stance but it continues to be the withdrawal of accommodative stance while supporting growth. This may be interpreted that further action on the rate front can still happen before arriving at the terminal rate,&quot; Ajit Banerjee, Chief Investment Officer at Shriram Life Insurance, said.  Pankaj Pathak, Fund Manager - Fixed Income at Quantum AMC also believes a continuation of the stance as “withdrawal of accommodation” indicates that the rate hiking cycle in India is by no means over. &quot;We would expect at least another 25 basis points of a rate hike in February next year before we get any closer to the terminal rate,&quot; he said.  The Reserve Bank of India has reduced its FY23 GDP forecast to 6.8 percent from 7 percent, but retained the CPI inflation forecast unchanged at 6.7 percent. CPI inflation for October eased to a three-month low of 6.77 percent, down from 7.41 percent in September.  The lowering full-year GDP growth forecast is predominantly factoring in the prevailing global headwinds and would likely to impact India's GDP growth, Banerjee said, adding the inflation forecasts for the residual period of FY23 have been marginally increased from the previous forecast in view of the higher inflation level still prevailing.  The market reacted negatively to the policy, maybe due to increasing possibility for further rate hikes in next policy meeting and lowering growth forecast. The Nifty50 fell 50 points to 18,593, while the BSE Sensex was down more than 100 points at 62,512.

Returns are calculated based on December 7 closing price:  Expert: Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst of Technical and Derivative at Reliance Securities  Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,698 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,430 | Target: Rs 7,450 | Return: 11 percent  The stock is holding its 100-week SMA (simple moving average) and trading sideways in an inside range on the weekly charts.  It has completed his time and price correction over the past 13 weeks from its recent high of Rs 7800 level it tested in September 2022.  A stable move above its key band of daily moving averages will support a strong up-move and risk reward remains in favour from current levels.  Therefore, we recommend directional long position for a target of Rs 7450 with a stop-loss of Rs 6,430.    Shriram Transport Finance Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,326 | Stop-Loss: 1,225 | Target: Rs 1,530 | Return: 15 percent  The stock has crossed its 200 day average with strong volumes and positive price performance over the past few days.

He also has a savings account with Axis Bank. After Citibank announced that it will transfer all its banking services in India to Axis, he does not know the fate of his accounts.  “Will I have two savings accounts with Axis Bank? Will they shut down one of my accounts? I have tried contacting both banks but to no avail. From their end, there has not been any communication concerning this,” Mamidala said.  Confusion with transfers   Like Mamidala, many customers are confused and worried as to what will happen to their accounts and services with Citibank after the transfer to Axis Bank.  “Without knowing what product we get, how do we transfer the relationship?” tweeted Vinod Kumar, a Citibank customer.  Satvik Sehgal, another customer, said that he is planning to close his account with Citibank.  Experts have said that some Citibank users have resorted to closing their accounts and services due to the absence of communication from banks concerning their issues.  A response to a frequently asked questions on Citibank’s website read, “The transition will be completed over time, and in an orderly fashion, with due notice. We will keep all stakeholders informed of updates as they materialize.”  Kashif Ansari, an assistant professor of taxation and personal finance at Jindal University and credit card expert, opined that Axis Bank may allow additional credit card customers from Citibank than its credit card holding limits.  &quot;Axis Bank has a limit of three credit cards per customer. If customers with accounts in both banks have credit cards amounting to more than three, initially Axis Bank will allow this,” he said.  Consent communication  In a November 18 email to customers, Citibank mentioned several transactions that if undertaken on or after November 21 would be taken as consent to move to Axis Bank. For the last few months, the bank has been seeking customer consent for the transfer, and the latest communication is for customers who are yet to agree to move their services to Axis Bank.  “While Citibank has reached out over email, I have specifically decided to not give them consent since I do not wish to deal with Axis Bank,” said Sehgal, the Citibank customer quoted earlier.  Subhankar, another customer with Citibank, tweeted “Citibank has started sending the confirmation of the transfer of relationship to Axis Bank. If you have made any debit transactions of any kind, you’ll receive this message now.”  &quot;The overall consent exercise began in July 2022 and we have been seeing an excellent response from our customers with nearly 70% of balances already consented to shift. Customers who transfer will continue to receive the same services with the same products post the transition. The recent communication is an essential step to ensure there isn’t any service disruption and for our customers’ convenience,&quot; Citibank said in a statement to Moneycontrol.  Ansari said that generally during mergers and acquisition (m&amp;amp;a) deals, the acquiring party initially tweaks some of its rules to allow the inflow of customers.  “Increasing the number of cards a person can hold is one of the things that Axis Bank can do so that customers do not worry,” he opined.  &quot;We have not received any significant adverse feedback on this specific communication, and we are in close touch with all customers. On the contrary, consent by conduct very much allows customers to say that they don’t wish to transfer. A customer who has already consented can also exit any time after the transfer in the same manner as the normal closure of a bank account,&quot; said the Citibank statement.  Communications sent to Axis Bank were unanswered till the time of publishing the story.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/some-citibank-customers-are-confused-amid-transfer-of-services-9641361.html

The entire supply of growth, which is the advances side of the balance sheet, banks have to help,” he said.  &quot;All banks are fighting for a larger share of deposits and for this, the lending interest rates are going up, which will bring in more money, and banks can then funnel the same to productive outcomes,” he added.  Talking about a megatrend, Krishnamurthy said formalisation of the economy will push the wealth-creation power of the financial sector.  “More of the economy is getting formalised, cash trades and other financial transactions, which were not visible earlier are getting into the banking system. This will benefit the banks. This will also result in the boom of payments and wealth management businesses as well as create more jobs.

Management sounded confident of maintaining operational performance as cushion on NIM would continue while medium term guidance is to reduce opex/assets by end FY25 to ~2% (FY22 was 2.18%) by focusing on segments that are opex lighter (CBG, BuB, SBB etc.). Loan growth would largely hinge on deposit accretion and as per AXSB system deposit growth could remain weak for 2-3 quarters, however, profitability would not be compromised. CITI acquisition may be a bit delayed and could see fruition post Q4FY23. Near term growth would be funded through internal accruals and capital raise would be evaluated only after CITI acquisition. Over medium term, bank would like to deliver on aspirational ROE of 18%. For FY24E/25E, we lower opex by 4.5%/6.5% and raise PAT by 5.5%/8.0%. With FY25E RoA/RoE at 1.6%/16% for AXSB, if earnings quality sustains each quarter, discount to ICICIB should narrow from 29% to 20%.  Outlook AXSB remains one of our top picks with compelling valuation at 1.8x and we maintain multiple at 2.3x on Sep’24 ABV. Reiterate BUY and slightly raise TP from Rs1080 to Rs1100.

The decline is mainly due to an expanded base and slowing of export revenue amid fears of a recession that could affect demand. However, the performance of the energy sector, which is closely linked to crude oil prices, will hold the key, said Mayuresh Joshi, head of equity research at William O’Neil &amp;amp; Co. Controlled inflation, a peaked out bad-loan cycle and good agricultural output will lend some support to the Nifty 50, said G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics Research. Bajaj Finserv, Bharti Airtel, Axis Bank, Adani Enterprises and Tata Motors are likely to be the biggest contributors to EPS growth in the Nifty 50 index in FY24, according to a Moneycontrol analysis. A real turnaround in EPS growth is expected in Axis Bank and Tata Motors, according to Bloomberg data. On the other hand, EPS growth is narrowing for Bharti Airtel and Adani Enterprises.  How the valuations stack up: According to Bloomberg, the Nifty Index’s PE is expected to contract to 19.2 times in FY24 from 22.9 times in FY23 mainly on account of higher earnings for the next financial year.  According to Gautam Duggad, head of research – institutional equities at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the Nifty price to earnings for the next 12 months at 20x is well within the 10-year average of 19.6 times because earnings have caught up while the markets were little changed for the past 12 months. With earnings growth of 16-17 percent for FY24, the markets should, by and large, reflect underlying earnings without much de-rating/re-rating. On a granular basis, Axis Bank and Adani Enterprises are trading at higher valuations than their 10-year average, while Bharti Airtel, ONGC and Tata Motors are trading at steeper discounts.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/which-stocks-will-drive-the-nifty-50-from-here-9603051.html

It also raised its long-term and short-term issuer credit rating on the lender to 'BBB-/A-3' from 'BB+/B'. They kept outlook 'Stable' for the bank.  &quot;Our upgrade reflects Axis Bank's good asset quality and our expectation that the bank will maintain that over the next one to two years. India's robust economic growth should support borrowers' creditworthiness,&quot; the ratings agency said in a press release.  On the stable outlook front, S&amp;amp;P Global said Axis Bank will maintain its strong market position in India's banking sector over the next two years. The bank's capitalization should stay comfortable, notwithstanding an expected decline from the acquisition of Citigroup Inc.'s retail portfolio in India.  The ratings agency predicts Axis Bank's weak loans, defined as nonperforming loans and standard restructured loans (including loans restructured due to COVID), could decline to 2.5 percent-3.0 percent of total customer loans by end-March 2023, from 3.7 percent as of March 31, 2022.  COVID restructured loans have also fallen to 0.4 percent of total loans as of end-September 2022, from 0.6 percent as of Dec. 31, 2021. Credit costs could likely stay below 1 percent, while asset quality risks remain contained.  The higher interest rates and high inflation usually painful for small and midsize enterprise sector and low-income households. However, in their base case of moderate interest-rate hikes, these risks are manageable for Axis Bank, the agency added.  &quot;The bank's ample provisioning and capital buffers can help absorb a moderate rise in credit stress. The bank's tighter risk management should also support credit quality. Axis Bank's asset quality is likely to stay better than the Indian sector average and comparable to that of similar rated international peers over the next two years,&quot; they said.  The agency had warned that they may lower the ratings on Axis Bank if the bank's asset quality deteriorates sharply. This could happen if economic conditions in India deteriorate, resulting in asset quality stress for the bank.  An upgrade of Axis Bank is unlikely over the next one to two years. This is because an upgrade will require an improvement in the bank's financial profile as well as the sovereign credit rating on India, S&amp;amp;P said.  Earlier this year, the ratings agency had revised private lender's outlook from &quot;stable&quot; to &quot;positive&quot;, citing improved asset quality.  While, it affirmed 'BB+' long-term and 'B' short-term issuer credit ratings on the bank under revised criteria.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sp-upgrades-axis-banks-ratings-to-bbb-a-3-on-improving-asset-quality-9575231.html

It was organised by ex-Sebi chairman M Damodaran's advocacy Excellence Enablers on Thursday.  Going a step further, he warned that &quot;the country's banking system now relies on two three big companies for their software service requirements, and this can lead to emerging risks in case these companies stop investing and ensuring that those platforms are adaptable to this new world&quot;.  Chaudhry said such concentration is leading to pressure on the banking system to invest in technology in order to take care of the macro requirements.  &quot;We have to bear all the cost. Again, it comes down to someone doing something and we've to ensure that there is sustainability and resilience. So, the inter-connectedness is causing problems now,&quot; he added.  Noting the dominant role of large non-banking technology companies, or bigtech, and financial technology firms in the financial system, the Reserve Bank had in June issued draft guidelines on outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled services by the regulated entities.  The regulator's aim is to ensure effective management of risks in outsourcing IT activities, such as network security, cloud computing, application service providers etc.  In the past, the Reserve Bank had warned that bigtech can scale up rapidly and pose risks to financial stability, which can arise from increased disintermediation of incumbent institutions.  The RBI paper had also issued a draft paper specifying norms pertaining to the use of cloud computing services and outsourcing of the security operations centre. It had then proposed that entities be required to set up a risk management framework for the outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled services, and the risks associated with it.  Such complex intertwined operational linkages between bigtech firms and financial institutions can lead to concentration and contagion risks and issues relating to potential anti-competitive behaviour, the central bank had said in the June 2022 edition of the financial stability report.  The RBI paper has said owing to their large size and clientele, big tech poses serious barriers in creating a level-playing field to promote innovation in financial technology and have the financial muscle to withstand competition. Also, due to their adoption as third-party service providers, they have become the underlying platform on which a host of services are offered.  &quot;This uniquely positions bigtech to easily acquire cross-functional databases that can be exploited for generating innovative product offerings, making them dominant players in the market,&quot; the RBI paper had warned and pointed out that going forward, regulations will need to be mindful of the new inter-linkages that bigtech might create with the existing financial institutions.  Given that fintechs are here to stay, innovation will invariably be ahead of regulations, Chaudhry said, adding due to this, regulations will continue to increase hereon to push more oversight over newer types of businesses.  With regulations and supervision expected to rise many-fold from a technology perspective, the onus on entities will also increase and they will need to invest more in technology to protect against issues, such as cyber security, which is already being seen, he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/financial-sector-reliance-on-2-3-big-tech-companies-poses-major-risks-axis-bank-ceo-9556461.html

axis,2022-10-31T15:46:50+05:30,Siddhi Nayak,"Rate war to mop up deposits may hurt banks’ margins, say experts","Net Interest Margin — the amount of money that a bank earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits — is an indicator of profitability and growth. If deposit rates outpace lending rates, then bank NIMs will shrink","The aggressive drive for deposits in the backdrop of tight liquidity conditions may have an adverse effect on bank margins next fiscal year, say experts.  Banks have been aggressively accumulating deposits by offering higher, lucrative interest rates to depositors following four consecutive repo rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  The central bank is fighting a tough battle to contain persistently high retail inflation, which is hitting common households hard.  The impact of aggressive deposit mobilisation is likely to weigh on banks’ net interest margins (NIM) in the coming quarters, banking experts and analysts told Moneycontrol on October 31. In banking parlance, NIM refers to the amount of money that a bank earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits. It is an indicator of a bank's profitability and growth.  “There are expectations of a rate hike in the next monetary policy, which will still allow banks to pass on the incremental cost to advances linked to the benchmark, and deposit rates will continue to rise with a lag, protecting the NIM for FY23,” said Aditya Acharekar, associate director at CareEdge.  “However, some impact on margins may be seen in the first half of FY24,” he added.  Also read: In search of deposits, bankers embark on door-to-door campaign  Rate transmission and NIM  Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted to the economy when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates based on the RBI's rate actions. For instance, if the RBI hikes the repo rate, then banks will have to borrow short-term funds at a higher cost from the central bank. Banks are also expected to pass on the benefit to borrowers by offering high-interest rates.  Often, monetary transmission happens based on the prevailing liquidity situation. Typically, banks are quick to pass on rate hikes to consumers through loans, but a pass-through to deposits comes with a lag. For much of FY23, banks took advantage of this scenario, which helped them sustain or improve their NIM.  “We are prepared to take a hit on NIMs next fiscal year, but that is an obvious situation given that we have to fund the credit growth through deposits,” said a banker with a private bank on the condition of anonymity. “Mobilising deposits looks like the way forward.”  According to Arun Malhotra, founding partner and portfolio manager of CapGrow Capital Advisors, banks will have to forego NIMs as they could be compressed in the range of 20-25 bps in the short to medium term. Banks, according to Malhotra, may need to increase spreads on fresh repo-linked loans in the next two to four quarters.  In the July-September quarter, HDFC Bank’s core NIM was at 4.1 percent on total assets, and 4.3 percent based on interest-earning assets. Axis Bank’s NIM was at 3.96 percent, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s NIM stood at 5.17 percent in the reporting quarter. Relatively smaller peers IndusInd Bank and IDBI Bank reported NIMs of 4.24 percent and 4.37 percent, respectively.  The rate picture   State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, recently made an upward revision in retail term deposit interest rates on amounts below Rs 2 crore, by up to 80 basis points. One bps equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. Indeed, most banks have increased their FD rates following the RBI’s 190 bps repo rate hike in the current cycle to rein in inflation.    According to bankers and experts, the ‘war’ for deposits is likely to continue as the RBI hikes rates further and as credit growth continues to expand. This could happen via aggressive deposit mobilisation in the coming months, said bankers. Analysts and economists expect the RBI to increase the repo rate to 6.50 percent by March from 5.90 percent currently.  Sumant Kathpalia, managing director and chief executive officer of IndusInd Bank, said that the lender would continue with its strategy to granularise deposits. The bank’s liabilities will be priced 50-to-75 bps higher than the market, he said at a conference call after the July-September earnings.  On average, banks have raised interest rates in the range of 25-80 bps across tenors. Fixed deposit rates of top banks in the three-year to five-year tenor for amounts below Rs 1 crore currently stand between 5.65 percent and 6.75 percent.  “It is natural for banks to be aggressive as liquidity remains constrained and credit growth is way ahead of deposit growth,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice-president, of research, at Kotak Securities. “Many banks have been aggressive already, and some have reached a point where a further increase in rates will cause a passthrough in borrower rates.”  Rush for deposits  The primary reason for the rush for deposits is the tightening liquidity in the banking system due to heavy currency leakage and heightened spending on account of the festive season. The RBI’s dollar sales in the foreign exchange market to prevent the rupee’s depreciation have also tightened liquidity.  The mismatch between credit growth and deposit growth has forced most banks to offer high rates on deposits and increase promotional activities for the same.  “If we look at the July-September banking results for FY23, one consistent finding is that advances are growing faster than deposits,” said Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investment.  “As a result, we anticipate banks raising their deposit rates in order to maintain CASA (current account savings account) deposits or raise money through term deposits. Additionally, due to the dearth of liquidity and good credit growth demand, all the banks are expected to be aggressive in mobilising deposits.”  This trend is likely to continue as credit growth continues to expand, interest rate hikes become more entrenched and liquidity in the system dries up further.  “We are expecting inflationary pressures to persist, and so rates may keep climbing till the end of this financial year,” said Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer at BankBazaar.com. “We may see small banks offer 8 percent or more (FD rates) during this period. If inflation persists, large banks will follow the trend.”  Analysts and industry experts said that the impact of the deposit rate hikes will also depend on the bank's liability and asset profile. Banks having granular, retail-based liability and floating advances are better placed and will witness a minimal impact on their NIMs, they said.  Jindal Haria, a director at India Ratings and Research, said that most banks would have to continue to increase deposit rates till they are confident deposit growth will mirror loan growth. NIMs, however, could expand some more before deposit pricing catches up fully, he said.  Fund-raising to continue  Apart from mobilising deposits, experts also expect banks to tap the market for funds to meet credit demand.  “Banks will have to raise funds from the capital markets through infra bonds, sub-debt and perpetual bonds quickly for long-term funding requirements to augment credit growth as CDs (certificates of deposit) and FDs may not match their long-term funding requirements,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.  Further, banks that are not able to get sufficient funds through FDs and CDs due to tight liquidity conditions will have to continuously increase rates to compete with their peers, added Srinivasan.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rate-war-to-mop-up-deposits-may-hurt-banks-margins-say-experts-9419661.html

NIM boost was driven by better loan yields that was a function of higher repo linked pool, increased retail share, focus on rupee loans and shedding of RIDF bonds. Loan growth too was better at 4.2% QoQ mainly led by corporate/SME although deposit growth was slower. Asset quality improved again with lower slippages driving GNPA decline of 26bps QoQ while OTR reduced by 11bps to 0.65%. As per the bank, Citi acquisition may materialize in Q4FY23. We upgrade FY23/24E earnings by ~30%/10% due to higher NII and lower provisions. However, our multiple is maintained at 2.3x as RoE in FY24/25E does not surpass 15%. Levers for RoE expansion are fall in opex/assets and higher loan/deposit accretion. Outlook Re-rating beyond 2.3x would hinge on RoA/RoE gap to ICICIB reducing. Rolling forward to Sep’24 ABV we raise TP from Rs940 to Rs1080. Reiterate BUY.

This, coupled with continued lower LLP, led to the 24% beat on PAT, which came in at Rs53.3bn. Credit growth was comparatively modest at 18% YoY/4% QoQ vs peers’ (23% YoY/6% QoQ), due to sluggish growth in the retail book at 23% YoY/3% QoQ despite a lower base. However, NIM expanded 57bps YoY/36bps QoQ to 3.96%, mainly on higher growth in the SME/mid-corporate book, higher LDR &amp;amp; re-pricing benefit. Mgmt aims to sustain margins at current levels, but reckons that cost pressure will increase as deposit growth accelerates. Factoring-in the better &amp;amp; faster than expected delivery on margins, coupled with contained opex, we expect the bank to clock healthy core-profitability CAGR at 25% over FY23-25E. This along with continued lower LLP, given higher specific + contingent provision buffer, should drive-up earnings. Thus, we revise our earnings by 15%/11%/6% for FY23E/24E/25E. Outlook We retain our long-term BUY rating on the stock. We revise our TP to Rs1,110/share (vs Rs1,020 earlier) valuing the standalone bank at 1.8x Sep-24E ABV and subsidiaries at Rs82/share, given the potential steady improvement in FY23-25E RoA/RoE to 1.6- 1.7%/16% (without factoring-in any capital-raise), respectively.

axis,2022-10-21T21:02:08+05:30,Manish M. Suvarna,Axis Bank Q2 result | Here are 5 key points analysts highlight,The profit growth came higher than a 45 percent increase in net profit for the fiscal second quarter that analysts estimated.,"Axis Bank, on October 20, posted a 70 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its net profit to Rs 5,329.77 crore in the July-September quarter, up from Rs 3,133 crore in the same quarter of the previous financial year.  The profit growth came higher than a 45 percent increase in net profit for the fiscal second quarter that analysts estimated.  The bank’s net interest income (NII) went up by 31 percent on YoY basis to Rs 10,360.3 crore, from Rs 7,900 crore in Q2FY22. It was Rs 9,384 crore in Q1FY23. The net interest margin (NIM) was at 3.96 percent, which is a rise of 57 basis points (bps) YoY and 36 bps rise QoQ.  Here are the top five key points analysts have highlighted from the private lender's Q2FY23 earnings:  Profit after tax (PAT)  After the robust growth in PAT of the private lender in the reporting quarter, most analysts have revised their estimates for the current financial year and next financial year slightly upward. The net profit of the private lender grew 70 percent in the quarter under review.  Some analysts pegged PAT in the current financial year to rise in the range of 9 percent and 17 percent, and in the net financial year, it is seen in the 2-11 percent range.  &quot;Buoyed by a stellar performance in 2QFY23, we revise PAT for FY23E/24E by 17 percent/11 percent, respectively. This is driven by healthy NII trends, moderating open (on the back of improved efficiency) and reduction in credit cost,&quot; Motilal Oswal Investment Services said in a report.  B&amp;amp;K Securities said the performance of the private lender could also be influenced by the potential capital raise, though the bank sounded confident of a capital raise only in the next financial year.  Treasury Income  The private lender, in the reporting quarter, reported a sharp fall in treasury losses and it stood at Rs 86 crore compared to a loss of Rs 667 crore in the previous quarter and a profit of Rs 473 crore for the same quarter last year.  The bank officials, during the earnings conference call, said that the mark-to-market (MTM) is largely in their corporate bond book. The rise in yields on corporate bonds have impacted their MTM.  Eighty percent of the bank’s corporate bonds are rated AA+ and above, and 96 percent is rated A- and above. &quot;We do not expect an economic loss on this book. All else being equal, the pull to par period on this book is about four to five years,&quot; officials added.  On this front, analysts believe that treasury losses of Axis Bank will likely remain moderate in the upcoming quarters on stable long-term yields on government securities and corporate bonds.  &quot;Treasury losses are momentary as the bank has to make MTM adjustments. We may see some or minor gains in the treasury, going forward,&quot; said Ajit Kabi, Equity Research Analyst (Institutional, Banks &amp;amp; NBFCs), at LKP Securities Limited.  Deposit growth   Analysts were disappointed with the deposit growth of the bank, but expect it to rise in the next two quarters. &quot;The deposit growth of the bank in the current quarter is below par. The bank needs to mobilise deposits further to maintain CDR below 90 percent. We expect the deposit growth to revamp from next quarter,&quot; Kabi of LKP Securities added.  In the reporting quarter, the private lender's deposit stood at Rs 8.2 lakh crore, and growth remained below par of 10.1 percent YoY and 0.9 percent on-quarter.  The CASA (QAB) stood at 43 percent and CRAR stood at 16.42 percent with CET 1 of 14.55 percent. Additionally, LCR of 121 percent with an excess SLR of Rs 55,500 crore.  &quot;The bank needs to grow the deposits to maintain a CDR of below 90 percent,&quot; said LKP Securities in a report.  Net interest margins (NIM)   The bank’s net interest income stood at Rs 10,400 crore; up 17 percent on-year and 6 percent on-quarter. The bank’s NIMs expanded by 36 bps to 3.96 percent on the back of slightly higher cost of funds (4.09 percent) and cost of deposits (3.8 percent). Non-interest income grew by 31 percent on-quarter.  The management hopes to achieve structural improvement in NIM going forward, owing to improvement in mix of loans versus investments on the assets side, higher share of low-cost deposits and reduction in RIDF bonds (which have negative spread) as incremental allocations have stopped since the bank is PSL-compliant.  &quot;Our operating margins and NIM are in the zone of the best-performing franchises. We see acceleration in our focus segments and there is all-round improvement in all key performance metrics on deposits and assets,&quot; officials said in a conference call.  Asset quality   Most analysts were happy with the improvement in the asset quality in the reporting quarter. This is because gross slippages declined 8 percent on-quarter to Rs 33,800 crore.  Consequently, net NPAs declined 13 bps QoQ to 51 basis points.   The restructured pool reported lower meaningfully at Rs 30,000 crore (38 bps of GCA) v/s Rs 3.400 crore in the previous quarter. The bank carries a provision of 23 percent on restructured loans, which is in excess of regulatory limits. The corporate segment has 26 bps of loan book under restructuring, while Retail and SME segments carry restructuring of 55 bps and 2 bps, respectively.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-bank-q2-result-here-are-5-key-points-analysts-highlight-9373571.html

","Axis Bank share price touched a 52-week high of Rs 873.90, rising nearly six percent in early trade on October 21, a day after the private sector lender reported its September quarter earnings.  Axis Bank on October 20 posted a 70 percent year-on-year rise in its net profit for the September quarter at Rs 5,329.77, beating estimates. Sequentially, net profit grew 29 percent.  Net interest income went up 31 percent year on year to Rs 10,360.3 crore. Net interest margin was at 3.96 percent, clocking a year on year rise of 57 basis points and sequential increase of 36 bps.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after June quarter earnings:  Motilal Oswal  Axis Bank delivered stellar performance in the September quarter, driven by sharp margin expansion and a significant decline in provisions along with improving trends in cost metrics.  Business growth recovered in the quarter under review after a sequential decline in the previous quarter. Asset quality continues to improve, aided by moderation in slippages and healthy recoveries, and upgrades. Restructured book moderated further while higher provisioning buffer provides comfort.  Buoyed by an exemplary performance, we revise profit after tax for FY23/24 by 17/11 percent respectively. We estimate Axis Bank to deliver FY24 return on assets/equity (RoA/RoE) of 1.8/18.1 percent respectively. We reiterate our buy rating with a target price of Rs 975 (2.0x FY24 adjusted book value)  Sharekhan  The bank is looking for a sustainable growth path in terms of loan growth, led by retail, SME, and mid-corporate segments in a granular manner along with a focus on mobilisation of low-cost granular liability and higher spending on tech. New digital product initiatives, both in asset and liability segments, are growing well, as reflected in strong acquisition growth.  With high provision coverage ratio and a strong balance sheet, the bank can absorb shocks from any unanticipated future risk. We believe its valuations are reasonable, given structural improvement visible in the franchise, and the bank provides an attractive risk-reward ratio.  LKP Research  We value the standalone bank at a price to book value of 2.1x FY24 adjusted book value per share of Rs 478 and arrive at a price target of Rs 1,005. We recommend buy with a potential upside of 22 percent from current levels.  Morgan Stanley  We have maintained ‘overweight’ call on the stock and raised the target to Rs 1,150.  Deposit growth is muted, but expect acceleration by the second half of the fiscal.  We expect the stock to re-rate amid higher margin/better operating leverage.  JPMorgan  We have upgraded the rating of Axis Bank to overweight and raised the target price to Rs 990 from Rs 780 per share.  A 36 basis point sequential improvement in net interest margin is a key positive surprise and margin improvement drives 16 percent increase in FY23/24 earnings per share.  Valuations are attractive, and currently 25 percent below peer group.  Goldman Sachs  We keep a buy rating on Axis Bank with a target of Rs 1,053 per share. Gains are likely to sustain and push up pre-provision operating profit-return on asset.  The September quarter should drive earnings upgrade and re-rate valuation multiple.  At 09:17 hrs Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 856.35, up Rs 30.15, or 3.65 percent on the BSE.

The statement comes against the backdrop of two orders by the insurance sector watchdog Irdai in the last few days, wherein Max has been fined Rs 3 crore while a penalty of Rs 2 crore has been imposed on the bank regarding the deal on concerns over valuations.  ''We believe all the rules and regulations have been followed through the entire deal process,'' Chaudhry, the bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, told reporters on a call.

The bank, which has completed acquiring 13 per cent of the overall 20 per cent stake it has been allowed to purchase, is committed to increase the stake, he added.  ''We believe we have done everything the right way. Irdai has a different view. We are in conversation with them,'' he said.  When asked if it has received any communication from the markets regulator Sebi as well regarding the deal, Chaudhry replied in the negative.  He said the bank's internal probe in the insider trading matter involving executives from its asset management business has revealed that one of the persons has violated the securities law but the amount involved is not substantial.  The bank has shared the report with the capital markets regulator, and is in touch with Sebi for further actions, he said.  Meanwhile, on the over Rs 12,000 crore deal to acquire the domestic retail business of American lender Citi, Chaudhry exuded confidence of finishing the deal by end of March 2023 but also said that it may slip into the June quarter.

The country's third largest private sector lender in a communication on its website stated that the benchmark one-year MCLR is up by 25 basis points to 8.35 per cent with effect from October 18, 2022.  The hike in MCLR rates by Axis Bank follows peer lenders increasing lending rates in response to a 50 basis increase in the repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on September 30. Earlier, Axis Bank charged 8.10 per cent on one-year tenor MCLR--which is the benchmark for the lenders to price most of the consumer loans such as auto, personal and home.  Among other tenors from overnight to one-three and-six months, the new rates are in the range of 8.15 -8.30 per cent, up by 0.25 per cent each. The two year MCLR comes at 8.45 per cent and three year tenor will be 8.50 per cent. These rates will be valid till the next review, Axis Bank said.

Bankers, fintech players and journalists were all there, revelling in one of the most glittering events in the banking landscape.  The event was the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar Merchant app, which would facilitate instant, digital and paperless merchant on-boarding for the bank’s customers. The app was developed by HDFC Bank in partnership with Mintoak Innovations, a merchant SaaS (software as a service) platform.  Such events, to launch their digital initiatives, have become the new normal in the banking space. Banks today are no longer confined to their traditional brick-and-mortar setup or the exhausting paperwork of old. They are getting with it.  Fintechs fuelling change   A major reason for banks constantly revolutionising and upgrading their digital services is the rise of fintechs. Relying on smartphones for almost everything is the new normal, particularly when it comes to financial services. Fintech companies have become an integral part of the country’s economy, keeping it on the move.  Today, India has more than 7,000 fintech startups, operating in various segments. Such is the breadth of their presence that they have a finger in every pie, from payments and online credit facilities to subscription management and peer-to-peer lending.  With the growing presence of fintechs, banks have realised that they need to gear up on the technology front. Banks are using artificial intelligence to ensure smooth customer identification and authentication, while also mimicking live employees through chatbots and voice assistants.  The use of Aadhaar and video know-your-customer (KYC) along with card-less cash withdrawals and paperless customer on-boarding are some of the tools that reflect acceleration in the digitisation of banking in India.  Gone are the days when consumers had to wait for hours to reach the front of the queue, complete formalities, fill forms and access customer care for assistance at banks. With fintech banking solutions, self-service capabilities provide customers with operational processes that were previously only available via a physical branch. Not just that, bank-to-bank payments have become the new normal.  The opportunity to tap this trend is huge. According to an E&amp;amp;Y report, only about 12 percent of Indian adults—fewer than 20 percent of account owners —had made a digital merchant payment in 2021. However, two-thirds of those who made a digital merchant payment did so for the first time after the onset of COVID-19. Also, the share of account owners with an inactive account in India is 35 percent, which was the highest globally in 2021.  Fintechs have been driving this change.  “The primary evolution that the fintech players in the country have brought in is that they have digitalised financial processes. One of the major trends in the fintech sector is digital lending, through which borrowers can avail of a loan through applications on their mobile,” said Mahesh Shukla, founder of PayMe, a fintech.  According to Shukla, fintechs have also significantly reduced and also simplified the documentation process. One of the major challenges in conventional banking is that it was earlier difficult for people in rural areas to access loans. Fintech has made it easy for people from all parts of the country to do so online, added Shukla.  Globally, too, cross-border remittance is a growing opportunity, with payment volumes expected to cross the $156 trillion mark in 2022, according to the E&amp;amp;Y report. Banks would require technology to cater to this growth, something that fintech companies are already providing.  Also read: HDFC Bank aiming to onboard 2 crore merchants in the next three years: top official  Rise in fintechs  As of July 2022, India had over 7,300 fintech startups, according to &quot;The Winds of Change&quot; report presented by EY during the 2022 Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai. The EY report said Indian fintechs received $7.8 billion in funding in 2021, way more than the $2.9 billion they received in 2020.  According to the Chiratae and EY report, lending AUMs in Indian fintech have the potential to grow from $38 billion currently to $515 billion by 2030.  Fintechs are increasingly looking to capture underserved markets with their presence, convenience and technology. With the growing number of fintechs in India, banks are beginning to feel the heat and are gearing up on the technology front.  Kotak Mahindra Bank, for example, hired a chief technology officer recently, while other big lenders such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are ramping up tech teams through lateral hiring.  Fino Payments Bank has also appointed a Chief Digital Officer and plans to recruit many people for this division to drive digital banking among the youth.  “Several years back, most banks and large institutions began hiring Chief Digital Officers or Chief Data Officers. These trends are normal every time an industry goes through a massive change,” said Amit Das, chief executive officer and co-founder of Think360.ai, a Mumbai-based data science company.  “In a way, with the growth of fintechs, banks are aspiring to become savvier, and the advent of transformative technologies like AI (artificial intelligence) will force these realignments.”  Das’ views were corroborated by Kotak Mahindra Bank’s first chief technology officer, Milind Nagnur. In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol on September 14, Nagnur spoke of an important shift — that of viewing the bank as a software engineering-focused organisation. In his view, the new definition of trust in banking for customers is not about the safety of assets, but about how dependable a bank’s digital offerings are.    Are banks worried?  According to bankers, the rise of fintechs has indeed revolutionised the lending industry, with most traditional banks trying to catch up with fintechs. If anything, fintech lending has only threatened the ‘traditional’ way of banking and lending, which is good for customers and the market. However, it is too nascent to say that they could replace banks altogether, they added.  Banks have superior funding franchises, arguably more underwriting expertise, and a widespread distribution or collection network that is also becoming a lot more digital. Fintech companies have better technology capabilities, user interfaces, and innovative solutions.  According to industry players, both banks and fintech companies have realised the advantages the other offers and have come together to offer comprehensive solutions.  “Over the decade, especially after the start of the pandemic, it has been clearly proven that fintechs and banks have a collaborative relationship rather than a competitive one,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, managing director and chief executive officer at South Indian Bank.  “I feel that fintechs will continue to have the role of an enabler rather than a competitor. Even with banks’ legacy infrastructural gaps, they do have a firmly established long-term client base that is unlikely for fintechs to replace,” Ramakrishnan added.  According to Akhil Handa, chief digital officer at Bank of Baroda, while technological advances are not new to finance, digital innovation has brought major improvements in the connectivity of systems, in computing power and cost, and in newly created and usable data. These improvements have alleviated transaction costs and given rise to new business models and new entrants like fintechs.  “Fintechs have demonstrated that they can transform the financial-landscape, where consumers get to choose from a larger set of options at competitive prices and build efficiency through lower operational costs,” said Handa. “Banks may have lost some customers to mobile fintech applications, but this has also created an opportunity like never before for banking institutions and inspired them to embrace change.”  Also read: Fintechs need to ‘live' compliance, knowing regulations is not enough: Axis Bank MD &amp;amp; CEO Amitabh Chaudhry  Large unbanked population  Another reason why there is a tremendous opportunity for both players to survive in this landscape is the large number of unbanked Indians. Around 200 million Indians are unbanked, according to the Global Findex Database –2021. That’s quite a large number for both fintechs and banks to tap into.  “In India, we have enormous unmet demand for credit and enough space for many players. So, thinking that fintechs are eating into banks’ business is rather odd,” said Sugandh Saxena, chief executive officer at the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE).  Saxena added that most traditional banks are trying to catch up with fintechs, which only pose a threat to the ‘traditional’ way of banking. Banks in India have capital, scale, credibility and a much larger mandate, he added.  Bank of Baroda’s Handa said that while there has been increased competition from fintechs in the last few years in segments like payments and lending, banks have taken on this challenge as an opportunity.  Fintechs, according to Handa, have to an extent inspired banks to make product delivery seamless and on the go. Banks are delivering products with enhanced user experience and have made customers transition back to using the products and services of incumbents, he said. Rather than fear, he feels it is “healthy competition” between two entities striving to constantly push each other to serve their clientele better every day.  Can fintechs replace banks?  For a while back in 2021, the question often asked was: will fintechs be a threat to banks? Today, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has left no one in doubt about the answer, going by the slew of circulars that it has issued to rein in fintechs.    “The RBI seems hell-bent on regulating fintechs through banks or NBFCs (non-banking finance companies), and hence our models will have to evolve around that,” said a fintech founder, on condition of anonymity. “Our wings are clipped, so we have to depend on banks and NBFCs for survival. With the kind of regulations that the RBI has brought in, it is impossible for fintechs to replace banks altogether.”  According to Rajat Deshpande, chief executive officer and co-founder of FinBox, the plan for legacy players—banks and NBFCs—looks like this: improve your technology stack, partner with fintechs where you can’t build it yourself, and convert the entire suite of offerings into a digital-first business where the cost of delivery is lower.  This way, there’s much more potential to increase revenue per customer, said Deshpande. Direct acquisition of customers, added Deshpande, is becoming increasingly expensive and hence eats into margins quickly.  However, some bankers said that while banks’ cost of spending on digital transformation has increased, the costs may be plateauing.  “I think we are plateauing; 50 percent is at an aggregate level. At an aggregate level we are clearly seeing a plateauing of costs already,” said Parag Rao, group head – payments, consumer finance, technology and digital marketing at HDFC Bank at the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar app.  The way forward: collaboration or confrontation?  At least seven bankers and fintechs Moneycontrol spoke to said that collaboration, and not competition, is the way forward. Rather than competing with each other, it would be best for fintechs and banks to identify each other’s strengths and play the market together, added industry players.  “It's no longer going to be an 'us versus them'. Banks and fintechs have both realised that they accomplish more when they are collaborating, instead of competing,” said Srikanth Mopidevi, managing director and head of technology at DBS Bank India. “By working in tandem, banks are able to provide customer-friendly technology, while fintechs benefit from the large-scale network and customer data available with the banks.”  The next few years, Mopidevi said, will see a host of new collaborations expected to further improve the banking experience. Bank-fintech partnerships have especially enabled smaller banks to innovate and become competitive. However, fintechs will complement and enhance the existing banking landscape and not replace it, he added.  HDFC Bank’s Rao concurred with Mopidevi’s view. Rao said that he believes “very strongly” in the partnership philosophy and that the bank is open to more partnerships with fintech players.  Fintech players, too, believe that the partnership model will work well for both sides. “We believe that neo-banks and traditional Banks can work together to increase the size of the pie and play off each other’s strengths,” said Kunal Varma, co-founder and CEO of Freo, a consumer neobank. “This would lead to a win for the consumer, reduction in costs, and rapid market expansion with sustainable profit pools for the industry.”  This trend is currently visible. In September, Axis Bank partnered with fintech firm PayNearby to launch savings and current accounts for last-mile merchants. IDBI Bank has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Vay Network Services as its first fintech partner for digital supply chain finance solutions (e-SCF). There are many such examples.  According to the EY report cited earlier, collaborations between traditional financial services players such as banks with fintech startups is “business as usual” now and enabled by the proliferation of APIs (application programming interfaces, which allow myriad software types to communicate with each other) and data sharing norms.  With limited new licences, fintech startups only have the partnership route to go to market, and that is being welcomed by banks, the report said.

However, the central bank decided to lower its FY23 real GDP growth estimate to seven percent from 7.2 percent earlier, which was lower than the S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings' 7.3 percent projection but same as that of Fitch Ratings.  &quot;The MPC delivered rate hike in line with expectations. At this point, we still think that the RBI would not go too restrictive and terminal rate could hover near estimated real rates, implying not more than 100 bp hikes ahead, including today's decision. However, the extent of global disruption will remain key to the RBI’s reaction function ahead,&quot; Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Emkay Global Financial Services, said.

Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital  Kotak Mahindra Bank: Accumulate | LTP: Rs 1,765.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,580 | Target: Rs 1,980 | Return: 12  On long term charts, Kotak Mahindra Bank is moving in a range of Rs 1,650 – 2,000 since last 1.5 years.  After nearly 26 percent correction from life-high levels of Rs 2,253, Kotak Mahindra Bank took support at its 50 percent retracement level (Rs 1,625) and the stock has posted a sharp bounce till the Rs 2,000 mark before entering corrective phase again.  On the weekly charts, the stock has formed Double Bottom price pattern at Rs 1,650 levels and also the CIP (change in polarity) pattern has been seen at Rs 1,650 – 1,700 levels which provides solid support for the stock near that zone for the medium to long term.  The RSI (relative strength index) indicator on weekly time frames is moving in a range of 40 - 60 for the last one year which indicates range-bound movements of the stock.  Going ahead we can expect the stock price will continue to move in the same range in the medium term so one can accumulate the stock near Rs 1,700 – Rs 1,650 for upside potential of Rs 1,980 mark.  We recommend following a stop-loss of Rs 1,580 for this trade on a closing basis.    Bank of Baroda: Accumulate | LTP: Rs 127.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 95 | Target: Rs 156 | Return: 22 percent  Bank of Baroda has been moving in a strong uptrend on monthly charts with higher highs and higher lows formation since May 2020.  The stock has formed a strong base at Rs 95 levels with Double Bottom formation on the weekly charts and moved up near its 52-week high indicating existence of a strong uptrend in the medium to long term.  For the last couple of weeks, the stock has been facing strong resistance at Rs 144 levels which is its 2019 high levels and has moved in a corrective phase. However, the stock has immediate strong support at Rs 117 – Rs 113 zone where it formed CIP (change in polarity) formation.  The RSI indicator on the weekly charts is sustaining above the 55 mark indicating positive momentum in prices.  Going ahead, we expect the prices may dip till Rs 117 - Rs 113 levels. So we recommend accumulating the stock at Rs 117 – Rs 113 levels for upside potential of Rs 143 followed by Rs 156 levels.  We advise a stop-loss of Rs 95 for the trade on a closing basis.    Federal Bank: Accumulate | LTP: Rs 113 | Stop-Loss: Rs 95 | Target: Rs 142 | Return: 26 percent  On the monthly charts, Federal Bank is outperforming the broader market, maintaining higher top higher bottom formation and forming a fresh life-time high of Rs 129.55 levels which shows strong positive undertone of the stock.  On the weekly charts, the stock has posted a Symmetrical Triangle pattern breakout with volume confirmation and currently has been in a corrective phase for the last couple of weeks. However, the stock is still sustaining above its 20-week SMA (Rs 103) indicating positive strength in the medium to long term.  The RSI indicator on the weekly &amp;amp; monthly charts is sustaining above the 55 mark which shows positive momentum of the stock.  In the coming future, we can expect the stock may correct till Rs 108 – Rs 103 levels where one can get good buying opportunity in the stock for an upside potential of Rs 129 followed by Rs 143 levels.  We recommend stop-loss for the trade at Rs 95 on a closing basis.    Expert: Vaishali Parekh, Vice President - Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher  Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 7,104.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,700 | Target: Rs 8,000-8,200 | Return: 13-15 percent  The stock has overall been in a positive trend moving above the significant 200-day moving average (DMA) zone of Rs 6,780 levels with a consolidation phase witnessed recently moving between the range of Rs 7,100 and Rs 7,600 levels but medium-term bias remains positive.  We anticipate a revival from Rs 7,000 levels which is the support zone of the channel pattern on the daily chart with major support lying near the 200 DMA level of Rs 6,750.  Our view gets negated only in case a breach below the 200DMA level is established and till then the overall trend remains positive. The stock has immense potential to rise further and one can buy and accumulate this stock for an upside target of Rs 8,000-8,200 keeping the stop-loss of Rs 6,700.    State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 521.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 490 | Target: Rs 580-620 | Return: 11-19 percent  The stock has indicated a breakout recently above Rs 545 levels and has strengthened the trend but with a correction has again slipped inside the channel with bias still remaining strong.  The strong support visible is near the 200 DMA level of Rs 500 where we anticipate a revival and can move ahead for another fresh upward move to breach the recent peak level.  With the chart overall looking good, we suggest buying and accumulating the stock at every decline till Rs 505 levels and expect it to rise thereafter for upward targets of Rs 580-620 while keeping a stop-loss at Rs 490.    Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 719 | Stop-Loss: Rs 680 | Target: Rs 765 | Return: 6 percent  Axis Bank has witnessed a very sharp correction of 13 percent in the last week. Since then the stock has been consolidating between Rs 710-730 and it has made a solid base near Rs 710 levels.  On a daily scale, the said counter has formed a Doji like structure near the support zone and daily RSI (relative strength index) has formed an impulsive structure which is adding more confirmation for upside in coming days. One can buy between Rs 705-710 with upside seen till Rs 765 with credible support seen at Rs 680.    Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 402.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 375 | Target: Rs 440 | Return: 9 percent  What a classic setup we are having in Tata Motors, precise bullish BAT pattern (note: it is one of the most powerful patterns among entire harmonic arsenal) which got completed near 0.886 ratio on the daily chart with potential reversal zone of Rs 390-395.  In the current scenario, daily RSI (relative strength index) has a complex structure near the oversold zone which is also complemented by over-stretched daily MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) hinting at early reversal in counter.  One can buy between Rs 393-396 with upside seen till Rs 440 with credible support seen at Rs 375.    Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,033.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 970 | Target: Rs 1,145 | Return: 11 percent  The free fall that started from November 2021 till June 2022 resulted in a 43 percent decline in price. On a weekly scale the counter has formed a bullish shark with potential reversal zone of Rs 960-990 along with double bottom near mentioned PRZ (potential reversal zone) which is adding more confirmation for early reversal in the said counter.  From an indicator perspective, weekly RSI (relative strength index) has formed a complex structure along with the MACD bullish cross which further confirms upside in the counter.  One can buy in small tranches at current levels and buy another tranche at around Rs 1,010 levels (if again tested). Upside is expected till Rs 1,145 and support is seen around Rs 970.    Expert: Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities  M&amp;amp;M Financial Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 181.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 169 | Target: Rs 210 | Return: 15 percent  The stock has been consolidating around the crucial support of 200DMA after it corrected from Rs 235 to Rs 176 in quick sessions. The RSI has entered into an oversold zone which may induce a recovery over the short term.  A decisive move above Rs 185 may induce a strong rally towards Rs 210.    Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 402.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 368 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 17 percent  The stock corrected sharply on the daily timeframe from Rs 490 levels to Rs 390 levels.

Samsung India Senior Vice President for Mobile Business Raju Pullan said the company has focussed on making purchases affordable and it has seen about three times growth in transactions happening through Samsung Finance plus for buying its product. ”We believe that consumer expectations in India are getting upscaled. It was visible in our latest Galaxy series Z Fold 4 and Flip 4. We will end up seeing this year almost 2X growth over last year on the new launches. It’s really important to actually create various new platforms so that consumers are able to acquire the Samsung products across price points and upgrade themselves to newer technologies,” Pullan said. He said that the company has 30 million registered users of Samsung Pay, which was launched in 2017. Samsung Finance plus provides finance options to consumers who are availing credit for the first time. ”We are seeing a tremendous response not only in tier 2 and 3 markets but the rural market as well. Last year, we used to do business of about Rs 250 crore per month on the Samsung Finance plus. Almost 50 per cent of users were new to credit consumers.&quot; ”This year as we speak, we are averaging at Rs 700 crore on transactions per month. This means that if we provide the right platforms to customers to upgrade, they will get on to it. That’s the genesis of our partnership with Axis Bank along with Visa,” Pullan said. The company claims to have sold over 12 lakh Galaxy smartphones worth more than Rs 1,000 crore on the first day of online festive sales at Amazon and Flipkart.

axis,2022-09-21T14:47:59+05:30,Mansi Verma," Fintechs need to ‘live' compliance, knowing regulations is not enough: Axis Bank MD &amp; CEO Amitabh...","Amitabh Chaudhry, MD &amp; CEO of Axis Bank, added that while fintechs agree they understand the meaning of the word ‘compliance’, it is time they consciously start making it a part of their business model","Fintechs have a tendency to keep doing what they want to and hoping the regulator does not get involved, said Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry.  “That tendency has to change. Fintechs have to think of compliance much earlier than they are currently,” Chaudhry said on Wednesday, September 21, speaking at the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai.  Chaudhry added that while fintechs agree they understand the meaning of the word “compliance”, it is time they consciously start making it a part of their business model.  “If you read the tea leaves, the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) gives enough hints. Businesses will suffer if they don’t pay heed,” he said.  The Axis Bank chief was in conversation with Razorpay co-founder and CEO Harshil Mathur talking about fintechs and regulations.  Chaudhry pointed out that he has seen a lot of activity in the regulation in the fintech space recently.  “It has meant that people have had to go back to the drawing board and relook at models. More clarity will emerge in 18-24 months,” he said, referring to fintechs like Slice, Uni, LazyPay and BharatPe, whose models of enabling lending through prepaid cards and wallets will not be allowed as per RBI norms.  On August 10, the RBI approved 12 guidelines on digital lending to be implemented immediately, largely focusing on customer safety and emphasising on transparent reporting of lending activities to credit rating agencies.  The RBI’s norms on digital lending stated that “registered entities shall ensure that in no case, disbursal is made to a third-party account, including the accounts of loan service providers (LSPs) and their digital lending apps (DLAs), except as provided for in these guidelines”.  The norm meant that loans cannot pass through prepaid payment instruments (PPIs). This was a second blow to fintechs with PPI-led lending models after the RBI said on June 20 that loading of credit lines into PPIs is prohibited.  The central bank formally notified the norms on September 2, adding that fintechs have time until November 20 to adhere to the new guidelines.  At the event, Chaudhry added that the fintech and banking space should be prepared for regulation evolution and new norms to be rolled out. “For companies in this business, it is not a question about waiting for the next evolution to come but to anticipate what is coming and change their business models in advance,” Chaudhary added.  Moneycontrol had reported on August 18 that the government of Mauritius-promoted SBM Bank India had sent a communication to its fintech partners Slice, Uni and PayU’s LazyPay saying it is pausing the on-boarding of new customers after the RBI approved the first set of guidelines on digital lending on August 10.  Axis Bank is an investor in Slice, which was disbursing around 300,000 new prepaid cards per month in partnership with SBM Bank India before the norms kicked in. The Tiger Global-backed startup achieved $1 billion in valuation in November 2021 on the back of this growth.  Due to the change in norms, some of the options these companies are now considering include moving from prepaid cards to co-branded credit cards or introducing a bank account from which loans can be loaded onto prepaid cards, which will align with regulations. For this, these fintechs are said to be in talks with multiple large banks, according to sources.  On the side-lines, Chaudhry told Moneycontrol that Axis Bank is open to partnering with these fintechs, but did not divulge any further details.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/fintechs-need-to-live-regulations-knowing-regulations-is-not-enough-axis-bank-md-ceo-amitabh-chaudhry-9209911.html
axis,2022-09-19T06:17:58+05:30,Sameet Chavan,"Hot Stocks | Here's why you should bet on United Spirits, Axis Bank","The entire banking space has been on a buying spree since last couple of months. In fact, the banking index managed to clock fresh highs this week and ‘Axis Bank’ is one of the major contributors in the rally.","We had a pleasant start on September 12 taking the US market's previous Friday's rally into consideration. We challenged 18,000 but failed to sustain on the same day itself. But since it was merely a formality, the index opened beyond this psychological level on the following day. In this process, the Nifty registered a highest close in the last eight months. Everything looked hunky dory as we were poised to make a move towards previous highs.  But the US markets tumbled suddenly on Tuesday on the back of rising inflation print. This resulted in a massive gap-down. Our markets, however, managed to weather the storm. We defended key levels and traded with a positive bias for couple of trading sessions. However, the Friday's session turned out to be a nightmare as we witnessed a sustained selling throughout the session to conclude the week with 1.70 percent cut, marginally above 17,500.  Generally, we say ‘All’s well that ends well’ but this time it’s the exact opposite. We had a perfect start of the week, but the end was certainly not everyone would have wished for. The broader structure remains bullish but with Nifty closing convincingly below 17,600 has dented the intermediate structure for sure.  Pricewise, it resembles a ‘Head and Shoulder’ pattern on daily time frame chart, which does not augur well for the bulls. If this pattern proves its significance, we may see further correction towards 17,200 – 17,000 in the coming week. But as of now, we do not want to fall into this camp. We would rather reassess the situation in the first half of the coming week.  As far as support is concerned, 17,400 we are seeing as a key support. The moment we see Nifty sliding below it, we may see correction getting extended in the market. On the flipside, if Nifty has to find its mojo back, it needs to go beyond Friday's high of 17,820 on a closing basis. So meanwhile, any minor bounce back towards 17,650 – 17,750 should ideally be used to exit longs.  After Friday's close, we would like to adopt a wait and watch approach and let's see how global market performs over the weekend.  Traders are advised not to get intimidated by Friday's correction, rather keep a close tab on above mentioned scenarios. Also, one should avoid trading aggressively till the time market stabilizes from this turbulence.  Sectorally, the recent leader, Bank Nifty is placed at an interesting juncture. Hopefully, it manages to lift the overall sentiments in the coming week.  Here are two buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  United Spirits: Buy | LTP: Rs 838.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 807 | Target: Rs 890 | Return: 6 percent  This has been our preferred bet of late from the liquor space. If we take a glance at the daily time frame chart, we can see nice base formation around Rs 760 odd levels. This was followed by small but steady up moves in regular intervals.  In the week gone by, stock prices managed to confirm yet another breakout from the long multi-month trend line. This coincided with traversing of ‘200-day SMA' (simple moving average) as well around Rs 838.  Hence, although stock prices retraced a bit on Friday in tandem with broader market sell off, we recommend buying for a near term target of Rs 890. Traders can participate by following strict stop-loss at Rs 807.    Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 789.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 767 | Target: Rs 825 | Return: 4.5 percent  The entire banking space has been on a buying spree since last couple of months. In fact, the banking index managed to clock fresh highs this week and ‘Axis Bank’ is one of the major contributors in the rally.  In last couple of sessions, we witnessed mild profit booking in this stock after surpassing Rs 800 mark. However, the broader structure looks quite strong and on Friday, stock prices recovered after retesting the previous breakout points.  Considering the higher high higher bottom cycle, traders are advised to buy for a near term target of Rs 825. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 767.

Here's why","On the daily timeframe, CDSL prices have given a breakout from the Rounding Bottom pattern, indicated beginning of trend on the upside. The breakout was confirmed by high volumes.","On the monthly chart, the Nifty is trading in its prior month range which points to a mixed undertone in the index.  On the weekly chart, the prices have taken resistance from the downward slopping trend line for the fourth time since October 2021 and is maintaining a higher-high, higher-low formation.  Prices on the daily time frame have sustained above the 20-day SMA (simple moving average), which was acting as a variable support to the prices.  RSI plotted on the daily and the weekly timeframe is above 50, which reflects strong momentum in the index.  The index has its immediate support placed at the level of 17,650 (20 days SMA). On the other hand, the resistance is placed at the level of 17,992 (swing high) followed by 18,250 (key resistance).  Looking at the overall chart pattern, we feel that the overall trend is positive and the index may attempt to go higher till the level of 17,992 and 18,250 level. Our bullish view would be negated if we see prices sustaining below the level of 17,350.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  Tata Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 244.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 230 | Target: Rs 280 | Return: 14 percent  Tata Power has shown a bounce from the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of prior advance from level Rs 27 (May 2020) till Rs 298 (April, 2022).

The Bollinger Band on the daily timeframe have started to expand with volume participation indicates that the volatility in the underlying is increasing for upside move.  RSI (relative strength index) plotted on weekly and daily timeframe have sustained above 50 mark which tells that the prices are in strong momentum.  We recommend to buy this stock for the target of Rs 280 with stop-loss at the level of Rs 230 on the Closing basis.    Central Depository Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,420.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,250 | Target: Rs 1,737 | Return: 22 percent  CDSL is currently trading within 20 percent of its all-time high level, which tells that the stock is in a strong momentum already.  On the daily timeframe, prices have given a breakout from the Rounding Bottom pattern, indicated beginning of trend on the upside. The breakout was confirmed by high volumes.  RSI plotted on the weekly time frame is rising higher with the prices which again confirms the rising momentum in the counter.  Going ahead we expect the prices to go higher till its record high level which is Rs 1,737 where the stop-loss must be Rs 1,250 on the closing basis.    Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 779.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 712 | Target: Rs 870 | Return: 11 percent  On the weekly timeframe we can spot that prices have shown a bounce from crucial support of Rs 630 level.  On the daily timeframe prices after a breakout from double bottom pattern on July 18, 2022 which indicated a beginning of trend on the upside.  Bollinger band plotted on the daily timeframe have started to expand which points towards the rising volatility of the prices for an up move.  RSI plotted on the Weekly timeframe have shown a breakout reflecting the rising momentum in the prices.

This, coupled with lower LLP, led to a 14% beat on PAT at Rs41.2bn (up 91% yoy) despite elevated opex (CI ratio: 52%; cost-asset: 2.4%). The bank had withdrawn near-term cost guidance in Q4 citing volatility, but has now guided for a medium-term cost-to-asset ratio of 2%, driven by better productivity. Credit growth was slow at 14% yoy/down 1% qoq vs. much higher growth for peers (ICICI/HDFCB: 22%), mainly due to declines in corporate/overseas/SME books. However, retail growth remained healthy at 25% yoy/3% qoq, with strong growth in unsecured loans, but mortgage growth was surprisingly slower than peers. Better portfolio mix/asset repricing led to a 11bps qoq improvement in NIMs to 3.6%. Axis has retained NIM guidance at 3.7-3.8% for the next 8-10 quarters on better portfolio mix and run-down in RIDF bonds. Despite lower slippages at Rs37bn/2.4% of loans, the GNPA ratio was largely flat at 2.8% due to slow growth. The bank carries a healthy specific PCR of 77%/Covid provisions at 0.7% of loans, which should keep LLP under check. We expect the bank’s RoA/RoE to improve to 1.6%/16% by FY25E - up from 1.2%/12% in FY22. That said, Citi portfolio acquisition calls for shoring up capital levels and could lead to a dilution in RoEs.

Axis Bank on July 25 reported a 91 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 4,125 crore for the quarter ended June, topping analysts' expectations of Rs 3,597.7 crore.  Despite robust net profit growth, the operating profit fell five percent from a year ago owing to operating expenses rising 34 percent and treasury losses. Core operating profit excluding trading income grew 17 percent year-on-year and five percent sequentially, driven by resilient fee income growth.  The bank suffered a mark-to-market hit of Rs 1,200 crore that resulted in a trading loss of Rs 667 crore. &quot;This is mainly from our corporate bond book. Here, the securities are rated A (-) and above. We do not expect any economic loss on this book,&quot; said Rajiv Anand, deputy managing director.  The private sector lender reported a 21 percent rise in net interest income to Rs 9,384 crore, exceeding Street's estimate of Rs 9,186.6 crore, aided by robust loan growth of 14 percent and an improvement in net interest margin to 3.60 percent.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after earnings:  Sharekhan  Axis Bank is looking for a sustainable growth path in terms of advances growth led by retail, SME, and mid-corporate segments in a granular manner along with focus on mobilisation of low-cost granular liability and higher spending on tech.  New digital product initiatives, both in assets and liability segments, are growing well as reflected in strong acquisition growth.  With high PCR and strong balance sheet, the bank can absorb shocks from any unanticipated future risk. We believe its valuations are reasonable, given structural improvement visible in the franchise.  Motilal Oswal  Axis Bank delivered strong earnings, driven by a significant decline in provisions and margin expansion, even as opex continues to remain elevated. Business growth was muted clocking a sequential decline.  Asset quality continues to improve aided by a moderation in slippages and healthy recoveries and upgrades. Restructured book moderated further, while a higher provisioning buffer provides comfort.  We expect slippages to remain in control, enabling a sustained improvement in credit costs, though improvement in margin and cost ratios will be key factors to watch out for.  We expect Axis Bank to deliver a FY24 RoA/RoE (return on asset/equity) of 1.6/16.7 percent. We maintain our buy rating with a target price of Rs 875 per share.  CLSA  We maintain a buy rating on the stock and raise the target to Rs 975.  It was a strong quarter with its net interest income beat offsetting higher opex. Low credit costs offset Rs 600 crore in bond losses.  The bank looks likely to deliver well on its margin guidance.  Morgan Stanley  We keep an overweight rating on the Axis Bank with a target of Rs 910 per share as the profit was 13% above estimate, helped by higher than expected revenue.  The core PPoP (pre-provision operating profit) was four percent above our estimates.  The RoE of 16 percent by FY25 stays on track.  JPMorgan  We keep a neutral rating on the stock and cut the target price to Rs 780 from Rs 880.  Loan growth disappoints with one percent sequential fall while retail does better with corporate being slower.  Net interest margin improvement guidance has been maintained. The RoA was 1.4 percent, remaining 60 basis points lower than larger peers.  Jefferies  We maintain a buy rating on the stock and cut the target price to Rs 1,010 from Rs 1,050.  The company reported better operating results and can bridge valuation gap.  The profit was ahead of estimate aided by lower credit cost and better topline, while slippages stayed low and helped keep credit cost at marginal level.  The valuation gap with ICICI Bank can narrow a bit from 35-40 percent now.  Macquarie  We maintain a neutral rating on the stock with a target of Rs 790.  The net interest margin has improved while loan growth and cost ratios lag behind peers.  We remain concerned on weak retail term deposit growth. The funding franchise continues to be weaker than larger peers.  The focus on margin in a tough quarter was a good move, but loan growth is important too. The valuations are looking reasonable at current levels.  At 09:17 hours, Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 717.50, down Rs 10.70 or 1.47 percent on the BSE.

An average of estimates from eight brokerages polled by Moneycontrol had expected Axis Bank to report a 66.6 percent rise in net profit YoY to Rs 3,597.7 crore. Here are the five takeaways from the private lender's Q1FY23 earnings:  1 Strong net profit  The bank’s standalone profit after tax grew to Rs 4,125 crore in the April-June quarter, up from Rs 2,160 crore in the same quarter of the previous financial year.

axis,2022-07-25T17:35:54+05:30,Siddhi Nayak,Explained | Why are banks’ CD rates rising? Five key questions answered,"HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Canara Bank on July 22 issued near-three month CDs at a coupon of 5.60 percent, 5.62 percent and 5.52 percent, respectively, according to NSE data","Rates on certificates of deposit (CD), short-term debt paper issued by banks, have increased of late amid the rate tightening cycle of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Canara Bank on July 22 issued near-three-month CDs at a coupon of 5.60 percent, 5.62 percent and 5.52 percent, respectively, according to National Stock Exchange (NSE) data.  Almost a month back, rates for similar tenure CDs of HDFC Bank and Axis Bank stood at 5.28 percent each. Canara Bank, on June 15, too had issued over three-month CDs at 5.41 percent, according to the data.  The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) hiked rates by a total of 90 basis points in May and June to arrest rising price pressures in the economy. One basis point equals one hundredth of a percentage point.  What are CDs?  CDs are a money market instrument and are typically issued by scheduled commercial banks and select financial institutions permitted by the RBI. For banks, the maturity period of a CD should be between 7 days and one year. CD rates are sensitive to interest-rate movements.  Why are CD rates rising?  According to money market participants, the primary reason for the rise in CD rates is the credit off-take in the economy and the fact that RBI is slowly withdrawing a liquidity surplus from the banking system.  Demand for credit is rising which, coupled with the dwindling liquidity surplus in the banking system, has increased the need for banks to issue these money market instruments.    Typically, while investing in CDs, investors demand a spread or a premium over government-issued Treasury Bill or T-Bill rates. On July 20, the government’s three-month T-Bill was sold at a cut-off yield of 5.40 percent, up from 5.09 percent a month ago.  “Investors preferred treasury bills over bank CDs as the three-month treasury bills are trading around 5.40 percent and one-year treasury bills are trading around 6.20 percent,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.  “Hence, being a capital market instrument, banks have to price their CDs over Treasury Bills to get enough investor demand.”  Srinivasan expects top state-run bank CDs to continue to trade with a spread of at least 20 to 50 basis points over T-Bill rates.  Will the trend continue?   Yes. Money market experts said CD rates are likely to edge higher as the rate hike cycle becomes more entrenched and as the RBI steps up liquidity absorption to combat inflationary pressures in the economy. The pace could accelerate if the RBI tightens monetary policy at a faster-than-expected pace.  The RBI’s actions directly influence the direction of short-term consumer debt and deposit rates. So with multiple rate hikes seen in what remains of 2022, experts see CD rates rising further. Already, the net liquidity absorbed by the RBI as of July 24 was Rs 1.24 lakh crore, down from Rs 3.29 lakh crore on June 8, according to central bank data. This indicates that surplus liquidity has fallen sharply since the last monetary policy decision.  “Looking at the global situation, RBI is concerned with the rising inflation and depreciating rupee,” said Umesh Tulsyan, managing director at Sovereign Global Markets. “There is no other option with RBI than increasing the repo rate to suck the liquidity from the market. Conclusively, we may see this trend to further continue in the coming next year till the time inflation is not combated.”  How many rate hikes are factored in?  Money market experts said the repo rate is expected to be at 5.75 percent by December, up from 4.90 percent currently. Accordingly, CD rates could move higher. Experts said the pace of the increase in CD rates could reduce now that most of the negatives are already factored into prices.  “Yields in money market segments have corrected after sharp rate hikes and withdrawal of liquidity from the system,” said Sanjay Pawar, fund manager – fixed income, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management. “Repo rate hikes are likely in the immediate future; however the market has discounted the rate hikes in advance.”  Sovereign Global Markets’ Tulsyan added that T-Bill rates are also expected to go up assuming market borrowings increase. The extent of rate hikes priced in for the next one year is almost 100 basis points, he said.  Will CD issuances increase?  As the economic recovery gains momentum and rate hikes increase, bankers and money market experts expect CD issuances to rise. That should increase supply of debt paper and lead to an uptick in rates.  “As credit off-take continues in double digits and deposit rate doesn't increase in tandem, CD issuance will increase and so (will) the spreads,” LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management’s Pawar said.  Pawar pointed out that total outstanding CDs have increased to Rs 2.35 lakh crores versus an outstanding of Rs 1.81 lakh crores as of March-end.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/explained-why-are-banks-cd-rates-rising-five-key-questions-answered-8884701.html

Also, analysts and investors will await the lender’s commentary on loan growth and asset quality.","Axis Bank is expected to report strong growth in its net profit as well as topline aided by improvement in asset quality and a conducive environment for credit offtake in the economy.  The private sector bank is likely to report a 66.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit to Rs 3,597.7 crore for the quarter ended June, according to an average of estimates from eight brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.  The lender will report its June quarter earnings on July 25.  The sharp rise in profit will be aided by a near-70-percent on-year decline in provisions in the quarter to Rs 997 crore as the lender continues to see improvement in its asset quality. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects the lender’s gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio to come in at 2.7 percent compared to 2.8 percent in the previous quarter.  Kotak Institutional Equities believes slippages in the quarter will come in at around 2 percent of the lender’s advances book or Rs 3,500 crore for the reported quarter. “Expect strong commentary on asset quality performance and we see an improvement in NPL ratios aided by stronger recovery,” Kotak Equities said in a preview note.    That said, on a sequential basis, Axis Bank’s net profit is expected to decline 12.6 percent because of heavy losses in the treasury department of the bank. The private sector lender will report treasury losses worth Rs 2,070 crore for the reporting quarter due to sharp rise domestic government bond yields.  Government bond yields jumped more than 60 basis points (bps) in the June quarter on the back of a 90-bps hike in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to tame multi-year retail inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index. Bond prices move in opposite direction to their yield.  The high treasury losses will also weigh on the operating performance of the lender as analysts expect pre-provision operating profit to slide 1 percent on-year, and 5.3 percent on-quarter, to Rs 6,123.3 crore in the reporting quarter.  The topline performance of Axis Bank will be strong, as net interest income is expected to grow 18.4 percent on YoY basis to Rs 9,186.6 crore, aided by healthy growth in advances. Loans are likely to grow north of 18 percent on-year in the reported quarter, led by the retail loan portfolio.  “Advances are expected to grow by 19 percent YoY with a revival of the economy and improvement in asset quality,” brokerage firm Ashika Institutional Equities said in a note.  Besides the lender’s June quarter results, analysts and investors will await the company’s commentary on loan growth and asset quality. “Progress of the Citibank portfolio and direction of operating profit growth will be a key discussion area for the quarter,” Kotak Equities said.

axis,2022-07-07T17:52:49+05:30,Piyush Shukla," Interview: Citi deal on track, will grow cards portfolio aggressively in FY23, says Axis Bank executive...","Some new partnerships between Axis Bank and fintechs may take shape due to RBI’s recent clarification on loading credit lines on wallets, Moghe said.","The $1.6-billion deal made by Axis Bank to acquire the consumer business portfolio of Citibank India on March 30 is on track and awaiting regulatory approvals, Axis Bank president and head of cards and payments Sanjeev Moghe told Moneycontrol in an interaction Thursday, July 7.  “The deal is on the right track, we are waiting for regulatory approvals, and the work will pick pace further post that but right now it is all on track,” Moghe said.  Citibank India and Axis Bank’s credit card portfolio is stable with low single-digit bad loans, Moghe said, adding that Citibank India is not witnessing any extraordinary attrition among employees and is being able to hold on to and attract more high net-worth individuals (HNI) as customers.  Edited excerpts:  Q: Your credit card portfolio grew at the fastest pace during January-March. What will be the growth strategy in the current fiscal?  A: We have our partnerships which have started giving us results. For example, we launched (a card in a tie-up with) Flipkart three years back and are witnessing very interesting results. The partnership with Google has taken on some momentum, we launched with Airtel Payments Bank in February, and all of these are scaling up now. Flipkart is very substantial where we have crossed 2.5 million cards.  The second part is, the organic business also has solid momentum because we have our learnings from the Covid-19 pandemic and as we scale up post that, my sense is this growth is going to continue. There will be some upset but in the next two quarters, Q1 (April-June) and Q2 (July-September) we should be around a million (issuance of 1 million credit cards), and scale up further from Q3 (October-December) onwards.  We started the year at total CIF (cards in force) of 9 million. The RBI (Reserve Bank of India) has recently issued guidelines on card closure but if we keep that aside for a minute, I will envisage overall CIF at the end of year (March 31, 2023) at close to 12 million cards... I think these numbers are very strong. Obviously, at some point, by December or March, when the Citi portfolio gets added, it will be another 2.5 million cards.  Q: How is the Citi deal shaping up?  A: The deal is on the right track, we are waiting for regulatory approvals, and the work will pick pace further post that but right now it is all on track. We have started work with them (Citibank India) but this is going to take some time but we are on track, as per our schedule.  Q: Is the bank being able to hold on to HNI customers of Citibank India and attract similar clients?  A: Citibank India customers’ international spends are higher than the market and Axis Bank, that is likely to continue purely because of the profile that Citibank has. We believed that if we have to make our portfolio more affluent, if we buy them, it adds a lot of value to Axis Bank, and that point holds.  Is Citibank witnessing any undue or very extraordinary attrition rates in terms of customers? No. We have not seen anything out of the ordinary in the Citibank portfolio. That is why the business momentum on their side is good and on our side as well. When you combine the entities, they are formidable and will become very formidable in the market…  Q: Are you witnessing higher attrition in the Citibank India team?  A: From what we are seeing on the cards portfolio, we are pretty confident of delivering value on the deal that we have made. I do not see a challenge on that.  Employee attrition and those things are fine, overall in the market, too, attrition is happening. Those things will be taken care of as part of overall merger exercise...  Q: Canara Bank is planning to launch a credit card subsidiary and other lenders like HDFC Bank are chasing growth aggressively in the space. How will you beat the competition?  A: The balance sheet of banks is clean. It got cleaned up a couple of years back and during the Covid-19 pandemic phase. That means that risk is pretty low right now. When risk is low you can obviously grow your business that much more…  We are confident about the growth because we have two engines running right now. One is organic bank channels and second we have built through partnerships. We have multiple large partnerships including Flipkart, LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India), Google, Airtel, Vistara—these are big names. These are big partnerships, and we anticipate some more partnerships to fructify through the year itself. With that the growth momentum will be solid. It is also possible that other lenders will also look at growth. That is fine, we have our strategy in place. Our strategies are dependent not just on top six-eight markets, we have very deep acquisition capabilities…  Q: Are there any acquisitions planned for this fiscal?  A: Nothing in the pipeline. Citi is what we have, we will absorb and deliver on that and if anything is there, it is in the future.  Our rank in credit card space is presently number 4. I do not see our rank improving to number 2 or 3 in the next 12-18 months because that gap if fairly wide.  What I do anticipate is that the gap between us and the others will close, the gap between number 4 and 3 and 2. Partly because of the way Axis Bank will grow, and because Citibank India (credit cards) will come close to reporting by the end of year…  Q: How many partners are you looking to get on board your bank for co-branded cards?  A: Credit card launches will continue. We will not do 8-10 launches, but you will expect some news throughout the year—I cannot talk too much because these are currently being worked on. These launches will happen in Q3, Q4.  Q: How is the asset quality of Axis Bank and Citibank India’s credit card portfolio?  A: It is very clean, NPAs (non-performing assets) are in lower single digits.  Q: Will it continue to be stable?  A: It will be in the lower single digit territory.  Q: Is the RBI diktat to fintechs that they cannot load credit lines into wallets a good move for regulated banks?  A: Lot of people are asking whether it is bad for PPIs (prepaid payment instruments) or bad for NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) and good for banks, etc. I do not view regulations from that lens. The way to look at the regulation is obviously there is some ambiguity which was being used and the RBI has clarified that certain things are not allowed.  Does it impact people who were using ambiguities? Yes it does.  Some of these players will now have to look at alternative solutions. What are the solutions? Whether they talk to banks for partnerships, we will wait and see what happens from here onwards.  Q: Will you continue partnering with fintechs?  A: Yes, we will talk to them. Whatever works out and since we have clear principles that we follow, if it meets those principles, we will partner with some of them…  Q: Will your partnership with Freecharge and the buy now, pay later (BNPL) product continue?  A: BNPL will continue, there is no problem with BNPL.  Unfortunately, people are conflating these guidelines which really say that you cannot load a credit line through PPIs … Freecharge has a product, their product will continue and it is actually doing quite well... The partnership is going well, it will continue to do well and there is no impact of the regulatory guidelines on Freecharge’s BNPL product. People are mixing two issues there.  Q: Should fintechs be regulated more?  A: Whenever the regulatory landscape is clarified, there will be an impact on people who would have interpreted it differently. If they were doing something that was not allowed, it would have to be stopped. If some other aspect is clarified, for example on interest rates, there will be an impact.  As there will be an impact, there will be a reaction… These things will happen at all points of time. We are very focused on the ground on partnerships and organic strategy. These partnerships may come out of our normal discussions, and may also arise as an impact of some of these regulatory changes.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/interview-citi-deal-on-track-will-grow-cards-portfolio-aggressively-in-fy23-says-axis-bank-executive-moghe-8793671.html

Share of retail loans has increased from 45% in FY2017 to 57% in FY2022. Retail, SME, and mid-corporate loans remain key focused segments and these segments are growing at a healthy pace in a granular manner. Gross impaired loans have improved sharply from 7.3% in FY2019 to 3.9% in FY2022. Risk weighted assets as a percentage to advances stands at 101% in FY2022 versus 117 % in FY2019. Improvement in RWA to advances is reflecting higher-rated and less risky loans are underwritten. Overall underwriting practices, particularly in wholesale banking, have also improved significantly. With structural improvement in business franchise and higher provision buffers in place, we expect asset-quality challenges to be largely behind for the bank and expect credit cost to normalise going forward.  Outlook At the CMP, the bank trades at 1.3x and 1.1x its FY2023E/FY2024E core ABV, offering attractive risk reward. We maintain Buy with a PT of Rs. 940.

axis,2022-06-18T13:44:31+05:30,PTI,"Moody's upgrades baseline credit assessments of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank",The global rating agency has upgraded the baseline credit assessments (BCAs) to baa3 from ba1. ,"Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded the baseline credit assessments of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, reflecting improvements in credit fundamentals, particularly asset quality. The global rating agency has upgraded the baseline credit assessments (BCAs) to baa3 from ba1. The upgrade of the BCAs does not result in any change in the deposit ratings because these are already at the same level as the India sovereign rating (Baa3 stable), Moody’s said in a statement on Friday. The upgrade of the two banks’ BCAs is driven by improvements in asset quality, capital, and profitability. Their asset quality has seen a significant improvement, with both the gross and net non-performing loans (NPL) ratios declining. ”Credit costs have also reduced at the same time as provision coverage has increased. Lower credit costs have resulted in higher profitability,” it said. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank’s return on assets for the year ending March 2022 was 1.8 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively, compared to an average of 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent over the four years ending March 2020, it said. ICICI Bank’s profitability has also benefited from rising net interest margins as the share of the low margin international business has come down in the last four years, it added. Both lenders have raised equity capital, resulting in significantly higher capital ratios, it said, adding the core equity tier 1 ratios of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at end March 2022 were 17.6 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively, compared to 13.6 per cent and 11.3 per cent at end March 2019. However, it said, Axis Bank’s proposed acquisition of Citigroup Inc’s India consumer assets will result in an approximately 230 bps decline in capital at the bank. As Axis Bank has good access to capital markets, the ratings agency expects the bank to raise capital to maintain its current capital ratios. Axis Bank is targeting to close the acquisition by March 2023.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moodys-upgrades-baseline-credit-assessments-of-icici-bank-axis-bank-8703981.html

These include financial changes in June as well, whereby which the common man is likely feel a his pocket.  The financial changes in June include SBI home loan EMI rate hike, Axis Bank service charge hike, gold hallmark rule amendments and LPG price revisions among others. Since these changes in June are going to affect several citizens in India from Wednesday, it is important to know about them in detail.  Here are the Key Money and Operational Changes that will Come into Effect from June 01, 2022: SBI Home Loan Interest Rate Hike The State Bank of India will increase its home loan rates from June 1, which is today, as it has hiked its external benchmark linked interest rates from the day. SBI has hiked its EBLR rates by 40 basis points by 40 basis points to 7.05 per cent and the Repo-Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) would in turn be revised to 6.65 per cent plus CRP. This means SBI home loan EMIs are set to go up from today, after the Reserve Bank of India hiked its repo rates in May. Hike in Axis Bank Service Charges June financial changes will also affect the pockets of leading private lender Axis Bank customers, as it has announced a host of increased rates on its service charges. Axis Bank has revised its banking and non-banking service charges for customers with savings and salary accounts, including an increase in the service fee per month over non maintenance of minimum account balance and an increase in the monthly average balance requirement. Cost of Cars and Bikes to Increase The government has revised new base premium rates for third party insurance on cars and bikes, which in turn will result in an increase in their rates from Wednesday. This is applicable to private and commercial cars and bikes run on either fuel or electricity, as per a statement by the ministry of road transport and highways.  Before this, these insurance rates were last revised for the financial year 2019-20 and were kept unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Gold Hallmarking Rule Change From June 1 this year, that is, from Wednesday, the rules of gold hallmarking are set to change in the country. According to a notification by the Centre, from June 1, 2022, jewellers can only sell hallmarked gold jewellery in India, irrespective of its purity. This was notified by the nodal agency Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in a notification in the beginning of April this year. LPG Price Hike While the prices of domestic LPG has been changed just last week, the rising crude oil prices and a subsequent inflation is likely to make gas companies to raise LPG rates again next month.

axis,2022-05-23T06:07:09+05:30,Sameet Chavan,"Hot Stocks | Here's why you should bet on Petronet LNG, Axis Bank for short term","Ff global market remains stable, Axis Bank is likely to give decent relief rally in the coming week. We recommend buying for a near term target of Rs 700. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 657.","Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One  We started the proceedings last Monday on a positive note despite sluggish global cues. In an initial hour, the gains extended to move towards 16,000 mark. Similar to recent trends, the profit-booking took place at higher levels to erase all gains around the midsession. Although the market recovered slightly thereafter, the overall movement was quite choppy to conclude the day around 15,850, with nearly four-tenths of a percent gains.  This was followed by a massive relief move last Tuesday, which extended towards 16,400 on the subsequent day. However, the global weakness struck back once again on the weekly expiry session with a huge gap-down to retest 15,800. The market was not done with its twists as Friday's session opened with yet another gap; but this time it was fortunately on the higher side. This pleasant surprise picked up its momentum as the day progressed, to conclude the week convincingly above 16,200 mark.  The second half of the week gone by was full of dramatic twists and turns. Both the counterparties were caught napping in all this but, as we mostly say ‘all's well that ends well’, eventually the bulls turned out to be victorious as they managed to pull the Nifty back inside the safe terrain by gaining over 3 percent from previous week's close.  With reference to previous week's commentary, 15,700 – 15,600 stands to be a very solid support; because it coincides with the '89-EMA' (exponential moving average - 15,658) on weekly chart who has proved its mettle many times over the past many years. Yes we are not completely out of the woods but at least we are well above the crucial support zone.  On the flipside, the cluster of resistance is placed around 16,400 – 16,500 – 16,600 and till the time we do not surpass it convincingly, one should avoid being complacent. At this juncture, we are clearly mirroring US markets' sentiments and hence, if market has to move higher, the global relief is the key.  Let's see how things pan out this week. It would be important to keep a regular tab on global developments and one should certainly be prepared for surprising moves on either side. As far as sectoral participation is concerned, we witnessed some decent relief moves in most of the beaten heavyweight spaces this week.  Also, the broader market has started to show some encouraging signs which, we believe, should do extremely well if the market remains above the psychological support of 16,000.  Here are two buy calls for short term:  Petronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 227.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 217.80 | Target: Rs 245 | Return: 7.5 percent  If we take a glance at the price action for last ten odd months, we can clearly see rangebound movement with slightly negative bias. Stock prices continued with its lower lows lower highs configuration all this while and has faced tremendous resistance around the sturdy wall of '200-day SMA'.  Of late, we witnessed lot of changes structurally as prices managed to turn the tide upwards by confirming 'Higher Highs Higher Lows' and importantly, has managed to finally traverse the '200-SMA' with some authority.  There are no exceptional volumes as such, but are certainly much higher than its previous average daily volumes, which provides credence to the move. Hence, we recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 245. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 217.80.    Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 673.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 657 | Target: Rs 700 | Return: 4 percent  Overall financial space has been one of the worst performing spaces in last couple of months and 'Axis Bank' has certainly contributed in it to the fullest. After witnessing a 20 percent price correction from recent highs, the stock prices finally saw some respite around the multi-month supports of Rs 640 – 630.  On last Friday, we could see first sign of strength after sustaining beyond the '5-day EMA' along with positive crossover in 'RSI-Smoothened' oscillator from its deeply oversold territory.  Hence, if global market remains stable, this stock is likely to give decent relief rally in the coming week. We recommend buying for a near term target of Rs 700. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 657.

Going ahead, the bank plans to expand the portfolio, the official said, adding that the impending entry of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in the space is not a cause for worry.  “What we have seen is the impact of Covid waves one and two. But since then, whether you track it by entry rates (customers going delinquent for the first time) or by early delinquency of new bookings, both of these look very much under control,” said Sanjeev Moghe, president and head, cards and payments at Axis Bank.  “We are confident that we can keep expanding scale without necessarily adding to incremental risk from here on. The book is very clean right now,” he added.  Indian banks have been aggressively chasing growth in the high-return but exposure-wise unsecured credit card business. Most banks have been upbeat about their credit card portfolios and are engaging in partnerships and tie-ups to add more customers. Axis Bank on March 30 had announced the acquisition of Citibank’s India consumer business for $1.6 billion in an all-cash deal.  On its part, HDFC Bank, after a good chunk of major market share in the credit card space due to a temporary ban on new digital offerings last year, has ramped up its business to gain market share.  Axis Bank is also confident its outstanding credit cards will be higher than what they were in the previous financial year, Moghe said.  The private lender had issued around 1.1 million credit cards in January-March, taking total card issuances in financial year 2022 to 2.7 million.  Axis Bank will continue to gain share in the merchant acquiring space and is also looking to launch some cards in partnership with other companies, Moghe said.  “We are looking at some co-branded credit cards. We launched one with Airtel in March, we have (another) one coming up this week,” Moghe said.  “Beyond that, there are discussions happening in the co-branded space. We will see those fructifying, but those will take six to 12 months,” he added. “Similarly, in the acquiring space, we are looking at a few things and will come by as we go through the year  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 21 announced new norms on credit and debit card issuance for 2022. The central bank said NBFCs with minimum net owned funds of Rs 100 crore can also issue credit cards provided they have a certificate of registration, apart from specific permission from the RBI to enter this business. The RBI also said that charges and interest rates on credit cards shall not be exorbitant and shall be connected with the cost incurred and reasonable expected returns.  The likelihood of NBFCs entering the credit card market will not lead to an incremental business disruption at Axis Bank, Moghe said.  “We are ready to face whatever competition we see in the market, whether it is from banks or NBFCs or fintechs,” he said. “I don’t see any incremental business disruption for Axis Bank.”  Although the impact of this circular on banks’ margins will be “marginal” going forward, it is unlikely to impact the long-term profitability of the banking sector, Moghe said.  In December 2020, the RBI had imposed restrictions on HDFC Bank after repeated outages at the lender's data centre. The restrictions barred HDFC Bank from launching any of the activities planned under its Digital 2.0 programme as well as the sourcing of new credit cards. The regulator revoked the ban completely in March.  When asked about the learnings for the bank from this debacle, Moghe said that Axis Bank continues to watch this space closely and is mindful that one cannot grow only when the competition takes a hit.  “We have put in investments in technology, we upgraded our cards platform some time back,” Moghe said.  “Whether it is the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) space or the cards space, we continue to invest in technology infrastructure. Having said that, we need to be very watchful about downtime incidents,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/axis-bank-plans-to-scale-up-credit-card-business-says-slippages-under-control-8483481.html
axis,2022-05-10T16:34:26+05:30,Kayezad E Adajania, Axis MF frontrunning case: Axis Bank awaits probe report; will not take action against mutual fund...,"The bank is standing by Axis Mutual Fund CEO and MD Chandresh Nigam after suspending two other fund house officials in connection with frontrunning allegations, say sources. But Nigam’s continuance might run afoul of the regulator.","Axis Bank will wait for the findings of an investigation into frontrunning allegations at Axis Mutual Fund before taking a final decision on penalising erring officials, according to people aware of the lender’s plans. Axis Bank is the sponsor of Axis MF, India’s seventh-largest fund house. The allegations of frontrunning at Axis MF are being probed by two external agencies appointed by the fund house. Front-running, in this case, refers to a mutual fund dealer trying to profit from his/her knowledge of orders that a fund house has lined up. While Axis MF says the probe started in February, no action was initiated against any officials for months and there was nothing in the public domain to indicate that the bank was conducting an investigation.  That changed only in the first week of May, when MC Insider published a small item on May 2 about a dealer at a fund house driving around in a Lamborghini, alluding to his disproportionate assets.  Subsequently, it emerged that the mutual fund was finally taking some preliminary action.  On May 6, Moneycontrol broke the news that Axis fund managers Viresh Joshi and Deepak Agarwal had been replaced (suspended) as fund managers on May 4.  No final action for now  No final action will be taken against any official, including Chandresh Nigam, managing director and chief executive officer of Axis Mutual Fund, until the investigation is completed, the people said. The fund house had launched the probe into allegations of frontrunning in February 2022, Nigam said in a communication to distributors and investors late on May 8. In the note, Axis MF asserted that it had started the probe on its own and that it was being carried out by external investigators. Preliminary action (suspension) had been taken against two fund managers (one of whom, Viresh Joshi, was the fund house’s chief dealer). Nigam assured investors of the “highest governance standards, stringent protocols and best-in-class processes for fund management.” Nigam’s Bloomberg ID suspended On May 6, when Moneycontrol broke the story of Axis fund managers Viresh Joshi and Deepak Agarwal being suspended, it had also come to light that Nigam’s Bloomberg ID had been taken down. Bloomberg is a database and market information system (aside from being a digital news media company) that portfolio managers and analysts globally use to monitor stocks, markets and portfolios. It is an important tool for portfolio managers, each of whom is assigned an email ID and a login ID. All Bloomberg chats are recorded. Additionally, many fund houses, including a few in India, use Bloomberg as their order management system to instruct brokers which stocks to buy and which ones to sell. Moneycontrol sources confirmed that the Bloomberg IDs of Joshi and Nigam had been deactivated since the evening of May 4. This means that these officials won’t have access to the Bloomberg system. As of May 10 morning, Nigam’s Bloomberg ID remained suspended. Asked to explain the implications of the suspension, a fund manager at another fund house said that it was an indication that a major violation is suspected. If found to be true, the implications for the violators would be very severe, he added. Moneycontrol reached out to Nigam, the fund house’s chief business officer Raghav Iyengar, its corporate communications officials as well as Axis Bank but was not able to elicit any response from them till publishing time. Axis MF, with assets worth over Rs 2.55 lakh crore, has 23 equity schemes, 19 debt schemes and 9 hybrid schemes. It also manages three funds that invest abroad and two gold exchange-traded funds. Does the buck stop at the CEO’s desk? Nigam’s continuance at the helm of the fund house might run afoul of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the capital markets regulator. In October 2020, SEBI had issued a code of conduct for dealers and fund managers at mutual fund houses. Among other things, the code of conduct stated that dealers and fund managers “shall not indulge in any unethical business activities, or professional misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud or deceit, or commit any act that could damage the reputation of the organisation.” It also instructed them to avoid “potential conflicts of interest.” More importantly, SEBI laid down that dealers and fund managers must conduct all communication during market hours only through recorded modes of communication (telephone lines, for instance — all conversations over the phone in dealing rooms are recorded). “All investment personnel desk phone calls are recorded during market hours. Cell phones are supposed to be kept aside or recorded if used for interaction with market intermediaries. Compliance officers have the authority to record calls and they keep the records,” said a manager at another fund house who did not want to be identified. SEBI had also made it the responsibility of the heads of fund houses (chief executive officer — whatever be the designation) to ensure that the code of conduct is followed in “letter and spirit.” Any breach of the code of conduct has to be brought to the attention of the board of directors of the asset management company and the trustees, SEBI had added. The regulator had stressed in the code that dealers and fund managers have to provide a self-certification once every three months that they have abided by the code of conduct. It was the responsibility of Nigam as head of Axis MF to ensure that his fund managers and dealers adhered to the code of conduct. Seen in this light, if his subordinates are found to have violated the SEBI code, he could face some heat from the regulator. “The chief executive officer has the responsibility to ensure that the code of conduct is followed by all such officers (fund managers, chief investment officers, dealers etc) because in the regulatory experience of some cases, perhaps some of them (CEOs) either turned a blind eye or were complicit. The regulatory expectation from them is very high,” said Sumit Agrawal, founding partner of Regstreet Law Advisor and a former SEBI officer. The timeline People familiar with Axis Bank’s thinking told Moneycontrol that the bank’s board has not given any timeline by which the investigation will be completed. It has asked the two probe agencies to submit their findings at the earliest. Axis MF maintains that the probe started in February 2022, suggesting that it is at least into its third month. A person with knowledge of the matter said a chartered accountancy firm (one of the Big Four) and a law firm have been appointed to jointly investigate the matter. Moneycontrol has not been able to confirm this. SEBI is said to be monitoring the developments and the probe report is expected in a few weeks.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/axis-mf-frontrunning-case-axis-bank-awaits-probe-report-will-not-take-action-against-mutual-fund-officials-for-now-8482791.html

Touted as the UPI moment for lending, the AA framework ensures swift data sharing with the consent of the user and eliminates the need for physical documents.  Since it went live in September 2021, 332,000 customer accounts have been linked and over 310,000 consent requests have been fulfilled.  The framework facilitates sharing of financial information on a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs).  FIPs are institutions that hold customer data and FIUs are entities that consume data to offer better service, underwrite loans, and so on. Banks and other financial institutions must become FIPs to be able to also become users of data from other financial institutions.  An AA is data blind and only receives encrypted data which is decrypted only by the FIU.  Union Bank of India has said that it will work both as an FIU and FIP to allow its customers to share data digitally on a real-time basis.  Major private sector banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are already live as FIPs and FIUs. There are 34 banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and other institutions so far live on AA, including Federal Bank, IDFC First Bank and IndusInd Bank.  Moneycontrol had reported on January 17 that the next step for the ecosystem is to grow the number of FIPs and get more banks to go live, mainly the State Bank of India (SBI) which has the largest share of accounts in India.  As per information on the website of Sahamati, a not-for-profit self-organised collective for the AA ecosystem, SBI is in the testing mode.  The ecosystem is also working on linking accounts of Small and Medium Enterprises as only individual current and savings accounts are linked currently. Insurers are working on integrating too and the next step will be to get mutual funds on board.  CAMS, FinVu, NADL and OneMoney have launched AA app and website interfaces for customers to use.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/union-bank-becomes-first-public-sector-bank-to-go-live-on-account-aggregator-framework-8434251.html

However, lower LLP led to a slight beat on PAT at Rs41bn (est: Rs40bn). Axis has taken back earlier exit cost/asset guidance of 2% in Q4FY23 (~2% in FY22), as it may look at accelerated investments in the near-to-medium term, and thus may hurt core earnings. However, Axis retains medium-term RoE guidance of 16-16.5% and long-term RoE aspiration of 18%. We have slightly trimmed our earnings estimates, factoring in higher costs but expect RoE to gradually improve to ~14-16% over FY23-25E from ~7%/12% in FY21/22E. Axis has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Citi Bank’s retail portfolio, including cards, CASA rich deposit pool and nearly 3,600 employees, at a higher price of USD1.6bn/Rs123bn (ex-integration cost of Rs15bn). We believe the acquisition will boost the bank’s retail/card portfolios, but the payback period could be longer and would also dilute the CET 1 ratio by 230bps to ~13%, calling for equity/RoE dilution post the acquisition (Q4FY23). Outlook We retain our long-term Buy rating on the stock with a TP of Rs1,020 (value standalone bank at 1.9x FY24E ABV vs. 2x Dec’23 ABV due to higher CoE and subs valuation at Rs73) given steady improvement in RoEs and reasonable valuations.

One is just in terms of the number of cards, second, it will impact the margins,” Sanjeev Moghe, EVP &amp;amp; Head, cards &amp;amp; Payments at Axis Bank, told reporters in a conference call on quarterly results. “However, we have seen that when we have cycles of regulatory changes and credit cycles, the business inherently bounces back.”  Moghe added that the circular may not impact the bank’s co-branded card segment. The bank’s strong momentum in issuing credit cards is likely to continue going forward, Moghe added.  Axis Bank issued around 1.1 million credit cards in January-March, taking total card issuances in the financial year 2022 to 2.7 million.  The RBI on April 21 came out with a fresh set of guidelines for credit and debit card issuance for 2022. These guidelines will come into effect from July 1 and are applicable to all banks excluding payments banks, state cooperative banks, and district central cooperative banks. These norms are aimed at protecting the interests of retail consumers.  Meanwhile, Axis Bank will explore capital raising for the Citi Bank deal only when it approaches the timeline, its managing director and chief executive Amitabh Chaudhry said.  “As a prudent management team, we will explore capital raising. Let's come closer to some timeline when the transaction actually happens. There is no point in raising capital if the transaction keeps getting postponed.”  Chief financial officer Puneet Sharma said that the bank will continue to see improvement in net interest margins (NIM) in a rising interest scenario only over the coming quarters.  “NIM is a journey for us, it’s an eight to twelve-quarter journey,” Sharma added.  Axis Bank on Thursday reported a massive 54 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit largely driven by a significant fall in provisions and improved asset quality performance for the quarter ended March 2022. Profit increased to Rs 4,117.8 crore during the quarter, compared to Rs 2,677 crore in the same period last year, the bank said in its BSE filing.  Provisions and contingencies in Q4FY22 declined sharply by 54.4 percent to Rs 987.2 crore compared to the corresponding period last fiscal, while the sequential decline was 26 percent.  The bank said it has not utilised COVID provisions during the quarter. It holds cumulative provisions (standard + additional other than NPA) of Rs 12,428 crore at the end of Q4FY22.)

axis,2022-04-22T19:06:00+05:30,Pushpita Dey, Account aggregator system in banking ensures enhanced customer experience with better data security:...,The network is a financial data-sharing system regulated by the Reserve Bank of India,"The account aggregator (AA) ecosystem, introduced in September 2021, can ensure better security and stronger protection of banking data while enhancing customers’ experience, say experts. Nine private banks including, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and IndusInd Bank went live on the AA system last year and five public sector banks will join this year.  The AA network is a financial data-sharing system regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). One of its main features is that data cannot be shared without the consent of the individual concerned.  The finance ministry in the first week of September 2021 said eight of India’s largest banks had introduced the system, even though its concept was approved by the RBI in 2016 itself.  Better user experience  The government when introducing it said the AA system was aimed at helping individuals securely and digitally access the information they have with a financial institution as well as share this information with any other regulated financial institution within the AA network. Banks that have implemented the system say the network has been built with the customer at the center. It empowers customers to effectively manage their data.  “They have the power to decide with whom their data can be shared, for what purpose it can be used, and for what duration it can be retained,” said Deepak Sharma, president and chief digital officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank.  At its launch, the government said the AA system replaces the complex ‘terms and conditions’ form of ‘blank cheque’ acceptance with granular, step-by-step permissions and control each time the customer’s data is used.  “In a regular scenario, there is significant effort involved, wherein the customer has to share their banking data with another bank/financial institution using hard copies or PDF documents. However, with the AA framework, it is very easy for customers to share information either one time or on an ongoing basis for a defined period of time,” said Sameer Shetty, president, and head, of digital business and transformation, Axis Bank.  Moreover, as pointed out by various lenders, the system makes things easier for customers, eliminating duplication and paperwork to offer seamless information to banks.  “The ease of on-boarding and managing consent by customers will ensure large-scale adoption in every nook and corner of the country,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, MD and CEO, South Indian Bank.  Enhanced encryption of users’ data  The system aims to create a third-party trusted source of information that allows seamless data flow between all players, say experts. “In various cases, once customers’ data is shared with a bank for one purpose, it gets circulated among other departments too. For example, if a customer shares her/his data for a housing loan, it might happen that the vehicle loan department may get access to it. But the AA system prohibits that,” said Nageen Kommu, founder and CEO, Digitap, a tech company providing AI-driven solutions for the banking industry.  Customers can choose which department their data will be shared with and the system minimises the chance of data sharing even within various departments of the same bank. “The system enables customers to offer authentic information in a controlled and managed environment to all the players in the ecosystem, including banks,” said Kunal Jhunjhunwala, founder and MD, Airpay, a payment gateway for banks.  It helps customers take real-time lending decisions in multi-bank personal finance management (PFM) and maintain a consolidated financial dashboard while also enabling wealth assessment and planning, all the while ensuring encryption.  “AA handles the consent management part on behalf of the customer and the data is exchanged only between financial information users (FIU) and financial information providers ensuring that only the right FIU receives the data,” said Sharma.  The privacy aspect is well taken care of by the regulator requiring customer consent. This can pave the road to full-fledged open banking in India going forward, according to Ramakrishnan.  What next?  Although widely accepted in the banking sector, several experts asserted that there is still room for improvement for the system. Banks already part of the AA system said more banks joining it will strengthen it further. “In future, the addition of GST (goods and services tax), PF (provident fund) and utility bills information in the AA framework will make it truly transformational,” added Shetty.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/account-aggregator-system-in-banking-ensures-enhanced-customer-experience-with-better-data-security-experts-8397501.html

This is the internal reference rate based on which rates are set for various types of loans,"State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, increased its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points across tenors, effective April 15.  The overnight, one-month and three-month MCLRs have been hiked to 6.75 percent each from 6.65 percent earlier, according to SBI’s website.  The one-year MCLR currently stands at 7.10 percent from 7 percent earlier. The six-month MCLR is now 7.05 percent from 6.95 percent previously.  The two-year and three-year MCLRs have been hiked 10 bps each to 7.30 percent and 7.40 percent, respectively.  Also, private sector lender Axis Bank has hiked MCLR by 5 bps across tenures effective today, April 18.  MCLR is an internal reference rate for banks set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to help define the minimum interest rate on various types of loans, including home loans.  The RBI’s repo rate has been kept unchanged at 4 percent since May 2020. That’s the rate at which the central bank lends short-term funds to banks.  Retail inflation in India jumped to a 17-month high of 6.95 percent in March from 6.07 percent in February, driven by high food prices. If inflation concerns persist and there are no shocks to growth, interest rates will likely be hiked later this year, analysts said.  Most economists expect the RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC) to change its stance to ‘neutral’ in June and follow up with an increase in the key policy rate, which could be the first in a series of hikes this year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/state-bank-of-india-hikes-key-reference-lending-rate-by-10-bps-across-tenors-8372891.html

While Axis Bank faced the action for violating certain directions issued by the RBI regarding banking services such as loans, levy of penal charges on non-maintenance of minimum balances in savings bank accounts, Know your customer (KYC) services etc, IDBI Bank violated regulations related to frauds and cyber security, the central bank said in separate statements.  RBI clarified in the statements that the penalties are not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the banks with its customers.  RBI conducted the Statutory Inspections for Supervisory Evaluation recently on both the banks regarding their financial positions as on March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, and examined the respective Risk Assessment Report, Inspection Report and all related correspondences pertaining to the same.  After examination and evaluation, it was revealed that Axis bank failed to maintain the prescribed margin in case of intraday facilities sanctioned to stockbrokers and also did not follow restrictive practices in the sale of insurance products to customers. Further, the bank even failed to verify the copy of officially valid documents so produced by the clients, with the originals, while establishing account-based relationships. RBI even found some customer IDs having multiple CIFs instead of a Unique Customer Identification Code (UCIC), and there has been instances of penal charges being levied for non-maintenance of minimum balance in savings bank accounts, not directly proportionate to the extent of the shortfall observed.  On the other hand, for IDBI Bank, the RBI reported incidents of multiple fraudulent transactions over two days on June 08 and 09, 2019 in the accounts of two corporate net banking customers (Co-operative banks). The bank delayed in reporting frauds to RBI and also there was a delay in submission of Flash Reports in respect of frauds involving an amount of Rs 5 crore and above to RBI. IDBI also failed to implement time restrictions on holidays and data access control for corporate net banking to put through fund transfer resulting in unauthorized debit transactions in the account of two co-operative banks.  “In furtherance to the same, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause, as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for non-compliance with the RBI directions, as stated therein,” RBI mentioned in their release.

axis,2022-04-08T13:21:18+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,These 10 rate-sensitive stocks look bright as RBI keeps monetary policy on expected lines,Moneycontrol has collated a list of rate-sensitive stocks that may be a good buy at current levels or on dips from a 2-3 weeks' perspective. Returns are calculated based on April 7 closing price.,"The monetary policy announced by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 8 was largely on expected lines with the repo and reverse repo rate left unchanged at 4 percent and 3.35 percent, respectively, with an upward revision in inflation and cut in growth forecast, citing the spike in commodity prices due to supply disruptions caused by the Ukraine-Russia war.  The central bank has maintained its ‘accommodative stance’ while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.  Analysts say the RBI has chosen to support growth over inflation by keeping the rates at the same level. “We believe it is a sensible choice because for India to attract foreign capital it will have to focus on generating growth. It has tried its best to balance the sharp increase in inflation forecast and a lower GDP growth forecast,” said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Piper Serica.  He believes that the RBI does not want to signal a series of rate hikes that will increase the cost of borrowing and negatively impact the nascent recovery in consumer sentiment, manufacturing and rural income. “The hope is that with supply bottlenecks easing inflation will trend down.” Rate-sensitive stocks including banks, financial services, auto and realty largely remained flat as the policy was on expected lines.  After the sharp increase in oil prices, the key element in the import bill, the RBI has lowered its GDP forecast to 7.2 percent for FY23 from 7.8 percent earlier, while significantly raising the full-year CPI inflation forecast to 5.7 percent from 4.5 percent earlier.  The central bank assumed oil price at $100 a barrel for forecasting economic growth and CPI inflation. “This implies that growth and inflation can be better if crude declines sharply if the war hopefully ends early,” said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.  The MPC is of the view that since the February meeting, the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions, generalised hardening of global commodity prices, the likelihood of prolonged supply chain disruptions, dislocations in trade and capital flows, divergent monetary policy responses and volatility in global financial markets are imparting sizeable upside risks to the inflation trajectory and downside risks to domestic growth.  Also read - 10-year bond yield hits 7%, first time since June 2019  Given the cross-current of multiple headwinds, “our approach needs to be cautious but proactive in mitigating the adverse impact on India’s growth, inflation and financial conditions”, said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das while addressing a press conference.  He added that the RBI is, however, reassured by the strong buffers that India has built over the past few years, including large foreign exchange reserves, significant improvement in external sector indicators and substantial strengthening of the financial sector, all of which would help weather this storm. “Once again, we in the RBI stand resolute and in readiness to defend the economy and navigate out of the current storm.”  Das rightly emphasised India’s macro strengths, pointing to the improvement in the external situation helped by record exports, ample forex reserves of $606.5 billion and strengthening of the financial sector, said Vijayakumar.  The RBI has introduced the standing deposit facility (SDF) as a new tool to absorb liquidity. The SDF rate, which will now be the floor of the liquidity adjustment facility corridor, will be at 3.75 percent.  Follow LIVE Updates of the RBI Monetary Policy decision here  We have collated a list of rate-sensitive stocks that may be a good buy at current levels or on dips from a two to three weeks’ perspective. Returns are calculated based on April 7 closing price:  Expert: Malay Thakkar, Technical Research Associate at GEPL Capital  ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 748.55 | Stop-Loss: 695 | Target: Rs 860 | Return: 15 percent  On long-term charts, ICICI Bank is moving in a strong uptrend with higher highs and higher lows formation.  After a nearly 25 percent correction from the life-high levels of Rs 864, ICICI Bank took support at its 38.2 percent retracement level (Rs 640) and the stock has seen a sharp bounce since then.  On the weekly charts the stock has surpassed its 20-week SMA or simple moving average (Rs 746) and now trades at the five-week high. The weekly RSI or relative strength index indicator is moving higher after forming a bullish hinge near the 40 mark.  Going ahead we can expect the stock price to move higher towards Rs 820 followed by Rs 860 level. We recommend a stop-loss of Rs 695 for this trade.    Bank of Baroda: Buy | LTP: Rs 119.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 110 | Target: Rs 142 | Return: 19 percent  Bank of Baroda is moving in an uptrend with higher highs and lows since March 2020. In the current week, the stock has broken above the previous swing high (Rs 118) with an uptick in volumes.  On the daily charts, we see the stock is moving out of a rounding pattern which is an accumulation pattern.  The RSI indicator on all timeframes i.e., daily, weekly and monthly, is above the 60 mark indicating bullish momentum in the prices.  Going ahead we expect the prices to move higher towards Rs 132 followed by Rs 142. We recommend a stop-loss of Rs 110 on daily closing basis.    Expert - Rohan Patil, Technical Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio  M&amp;amp;M Financial Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 169.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 161.50 | Target: Rs 184 | Return: 8 percent  M&amp;amp;M Financial Services has given a smart V-shaped reversal rally on the daily chart and has given more than 30 percent in just one month indicating bulls are back in action. The prices have given a falling trend line breakout on the daily chart which indicates a positive momentum is likely to continue.  The momentum oscillator RSI (14) is reading in a higher-high, higher-low formation and has also given a horizontal trend line breakout above 60 levels on the daily timeframe.  Prior breakout prices consolidated for almost seven trading sessions and we witnessed above-average volume activity during that period, indicating accumulation stage for the counter.  While looking at the overall price formation and fresh breakout, we expect prices to trade higher towards Rs 184 levels.    Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 792 | Stop-Loss: Rs 760 | Target: Rs 847 | Return: 7 percent  Axis Bank has been outperforming its peer stocks consistently for the past few weeks and has given a downward sloping trend line breakout on the daily timeframe.  After touching the lower band of the trend line which is near Rs 660 levels, the counter closed above its five-week high and has given handsome returns of 20 percent in just one month.  On March 30, prices closed above its 21-, 50- and 100-day exponential moving averages and since then prices never retested below its averages and continued to trade higher. On the broader timeframe, prices are moving out of a symmetrical triangle pattern which is a strong bullish signal.  While looking at the overall price formation and fresh breakout, we are expecting prices to trade higher towards Rs 847 levels.    Expert: Mehul Kothari, AVP - Technical Research at Anand Rathi Shares &amp;amp; Stock Brokers  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,517 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 | Target: Rs 1,625 | Return: 7 percent  After the recent correction, HDFC Bank is hovering near the 61.8 percent retracement level of the entire rally which started from Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,700. This support coincides with the gap area formed due to the merger news.  The support zone is also the placement of the Kijun of Ichimoku indicator. Hence there is a high probability that the stock might resume its uptrend.

axis,2022-04-06T13:51:01+05:30,Reuters,"CCI probes debt trustee units of SBI, Axis, IDBI on suspected fee cartel: Report","The three under investigation - SBICAP Trustee Company, Axis Trustee and IDBI Trusteeship - are among the leaders in the business in India overseeing hundreds of billions of dollars by rendering trustee services for not just debt securities, but also real estate and other investment funds.","India's antitrust body is investigating the trustee units of State Bank of India, Axis Bank and IDBI Bank for suspected collusion on fees, triggering a lawsuit by a group representing them, documents seen by Reuters showed.  Indian regulations mandate that companies raising debt appoint a so-called &quot;debenture trustee&quot; to protect the interests of investors. The trustees charge a fee from the companies issuing the debt and make independent due-diligence checks on them.  The three under investigation - SBICAP Trustee Company, Axis Trustee and IDBI Trusteeship - are among the leaders in the business in India overseeing hundreds of billions of dollars by rendering trustee services for not just debt securities, but also real estate and other investment funds.  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in a confidential December order stated the Trustees Association of India - a body where the trio are founding members - last year &quot;substantially&quot; increased the fee for assisting companies raising debt and prevented members from going below a floor price, thereby hurting competition.  The association has launched a court challenge in Mumbai that seeks to quash the antitrust investigation directive it has termed &quot;illegal&quot; and &quot;capricious&quot;, according to court filings. The lawsuit will be heard on Thursday.  The antitrust probe and the impending court hearing, details of which have not been previously reported, could have ramifications on India's nearly $500 billion corporate debt market by altering costs and affecting the way trustees operate.  A finding of cartelisation could lead to a fine of up to three times the profit in each year the fee was fixed by the trustees, or 10 percent of annual revenue for the period of violation, whichever is more.  SBICAP Trustee and IDBI Trusteeship didn't respond to requests for comment. Axis Trustee, which is listed as President of the Trustee Association in documents, also didn't respond.  The CCI, which does not publicly disclose its cartel probes that are underway, did not respond to an email seeking comment.  COMPLAINT BY BORROWER  The antitrust case was triggered by a complaint from Indian gold financing company Muthoot Finance. When it wanted to raise debt in August last year, Muthoot received a costing proposal which was 300 percent higher than previous rates.  The documents showed that when Muthoot protested, IDBI said in an August email &quot;the new pricing structure is decided by the Trustee Association&quot;, adding that &quot;any deviation by us in quoting the price would lead to adverse repercussion on us&quot;.  The CCI, while ordering its investigation, noted: &quot;Such collective decision making by the association ... affects competition in the markets.&quot;  In February it asked the trustee association to submit their meeting records and explain its role in fixing a minimum fee structure, one document showed.  The trustee association has defended itself in the court filings by saying the higher fee was justified as their cost burden had gone up over the years due to enhanced regulatory compliance requirements.  It said it had informed the market regulator SEBI last year that the pricing structure will be decided by trustees, but it &quot;will not be below the benchmark floor price&quot;.  The group said that the matter, by law, can only be investigated by a &quot;specialised sectoral regulator&quot;, in this case SEBI.  SEBI, already &quot;provides enough checks and balances to deal with any price rigging (cartelisation),&quot; it argued.  Before approaching the antitrust body, Muthoot also lodged a complaint against the trustees with SEBI, which is still being reviewed, the documents stated.  SEBI and Muthoot did not respond to Reuters queries.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cci-probes-debt-trustee-units-of-sbi-axis-idbi-on-suspected-fee-cartel-report-8323991.html

At an acquisition cost of US$1.6bn, while the deal appears to be a bargain for Axis Bank, the value accretion from Citi’s portfolio over the medium term is contingent on a host of factors including retention of existing customers, Axis Bank’s ability to continually add customers of such profile and its ability to up-sell and cross-sell. Although the Citibank transaction adds significant heft to Axis Bank’s competitive positioning across cards and wealth management businesses, we believe that Axis Bank will need to up its game in order to create sustainable value from the Citibank portfolio.

The purchase should provide a strategic thrust to the bank’s retail banking aspirations and otherwise lagging RoAs in the long run as synergy benefits kick in. Following are the key takeaways from the call and our view: Axis would acquire consumer banking assets to the tune of Rs502bn, including loans worth Rs274bn (Mortgages: Rs100bn, Cards: Rs89bn, other retail/small banking loans: Rs85bn) and liquid assets of Rs228bn, against the liabilities/deposits of Rs502bn (including 81% CASA), making the transaction NAV neutral. Moreover, Axis will get wealth management, private banking and Insurance distribution businesses. The bank will make an offer to 3,600 Citi Consumer employees to join Axis, which will be essential for a smooth transition and scaling up of the business. After the deal, Axis Bank's loan/deposit base will increase by just 4%/7%. However, its CASA ratio will improve by 200bps to 47%, leading to some benefit on CoF, partly offset by a higher savings rate of 3% vs. 2.5% offered by Citi (will help with customer retention). The bank will also get access to a strong and affluent retail customer base for cross-selling, and thus driving in revenue gains (including fees) in the long run.

The deal includes the Credit Card, Wealth, and Retail Banking operations of both Citibank India and Citicorp Finance. It will acquire loans/deposits worth INR274b/INR509b, including the Credit Card book of INR89b. This will increase its Credit Card book by 57% to INR244b and propel it to among the top three players. Wealth Management AUM will rise ~42% to INR3.8t, making it the third largest player on combined AUM. AXSB will acquire ~3m unique customers, complemented by Citibank's Affluent Customer segment. Post-acquisition, it will have ~28.5m savings accounts, more than 0.23m Burgundy customers, and 10.6m cards. While synergies in terms of cost savings and RoA accretion will take more than two years to accrue, the deal, at 18.7x P/E on CY20 normalized earnings, makes limited economic sense from medium term perspective given the declining revenue profile /cards base of Citi’s business, higher capital charge and high integration cost to be absorbed over the next 2 years. However, over the long term, the success of deal would depend on how well AXSB is able to cross sell its entire bouquet of banking products to Citi customers and also gain from Citi’s well recognized digital and operation processes. CET I ratio is likely to moderate by ~230bp to ~13%, the lowest in the past three years, and may necessitate another capital raise over FY23.  Outlook However, the small acquisition size (~4% of loans) will have a limited impact on overall profitability. We maintain our Buy rating, but reduce our TP to INR930/share (2x FY24E P/ABV).

Deposits/assets to be purchased will be Rs502bn/274bn with credit card portfolio of Rs89bn. Rationale for the deal is (i) building a premium base of customers and increasing granularity (ii) Citi’s portfolio complementing that of Axis, as both entities have different customer profile and (iii) good cross sell opportunities for Axis which would eventually lead to synergies. In our view, the deal is positive for Axis Bank in medium term, however the key is customer retention. With systemic asset quality risk receding and credit growth prospects improving, Axis could be one of the main beneficiaries.

Except for Singaporean lender DBS Bank, which has expanded its presence in the country and also acquired a domestic private sector bank, many foreign lenders have cut their presence in the country due to a slew of reasons, including global strategies or also technological shifts like automation and online banking which make branch banking redundant.  The foreign lenders also have a litany of concerns with the regulatory landscape in India, starting with priority sector lending (PSL) under which they have to devote 40 per cent of their loans to segments mandated by the government or face a penalty, the insistence on operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary and not as a branch of a foreign subsidiary to ring-fence local operations and also others like data localisation.  However, nearly all the major foreign lenders including those who do not have banking operations in the country, use India as a back office to support their global operations and employ thousands of techies in cities like Bengaluru and Pune.  Before Citi's exit from the consumer banking business was announced on Wednesday, global banking majors such as ANZ Grindlays, RBS, Commonwealth Bank of Australia have scaled down their operations in India.  Citi's scaling down of operations in India is part of its strategy to exit retail businesses in 13 markets to conserve capital and focus on higher-yielding revenue streams. It had entered India in 1902 and started the consumer banking business in 1985.  Earlier in 2012, British banking major Barclays massively scaled down India operations by closing a third of its branches located in the non-metro areas. Shrinking its operations in India was part of the UK based bank's strategy to move away from retail banking to concentrate more on the corporate banking, investment banking and wealth management verticals.  In 2016, Commonwealth Bank of Australia exited India operations saying the decision was taken after a careful evaluation of its India operations alongside its refocussed strategy.  The same year, Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) too decided to wind up its corporate, retail, and institutional banking business in the Indian market as it wanted to reduce its global footprint.  Australia and New Zealand Bank, in 2000, wound up domestic operations here after selling its Grindlays Bank unit to Standard Chartered for USD 1.34 billion. However, it re-entered the Indian market in 2011 by opening a new branch in Mumbai.  ANZ was in India since 1984 through its presence as Grindlays Bank. In 2011, Deutsche Bank sold its credit card business to IndusInd Bank. In 2013, UBS exited India operations while Morgan Stanley surrendered its banking license while continuing its investment banking business.  Likewise, Merril Lynch, Barclays and Standard Chartered scaled down their operations in 2015.  Among others, HSBC halved its branches to just over two dozen on technological shifts, and reduced its presence in 14 cities in 2016, while BNP Paribas shut down its wealth management business in India in 2020.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/citi-joins-list-of-foreign-banks-scaling-down-india-operations-with-rs-12325-crore-arm-sale-to-axis-bank-8299701.html

The buyout will give Axis Bank access to 2.5 million Citibank customer cards and will result in an increase of around 31% to its existing card base.  The transaction will aid the lender in increasing its card spends market share by 480 basis points, the MD said. “Citibank has a complimentary and quality portfolio of close to 2.5 million cards with amongst the highest monthly spends per card across industry and a book size of approximately Rs 8,900 crore as of June 2021,” he added.  Further, post conclusion of the transaction, the combined assets under management of Axis Bank’s wealth management business will increase by 42%, making it the third-largest wealth manager in the country, as per Chaudhry.  The combined current account and savings account ratio, on a proforma basis, post completion of the transaction would improve by 200 basis points to 47% and it will also be liquidity coverage ratio accretive, the management said.  “The consumer lending portfolio of approximately Rs 18,500 crore consists of mortgages, asset-backed finance, small business lending, and personal loans. These are our focus segments as well and will deepen our relationship in this space by offering differentiated financial solutions,” the MD said.  Apart from improvement in the CASA ratio, net interest margin, and credit card market share, the deal would also give Axis Bank access to the premium set of high spending customers.  Addressing a press conference today, Chaudry said Axis Bank has grown organically all these years and scaled well but its aspirations are bigger. “This deal gives us the strategic thrust to close the gap between us and some of our peers. We hope this particular acquisition will improve the quality of our franchise across many parameters meaningfully,” he said.  When asked whether the bank will raise capital to fund this acquisition, Chaudhry said the bank intends to pay for this transaction from its own balance sheet. However, going ahead depending on the credit demand and macro-economic conditions, the bank will look at raising capital.  On a question about how the bank aims to tackle the attrition problem of Citibank India customers, Chaudhry said as per data shared by Citi with the bank, the customer retention levels remain satisfactory.  “Obviously there is a risk that there could be customer attrition. We believe very strongly that Axis Bank has a bigger suite of products and services to offer to Citibank customers. Citibank was limited by branch presence, perks that it could offer, Axis Bank has much more to offer,” he said.  He added that there were certain price-adjusted mechanisms that were part of the deal which will kick in if customer attrition goes beyond certain numbers.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/deal-of-a-lifetime-axis-banks-amitabh-chaudhry-cheers-citibank-indias-portfolio-buyout-8296641.html

The intent behind this initiative is to give these women the confidence that they are employable, they have skills and they can fit in various job roles in a bank and it is about getting these women back to work, Axis Bank President and Head (HR) Rajkamal Vempati said in an interaction on the bank's recent hiring initiative 'HouseWorkIsWork'.  She said it is a challenge for a large organisation like Axis Bank to hire right and skilled people and 'HouseWorkIsWork' is the bank's way of exploring beyond the tried templates.  &quot;This is one way of saying that we move beyond the templates and be open to hiring different kinds of people. It is also about the women who have not participated in the workforce.  &quot;The point to be highlighted is that the urban educated Indian women are not there much in the workforce and this is about getting these women to the workforce,&quot; Vempati said.  Citing an example, she said the idea of 'HouseWorkIsWork' bloomed from one interesting and innovative resume of one such latest hiree Pallavi Sharma, who beautifully put her various job roles at home akin to those at professional organisations.  Pallavi's resume introduces her as an employee at 'Sharma Residence' in roles such as head multiple projects (finance and HR; DE&amp;amp;I, learning and development; facilities and employee engagement) and these are all the roles she plays while managing her household, finances and raising kids, among others.  This pushed the bank to not only rethink about their hiring heuristics but also take steps to bring about a paradigm shift in people's mindsets about the valuable work undertaken by homemakers instead of categorising that as a break, Vempati said.  Axis Bank has been receiving encouraging participation from women across the country for these job offers ranging from freelancers, customer care executives, IT professionals, human resources, CSR and others that can keep women employed or regain work.  &quot;There are many women who want to come full time, so it extends to all formats of work not only GIG-A, including women who want to come and work in branches,&quot; said the HR head of the lender.  GIG-A-Opportunities is Axis Bank's new platform for alternative work models to attract the finest talent, with a promise of growth with flexibility, diversity and inclusivity. She said that given the overwhelming response, of over 3,000 resumes received, the bank has pushed the cap to hire more over time.  On the salary part, Axis Bank will pay such joinees as per their suitability to the job, skill-set and experience. The price of the job is more important, and the employee benefits will be at par with the regular employees, Vempati added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/axis-bank-rolls-out-houseworkiswork-initiative-to-bring-educated-women-to-workforce-8205451.html

Subject to approval from the RBI, an agreement for the consumer unit is scheduled to be announced in the next few weeks.  Various media reports have noted that the deal would include a cash component of less than $2 billion, accounting for the consumer business's liabilities. Citi's India retail business involves over 2.5 million customers and more than 1.2 million bank accounts.  Last month, Moneycontrol had reported that Axis Bank was most likely to strike an all-cash deal for Citi's India retail assets, which could be worth $1.5 billion. This would include milestone payments of up to $300-400 million depending on the future performance.  Axis Bank emerged as the lead buyer after beating out rivals like Kotak, another private lender which was reportedly &quot;more aggressive&quot; and had submitted a bid lower than that of Axis. Other factors like job security for current Citigroup employees, competition concerns, and more were also considered before taking the final call.  Reports suggest that Axis Bank will need around six more months to merge its consumer business in the country with Citigroup’s once the acquisition comes through.  To put Citi’s consumer business in India, which comprises credit cards, retail banking, home loans, and wealth management into perspective, the bank has 35 branches in the country and employs 4,000 people in the consumer banking business. It had a 0.6 percent market share in advances and 1.1 percent in deposits, along with 2.58 million credit cards outstanding, as of October 2021.  The offloading of retail banking segments by Citigroup forms a part of the comprehensive restructuring undertaken by the US lender to do away with such operations in 13 countries, namely Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, whilst maintaining an exclusive focus on high-growth businesses like wealth management.  This augurs well for Axis Bank as well, which is India's third-largest private sector lender and has been looking to boost retail loans to harness the pent-up demand in the wake of the pandemic.  In January, the bank had stated that its quarterly profit more than tripled on robust earnings from lending and its non-core business fees and trading, as the easing of the coronavirus pandemic helped a revival of consumer demand.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/axis-to-acquire-citigroups-indian-retail-banking-wing-for-around-2-5-billion-8089951.html

For any further upside, it is important that the index breaks and sustains above 17,750-17,800 resistance zone.","The Nifty saw good upside during the last 5-6 trading sessions and post the budget session. After nearly 1,000 points rally from 16,840 to 17,800 level, the index is now facing resistance at the 20-day SMA (17,750) (simple moving average) which confluences with the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the previous fall (18,350-16,840).  From past 2 sessions, the index is facing resistance in the 17,750-17,800 zone. The downside support for the index is placed at 17,440 (50-day SMA) followed by 17,250 level.  Broadly, we expect the index to trade in a range of 17,000-17,800. For any further upside, it is important that the index breaks and sustains above 17,750-17,800 resistance zone.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 799.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 760 | Target: Rs 936 | Return: 17 percent  Axis Bank has been forming a higher high higher low pattern after bouncing off the Rs 648 mark. In the week started January 24, 2022 the stock broke above the 20-Week SMA (Rs 734) post which the prices continued to move higher.  The RSI (relative strength index) plotted on the weekly time frame has moved above the 50 mark and is currently moving higher towards the overbought level, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to move higher towards the previous swing high of Rs 870, after that we might see a move towards Rs 936.  We recommend a stop-loss of Rs 760 on daily closing basis.    Maruti Suzuki: Buy | LTP: Rs 8,593.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 8,200 | Target: Rs 10,000 | Return: 16 percent  Maruti has been witnessing a rangebound move since January 2021 and has been moving between Rs 6,400-8,353.

The RSI plotted on the weekly chart can be seen placed above the 50 nark and moving higher, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.  Going ahead, we might see the prices move higher towards the Rs 9,600 mark. If the prices manage to breach above the Rs 9,600 mark we might see further up move towards the Rs 10,000 level.  We recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 8,200 on daily closing basis.    Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 392.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 370 | Target: Rs 460 | Return: 17 percent  Biocon has broken above the 6 months consolidation. Along with the breakout the stock has also breached above the 50-week SMA resistance and formed a strong bullish candle.  The RSI indicator plotted has also broken out of the range and is confirming the breakout.  We expect the stock to move higher towards Rs 430 and if managed to cross above Rs 430 then eventually towards Rs 460 level. One should maintain a strict stop-loss of Rs 370 on daily closing basis for this trade.

The BSE Sensex added more than 360 points to close above 57,850 levels, while the Nifty50 rallied more than 120 points to close above 17,270 levels, backed by Banks, Auto, FMCG, Metals and Pharma stocks.  The broader markets also participated in the bull run with the Nifty Midcap 100 index and Smallcap 100 indexes rising 1 percent each.  Maruti Suzuki, closing 6.83 percent higher at Rs 8,602.60 apiece, was the top Nifty gainer, followed by Axis Bank, which settled 6.76 percent higher at Rs 752.20 per share.  Zee Entertainment Enterprises, surging 7.72 percent to close at Rs 288.80 apiece, was the top gainer in the futures &amp;amp; options segment. On the other hand, Bharat Dynamics rose 4.16 percent to settle at record closing high of Rs 465.35.  Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Maruti Suzuki India  This counter seems to have registered multiple breakouts apart from a minor consolidation breakout on daily chart. However, on weekly charts this counter is moving in a well-defined 30 week channel and hence its initial target can be the upper boundary of the said channel whose value is placed around Rs 8,700 levels.  Therefore, for further upsides it needs a breakout above the said channel and in that scenario eventually life time highs present around Rs 9,990 can be expected.  For time being, fresh buying should be considered on dips but with a stop-loss placed below Rs 7,887 on closing basis and look for near term target of Rs 9,000 levels.    Zee Entertainment Enterprises  This counter appears to have taken support as it entered into the wide bullish gap zone of Rs 281 – Rs 261 levels registered on September 22, 2021. Considering the strong bounce witnessed in last trading session a tradable bounce can be expected from the current levels.  Therefore, sustaining above Rs 262 levels a higher target of Rs 330 can be expected. Dips can be considered as an opportunity to create fresh longs with a stop below Rs 260.    Axis Bank  Strong recovery of this counter by erasing 8-day old corrective structure in just a single session is hinting not only the end of correction but also suggesting this counter might have embarked on a fresh leg of upswing.  Therefore, any dip towards its 200-day moving average (Rs 718) can be an opportunity to create fresh long positions and sustaining above Rs 708 levels a higher target of Rs 820 can be expected. Stop-loss suggested for the trade is a close below Rs 718 levels.    Bharat Dynamics  This counter is displaying a better relative strength, when compared to the indices, as it remained unruffled even in the midst last 5-day carnage of the broader markets.  Moreover, for last 64 weeks this counter is moving in a well-defined ascending channel with multiple touch points.  Hence, sustaining above Rs 435 levels it can head to test its upper boundary of the said channel whose value is placed around Rs 497 levels. For time being one can buy the slight dip with a stop-loss below Rs 435 and look for a target of Rs 495.

However, the lender is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing industry consolidation,&quot; Sachs said.  CLSA  CLSA has kept a buy rating on the stock with a target at Rs 1,080 per share as the results were strong across the board with 6.9% on-quarter loan growth and 17% on-year rise in net interest income.  The core PPoP (pre-provision operating profit) was up 8.4% on year in line with estimates due to a further spike in opex.  The improving liability and asset momentum is a positive, while valuation is undemanding for clear RoE (return on equity) visibility of 15-16%.  The bank is amongst the top picks and a part of the India focus portfolio.  Credit Suisse  The broking house has kept an outperform call with a target price at Rs 960 as growth and asset quality beat estimates even as opex dragged operating profits.  The broking house continues to expect 15% ROE in FY23/24.  Nomura  The broking firm has kept a buy call with a target at Rs 980 as NIM (net interest margin) and asset quality improved.  The liability franchise continues to scale up, Nomura said.  Motilal Oswal  Axis Bank delivered a strong operating performance, led by robust loan growth, higher margin, and controlled provisions. Asset quality improved sharply, aided by controlled slippages and higher recoveries and upgrades.  Restructured loans were in control, while a higher provisioning buffer provided comfort.  &quot;We expect slippages to remain in control, enabling a sustained improvement in credit costs,&quot; Motilal said.  &quot;We estimate Axis Bank to deliver FY24E RoA/RoE (return on asset) of 1.6%/16% in FY24E. We maintain our buy rating with a target price of Rs 975/share (2x Sep’23E ABV+ INR134 from its subsidiaries).&quot;  Sharekhan  &quot;We believe its valuations are reasonable and there is potential for re-rating as we expect strong growth. With strong performance on all parameters – loan book, operating performance, and improvement in asset quality -- the bank is poised for robust growth going ahead,&quot; Sharekhan said.  &quot;We expect its credit cost to normalise and deliver RoA of 1.5% in FY2023E.

The Sensex rallied nearly 887 points to close at 57,634, and the Nifty surged 264 points to end at 17,177, getting support from every sector.  Nifty bank, financial services and realty indices gained more than 2 percent each ahead of December 8 interest rate decision of the Monetary Policy Committee. Metal was the biggest gainer among sectors, rising 3 percent. IT, FMCG and auto gained 1-1.6 percent.  The broader markets also participated in the run, with the Nifty midcap 100 and smallcap 100 indices climbing over a percent each.  Stocks that were in focus included Axis Bank, which was the third biggest gainer in the Nifty50, rising 3.6 percent to close at Rs 687. National Aluminium Company (NALCO) was the top gainer in the futures &amp;amp; options segment, closing 7.10 percent higher to Rs 96.6.  Torrent Pharmaceuticals was also in action, registering 4.69 percent gains at Rs 3,074.60. Ramky Infrastructure gained momentum after several months of consolidation, freezing at 20 percent gains to close at Rs 210.05.  Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Axis Bank  The tradable bottom seems to be in place in this counter as it registered a higher top and higher bottom kind of bullish sequence.  This stock, however, is trading way below its 200-day exponential moving average whose value is placed around Rs 722.  Hence, sustaining above 670 levels should be the test of the 200-day moving average. Therefore, traders can hold on to their long positions and can also initiate fresh longs placing a stop below Rs 669 and look for a target placed around Rs 720.  &amp;nbsp;  NALCO  This counter appears to have made a decent base in the last couple of trading sessions and seems to have embarked on a decent pullback rally on huge volumes. If it sustains above Rs 92, it can initially head to test its interim top of Rs 104.  On a decisive close above that, a higher target of Rs 118 can't be ruled out. Therefore, positional traders should buy into this counter with a stop loss below Rs 92 and look for an initial target of Rs 104.    Torrent Pharmaceuticals  Despite this counter witnessing a sharp spike on the back of relatively higher volumes, the larger trend seems to be sideways. For a sustainable upswing, the stock needs a fresh breakout on a close above Rs 3,250.  However, traders who already own this counter can hold for a target of Rs 3,240, whereas fresh buying should be considered only on a dip into the zone of Rs 3,000–Rs 2,950 with the stop loss below Rs 2,930.    Ramky Infrastructure  After a prolonged underperformance —since its lifetime high of Rs 471 in the year 2010—this counter seems to have embarked on a medium-term uptrend. However, it needs to sustain above Rs 210, which seems to be a critical hurdle on long-term charts.  Moreover, this counter may remain vulnerable to profit-booking as it swiftly moved from the lows of Rs 146 in the last four trading sessions. If it consistently trades above Rs 210, eventually a higher target of Rs 270 can be expected.  For the time, fresh buying should be considered only on a dip between Rs 190 and 180 levels by placing a stop below Rs 175 on a closing basis.

Speaking at Mumbai Micro Experience of FinTech Festival India 2021-22, Singhal said, “We cannot be the late movers in accepting crypto. We already missed the first bus of Internet 1.0. Today 70 percent of our revenues go to US-based tech giants. We are a net importer of technology. We import over $10 billion of this technology every year and it is expected to grow to $45-30 billion over the next 3-4 years.”  Early participation in cryptocurrencies could give India the chance to become a net exporter of crypto and blockchain technology, Singhal added.  Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, Member of the Governing Council of RBI Innovation Hub and Board of Supervision of NABARD and Member of Insurance Advisory Council of India, voiced concerns that RBI has around cryptocurrencies.  “RBI’s apprehension regarding cryptocurrency is emanating because the three critical things, entry barriers, supervisory framework, and cross border aspect are not getting translated into the crypto world,&quot; Mahapatra said.  RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has repeatedly said that the regulator has concerns around cryptocurrencies and the same has been conveyed to the Centre. Das had recently said that there was a need for deeper discussions on cryptos.  According to Mahapatra, “Systemic risk and the psychological risk of denting the political stability and social stability because of economic instability even if it is the minutest are creating concerns in the minds of the policymakers.”  Acceptance and regulation of cryptocurrencies can have a cascading effect on various facets of the economy, including banks as the meaning of investing is changing rapidly.  Speaking from a banker’s perspective, Saugata Bhattacharya - Executive Vice-President &amp;amp; Chief Economist at Axis Bank, said, “If an environment of cryptocurrencies including global central bank digital currencies begin to evolve then there are multiple implications for banks, some good and some bad. They need to be aware and need to design their systems in place for this technological shift.”  The past few days saw chaos in the crypto world after the Centre released a list of bills to be tabled in the Winter Session of the Parliament that is set to begin on November 29. The crypto bill, named ‘Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021’ is part of the list.  Industry experts and lawyers expect that cryptocurrencies will be regulated and there will be no blanket ban. The regulations are expected to ensure better monitoring of crypto transactions and guidelines around penalties for fraudulent activities might be framed. However, clarity is awaited on how crypto assets and related services will be taxed.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/india-cannot-risk-being-a-late-mover-in-accepting-crypto-coinswitchs-ashish-singhal-7763171.html

Growth disappointed again, but asset quality trends were better vs. peers. GNPA ratio was down 32bps qoq at 3.5%, while restructured pool stood at 0.64% (+31bps qoq) of loans. Credit growth remains an irritant (+10% yoy), lagging peers like ICICI (17%)/HDFCB/KMB (15%). However, Axis expects to improve the growth trajectory with the help of retail/SME businesses and a gradual pickup in large corporates. NIM too remains an irritant, but Axis pins hope on better growth/change in the product mix and declining PSL drag. We believe the bank has undergone a major transformational journey in the past few years, fortifying the balance sheet, building strong capital/provision buffers and revving up the digital banking platform and even the subsidiaries. Outlook However, it will have to deliver on growth/core-profitability to re-rate from hereon. Factoring in slower-than-expected growth/NIMs, we trim our earnings estimates for FY22-24 by 1-3%.

However, IT, pharma, PSU bank and FMCG stocks offered support.  The Nifty50 shed 57 points to close at 18,211 mark, and The BSE Sensex was down 207 points at 61,143.33, while the broader markets outpaced frontliners as the Nifty Midcap 100 index rose 0.08 percent and Smallcap 100 index gained 0.27 percent.  Stocks that were in focus include Asian Paints, which rallied 4.2 percent to close at Rs 3,094.65 and was the biggest gainer in the BSE Sensex after a price hike of products. Godrej Consumer Products continued its run for the second consecutive session, rising 4.76 percent to Rs 1,009.90, which was the second biggest gainer in the F&amp;amp;O segment.  Private sector lender Axis Bank was the biggest loser in the BSE Sensex and F&amp;amp;O segment, falling 6.46 percent to close at Rs 787.50 after the September quarter earnings.  Here's what Gaurav Sharma of Globe Capital Markets, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Asian Paints  The stock is bouncing back after testing its 200 EMA (exponential moving average) placed around Rs 2,856 levels. This is a positive sign as that moving average will limit its downside movement.  Overall, the stock is in a strong uptrend and is now available after some profit-taking from higher levels. This provides good opportunity for investors to accumulate the stock.  The ongoing festive season is also a positive and will impact its next quarterly numbers. Hence, we advocate taking long positions for an immediate target of Rs 3,400, while Rs 3,700-plus is also a reasonable target for the medium to long term.  Godrej Consumer Products  This stock has underperformed the benchmark in the recent past, which is not an exception as the majority of FMCG stocks saw profit-taking in the past couple of weeks, especially after Hindustan Uniliver's numbers. Technically, this profit-taking should be considered a healthy sign as it gives traders an opportunity to take fresh long positions.  We see the stock heading towards Rs 1,060-1,120 levels in the immediate near term. Sustenance above that mark will open the gates for a further up move till Rs 1,200 and beyond. Traders are advised to keep a stop loss below Rs 900.  Axis Bank  On October 27, the stock witnessed steep selloff, which was a reaction after the quarterly numbers were announced. Prior to this, it was in a strong up trend, poised to scale higher. We still see the bullish trend intact till Rs 720 is held on the downside.  Hence, medium to long term traders are advised to utilise the ongoing profit-taking to accumulate the stock for targets close to Rs 1,000.

Axis Bank on October 26 reported a healthy 86.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone profit at Rs 3,133.32 crore (Q2FY22) for the quarter ended September 30,2021 following a significant fall in provisions. Profit in the year-ago quarter stood at Rs 1,682.67 crore.  Net interest income (NII), the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 7.8 percent to Rs 7,900 crore compared to the corresponding period of the last fiscal, with a 10 percent growth in the loan book.  Net interest margin (NIM) contracted to 3.39 percent in the quarter, compared to 3.46 percent in the June quarter and 3.58 percent in the September 2020 quarter.

It has touched an intraday high of Rs 842.20 and an intraday low of Rs 805.15.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company following the second-quarter earnings:  CLSA: Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,080  The bank posted strong asset quality but weak pre-provision operating profit (PPoP). The research firm has cut PPoP estimates by 2-4 percent but has kept profit estimates unchanged. The bank has lagged peers on loan and PPoP growth, it said.  Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,000  The research firm said asset quality was strong, which reflected in lower slippages and credit costs. Profit, however, missed estimates owing to lower PPoP. It has reduced PPoP estimates for the near-term but expects an improvement over the next two-three years.  Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target raised to Rs 1,020 from Rs 910  The global research firm is of the view that Q2 profit was ahead of estimates aided by lower credit cost, adding that moderation in slippage and low restructuring was positive.  The bank's loan growth slowed as pick-up in retail and SME was offset by a fall in corporate loans. NIM was below that of peers and closing the gap could take time.  ICICI Securities | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 842  Axis Bank’s earnings surprised positively on portfolio quality despite elevated slippage recoveries, upgrades pulled GNPAs down 32bps QoQ to 3.53 percent, restructuring at mere 0.64 percent and credit cost contained at 1.4 percent (better than our estimate of 1.7 percent) reinforces adequacy of the existing buffer.  However, this was offset by growth momentum lagging peers, portfolio mix shift weighing further on NIMs and operating cost being elevated with 36 percent YoY/17 percent QoQ growth.  Moderating credit cost trend is encouraging and now growth acceleration, coupled with NIM improvement, would be critical triggers to deliver superior RoEs. We expect earnings CAGR of higher than 58 percent over FY21-FY23E and RoE of more than 14 percent by FY23E.  We maintain “buy” with a revised target price of Rs 992 from Rs 942, assigning 2.4x FY23 book.  Key risks include lower than anticipated growth that can cap RoE improvement and also elevated opex.

However, new users will be taken on board on an invite-only basis.  Founded in 2019, Jupiter is a digital banking platform that allows users to open a bank account digitally, provides Visa debit cards and insights on spends by customers. The startup does not have a banking licence itself and operates in partnership with Federal Bank and Axis Bank.  Existing users can invite their acquaintances, others can request the existing community for access or try getting one of the limited invites on the app. The startup’s focus is salaried individuals in the age group of 18 to 35 years.  The platform aims to have one million users and add lending and deposit products in the next six months. Currently, 200,000 people have opened accounts and another 3,000 users are opening savings accounts every day on the app that saw over 1 billion deposit transactions in the last 30 days, the startup said.  “We are like a bank, so the basic expectation of a consumer from a bank is that we should have a deposit product and a lending product. These two are our immediate priorities and we will keep adding features on both these products,” said Gupta in an interaction with Moneycontrol.  The startup, which possesses a non-banking financial company (NBFC) licence, plans to lend only to customers who are bank account holders through the platform. While the product is still months away from being launched, the credit requirements of these customers are expected to be in the range of Rs 10,000 to as high as Rs 3 lakh.  Jupiter plans to do the risk assessment and underwriting for these loans with its in-house team as well as using credit bureau scores. The company also has its Bullet product which allows customers to make all UPI-based payments in one go with a 15-day billing cycle.  Neobanks are a growing tribe with players like Open, RazorpayX, EpiFi, and Niyo competing with Jupiter. However, Gupta does not see this as a challenge.  “There are over 50 mainstream banks in India and all of those are doing very well on the retail side. If they all can do well, I am sure 10 neobanks can do well, too. So the market opportunity is very big,” Gupta said.  Jupiter is Gupta’s second startup after CitrusPay, which he sold to Naspers-owned PayU in 2016 in a $130-million deal and was recorded as one of the largest exits in the Indian fintech services ecosystem at the time.  In its last Series B funding round, Jupiter had raised $44 million led by Brazil’s Nubank Global Founders Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Matrix Partners India. The round was supplemented with a $10 million raise from US-based QED Investors.  The funding was done in a year that saw a boom in investments in the Indian startup space at every stage, leading to ballooning valuations. With a total of over $70 million raised until now, Gupta said the startup is adequately funded for the next two to three years.  “The market is crazy right now. There are all kinds of investors available in the world who want to figure out where to deploy their money. Raising money in this market is not a challenge, but we still have more than half of our first-round funding in the bank,” he explained.  Gupta had raised $25 million in a Series A round from investors like Sequoia, Matrix Partners, 3one4 Capital, former Tiger Global head honcho Lee Fixel and others while Jupiter was still in stealth mode.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/neobank-jupiter-opens-up-platform-for-more-users-to-look-at-lending-next-7625661.html

axis,2021-09-30T07:20:58+05:30,Ishan Shah," With Axis Bank's know-how and reach, Max Life will be on a journey of multi-year expeditious growth: Max...","The opportunities of synergies with Axis Bank are humongous. says, Prashant Tripathy. Digital, he says, is a big play for Max Life, and currently, the organisation is on a multi-year programme to completely digitise its operations and sales.","The life insurance industry saw strong growth in August, especially by private life insurers. Increased awareness around protection, importance of insurance and under-penetration, and the growth momentum for the life insurance industry is expected to continue.  To understand how the industry is performing and how Max Life Insurance is placed, Prashant Tripathy, MD &amp;amp; CEO of Max Life Insurance, in a exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol, talks about the industry dynamics, the deal with Axis Bank and the outcomes expected. He also touched upon the company's product and distribution mix, COVID impact on pricing and the roadmap ahead for Max Life Insurance. Edited Excerpts:  How’s the industry outlook, considering we are halfway of FY22? How was H1 and how do you see H2?  The industry is doing well and H1 numbers will come out in a few days. In Q1, the private life insurance industry grew at more than 20 percent, and Max Life grew around 34 percent.  The need for life insurance has been well understood one more time through the pandemic period. The momentum continued in July and August also. Even in September, we might see an expeditious growth.  The industry is in a healthy shape and most players are recording impressive growth. Overall, the industry is in full momentum. Of course, there’s a base effect due to the lockdown in the first half of FY21. I wouldn’t be surprised if growth in H2 remains pretty robust. It may be a bit lower now, but we are still expecting a robust growth rate in the second half of FY22.  As the awareness around importance of protection has gone up, how is your product mix looking like?  We have always believed in a balanced product mix. We don’t put all eggs in one basket. We have maintained that trajectory. There’s equal focus on all categories. We have always believed in selling traditional plans.  In the last one quarter, our overall traditional plans, including par and non-par and protection products, would be 65 percent and the remaining 35 percent has been ULIPs.  Within traditional, the categories which are doing well are the non-participating savings plans. During times of uncertainty, people tend to gravitate towards certain outcomes and that’s doing well.  Protection policies are not as strong as last year, predominantly because of COVID, as underwriting norms are still restricted. We are still doing reasonably good business.  As the dust settles on COVID and related fears, protection is going to be a bet for the long term and going to be a strategic area for us.  This year, we have also started to bet on driving retirement annuity sales and we are seeing very robust growth. Overall, the product mix is balanced.  In the second half, we have a slew of new products planned in areas of par, non-par, ULIP, etc. In the first half of FY22, we focused on protection, annuity and riders. By the year-end, we will have new products across all areas.  How’s the outlook on the Axis Bank deal?  Our relationship with Axis Bank is more than 11 years. This year is special as, apart from being the largest distribution partner, they have also become our shareholder. Max Life is now a joint venture between Max Financial and Axis Bank.  It’s a milestone event. It has given enough strength to Max Life Insurance. Having an association and parenthood with a large financial institution is a matter of strength. With their know-how and vast reach, Max Life will be on a journey of multi-year expeditious growth.  The hunger to expand at Max Life has multiplied manifold and we are very open to new relationships. It could be in the areas of organic and inorganic, we would be looking out for areas for growth.  When we talk about organic, we will focus on all elements like banks, small finance banks, fintechs and ecosystem-based growth.  The opportunities of synergies with Axis Bank are humongous. There is a sea change in the relationship. Earlier, it was a distribution relationship, now they have participation in our board. We have frequent meetings with them, and we will work through product designs and marketing efforts, making sure the size is leveraged. The list is endless when two large organisations come together.  Any specific area you would want to strengthen by means of inorganic growth opportunities?  Our bias is to have or acquire complementary skills. It could be in the area of bringing in distribution through banks or a strong agency. It will be in the area of bringing in new skills or geographical presence.  We have our minds open. We are very open to reviewing. At the same time, there will be a bias to look at complementary skills and not just go ahead and acquire.  How is your distribution mix and road ahead to strengthen it?  In the last one year, the contribution of bancassurance went up, predominantly because they were better placed.  On an ongoing basis, little over two-thirds is from banks, and close to one-third is our own distribution. Within our own, a large part comes from agencies, but we have also experimented and proved certain models through our own sales force.  We have registered strong growth in our protection business through digital sales, across counters like aggregators, our own channels etc. We are the number one sellers of protection through digital e-commerce.  While our overall market share is a little over 10 percent, our market share in the digital space is close to 30 percent. Every one out of three customers, when they buy protection products through digital means or directly through e-commerce, that comes from Max Life Insurance.  In the long term, the focus will be on our channels. One of the big task in the next five years is to grow our own channels considerably, and internet or e-commerce channels.  Any new areas you would want to touch upon?  We are going to focus on two segments. One will be in the area of protection – health and wellbeing. Here, we are looking at the entire ecosystem over and above term plans. We came up with riders and wearables, where the new premium could get a discount based on the health consciousness of people.  The other strategic segment is retirement. The retirement market is going to be very, very large, and the way it is currently set up, there will be new opportunities, not in terms of accumulation but in the overall retirement space. We were recently allotted the NPS fund management licence by PFRDA, and we are slowly going to build the retirement business as we move along.  What sort of remodelling and reassessment have you all gone through? Impact on pricing?  It is a question of balancing three things – customer needs, pricing and margins. It needs to be balanced with mortality experience. The good part is that Max Life has done a good job in maintaining these vectors and we will be competitive.  COVID did spike up claims. The good part is that the trend is settling down every passing month, with July being the peak month, and it tapered down in August and September.  I hope that, by year end, it will stabilise, if there’s no third wave. Hence, I’m very optimistic, collectively with our reinsurance partner, we will be able to come up with pricing solutions which take into account both short-term as well as long-term mortality.  The pricing trends are generally upwards. This is how it is expected to be. In a few months, we will know how high it will be. Protection prices in India are still one of the cheapest in the world.  Keeping all three things in mind, customer, price sensitivity and margins, we will take a call which will balance all the three.  Any upper band?  We are competitively priced. We will have some discussions with our reinsurers in the absence of how those rates are moving. It’s hard to say but I’m not anticipating a huge increase. It may be a marginal increase.  How is Max Life approaching digitisation?  We are approaching digitisation in a comprehensive manner, looking at vertical as well as horizontals. The elements of prospecting, onboarding and customer service are going through transformational changes.  Across all channels, 100 percent policies come to us digitally. It gets underwritten through AI/ML-based solutions, which immediately make the decision and that process has been 100 percent digitised.  We have about 85 percent of customer queries coming to us through digital means and getting responded digitally. All the recruitment, and we are a big recruiter of agent-advisors, happens digitally.  The effort is to be a comprehensive digital organisation. We have now two rounds of accelerator programmes, where we ask fintech companies to solve some of our problems, which could be related to onboarding, underwriting, analytics, customer service, etc. This helps our team also to learn and continuously evolve.  Digital is a big play for us, whether in Axis Bank or our own agency. Currently, we are on a multi-year programme to completely digitise our operations and sales.  Growth estimate for FY22?  The target will be to repeat last year’s performance or do better. It is hard to pinpoint a number at this point of time. The first half is lighter than second half. A big part of sales is yet to unfold.  At this point, I’m looking at growth rates, which is upwards of 20 percent. We will definitely target a number, which is upwards of 20 percent.  The fund size of Max Life has moved from Rs 4,700 crore to Rs 100,000 crore now. We recently crossed this milestone. It has been growing at 30 percent CAGR in the last one decade. That’s a reflection of business growth, and a big driver of that has been healthy persistency.  With the Axis Bank partnership taking a new dimension, the business is poised to take the next leap and we are working to create a platform and framework for that growth.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/with-axis-banks-know-how-and-reach-max-life-will-be-on-a-journey-of-multi-year-expeditious-growth-max-life-md-ceo-7524361.html

These commitments are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), supporting India’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.  &quot;As part of its commitments, the bank has set a target of incremental lending of Rs 30,000 crore over the next 5 years, under wholesale banking towards pertinent sectors included in its Sustainable Financing Framework (SFF),&quot; Rajesh Dahiya, Executive Director (Corporate Centre), Axis Bank told PTI.  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) is a measure which investors use as a tool to assess how good the practices of a company are. For the last 3-4 years, the words sustainability and ESG have made people sensitive about the whole idea of a sustainable planet, Dahiya said.  &quot;These are the metrics which have been spoken about for about 3-4 years now. However, with COVID and all its problems, it highlighted the issue of sustainability in a very big and magnified manner.&quot;  &quot;In the next five years, we want to lend Rs 30,000 crore more incrementally as wholesale banking towards pertinent sectors including Axis Bank's SFF. We want to increase our portfolio of green lending,&quot; Dahiya said.  He said the bank's existing wholesale banking portfolio towards SFF, including green and social sectors, is little over Rs 29,000 crore and it intends to lend to companies where there are green practices.  After five years till 2025-26, the bank will assess these lendings to see positive social and environmental outcomes and increase it further, he added.  Going forward, the lender will also scale down its exposure to carbon-intensive sectors in its wholesale banking business portfolio.  The lender said it is expanding its ESG risk coverage in credit appraisal under its ESG policy for lending.  Axis Bank is building and deploying an ESG risk assessment toolkit, with ESG stress testing and ESG scenario analysis, for its large corporate, SME and agri-business verticals by 2022-23.  The lender will incentivise the borrowers for adopting good practices by offering 0.5 per cent interest waiver on new electric vehicle loans, effective immediately.  &quot;We will make 5 per cent of our retail two-wheeler loan portfolio as electric by 2023-24 ,&quot; he said.  Besides, the bank has set the target of incremental disbursement of Rs 10,000 crore by 2023-24 under Asha Home Loans for affordable housing, and increasing share of women borrowers.  Also, the bank will aim to reach 30 per cent female representation in its workforce by 2026-27, aligned to its #ComeAsYouAre Diversity Charter.  Among others, it will plant 2 million (20 lakh) trees by 2026-27 across India towards contributing to creating a carbon sink.  Dahiya said Axis Bank is probably the first among corporates to constitute an ESG Steering Committee comprising heads of key departments who shall act as ESG champions within and outside the bank.  &quot;Since the day COVID hit, our board got us together and decided...we want to create a practice which is differentiated and which is measurable,&quot; he added.

axis,2021-09-02T14:40:19+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,"Explained: AT1 bonds, their risks, rewards and why banks issue them",Additional Tier 1 bonds do not have a maturity date and are perpetual in nature. These debt instruments offer higher returns to investors but they also carry a higher risk.   ,"Additional Tier 1 bonds or AT1 bonds are back in the news with a clutch of banks rushing to raise funds by tapping this market. Among the lenders that have recently raised funds through AT1 Bond issues are State Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank and HDFC Bank. The coupon rate on these bonds differs as per market conditions. Why do banks use these instruments? What are the benefits and risks for investors? Here is a primer:  What are AT1 bonds?  AT1 bonds, as these instruments are popularly known, are a type of perpetual debt instrument that banks use to augment their core equity base and thus comply with Basel III norms. These bonds were introduced by the Basel accord after the global financial crisis to protect depositors.  How are these bonds different from other debt instruments?  These bonds are perpetual in nature — they do not carry any maturity date. They offer higher returns to investors but compared with other vanilla debt products, these instruments carry a higher risk as well. If the capital ratios of the issuer fall below a certain percentage or in the event of an institutional failure, the rules allow the issuer to stop paying interest or even write down these bonds, as happened in the Yes Bank case. These bonds are subordinate to all other debt and senior only to equity.  What can investors do with AT1 bonds?  As mentioned above, AT1 bonds do not have a maturity date. Banks have a call option that permits them to redeem these bonds after a certain period.  Are they safe for investors?  Since these bonds can be written down by banks under the directions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the event of an institutional failure, they are seen as high-risk instruments. If the bank reaches the point of non-viability, AT1 bonds are the first part of debt that will be written down. AT1 bonds worth Rs 8,414 crore were written off fully during the Yes Bank reconstruction scheme in March 2020. Those AT1 investors are still locked in a court battle with the RBI and the bank seeking the return of their investments. In this backdrop, it is fair to say that AT1 bonds are high-risk instruments for investors, especially retail investors.  Why do the banks tap the AT1 bond route?  Banks periodically raise money issuing such bonds. At one point, lenders used to even pitch these to retail investors as an attractive option, often with returns higher than a traditional fixed deposit would offer. Indeed, there used to be significant retail interest in AT1 bonds till the Yes Bank episode.  The market for AT1 bonds took a hit after the Yes Bank write-off, as part of the State Bank of India-led bailout in March 2020. Investors have begun to look at these instruments with caution since then.  Which banks have taken the AT1 Bond route to raise funds recently?  State Bank of India (SBI) and Axis Bank are the lenders to have most recently raised money through AT1 bonds. Axis Bank recently raised $600 million through an AT1 Bond issue, while State Bank of India announced on September 1 that it had raised Rs 4,000 crore of the Basel-compliant bonds. The country’s largest lender raised the amount at a coupon rate of 7.72 percent. In August, HDFC Bank, too, raised $1 billion by selling AT1 bonds to overseas investors.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/explained-at1-bonds-their-risks-rewards-and-why-banks-issue-them-7420691.html

","A debt-ridden branch manager of Axis bank has been sacked after he tried to loot an ICICI bank branch, stabbing the deputy branch head to death. The Axis bank manager attempted to flee but was caught by the locals, police informed on July 30.  &quot;The prime accused Anil Dubey -- the Naigaon Axis Bank Branch Manager, who is a former employee and ex-manager of the ICICI Bank, has been arrested. There is no other person involved as of now,&quot; Virar Police Station Senior Police Inspector Suresh Warade told IANS.  The incident took place around the evening of July 29, after ICICI Bank's Virar East Branch, Mumbai was closed. Most staffers had left for the day, barring two women employees- Deputy Manager Yogita Nishant Choudhary and her cashier colleague Shraddha Devrukhkar.  Dubey drove down from Naigaon to the ICICI Bank Virar East branch, stepped inside, whipped out a sharp weapon and threatened  Choudhary and Devrukhkar, reported IANS.  He ordered them to hand over all the cash and jewellery which he then dumped into a bag and attempted to flee the scene of crime. However both the women started screaming for help and attempted to pin down Dubey who retaliated by attacking them both with the knife several times before breaking free to run out.  By then, a few people from neighbouring shops had gathered who managed to grab hold of Dubey, took the booty-filled bag and kept it in the ATM cabin and summoned the police.  The knife had wounded both the women badly. Devrukhkar, 32, who was hit in the neck and shoulder, is undergoing treatment at a local hospital, informed Inspector Warade. Unfortunately, the other colleague suffered gashes in the throat, shoulder and other parts of her body and succumbed to her injuries eventually.  According to Warade, the accused Dubey had ostensibly run up huge debts of over Rs 1 crore and may have resorted to the shocking heist to clear off his dues, reported IANS.  Axis Bank has taken the matter very seriously and along with sacking Dubey has launched an internal probe into the matter.  &quot;As a responsible institution, Axis Bank has zero-tolerance towards unscrupulous elements and is committed to fully cooperate with the relevant authorities in resolving this issue.

The brokerage firm expects strong future earnings from lower credit cost and better PPoP.   Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Accumulate | Target: Rs 860 | The bank’s slippages of around Rs 60 billion+ have been on the higher side and should start subsiding materially in 2HFY22. PCR of 69%, better growth and tech initiatives should reflect in the balance sheet ahead.   Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 925 | According to the brokerage, though slippages could remain elevated in the near term, healthy PCR of around  70%, coupled with additional provisions buffer of 2%, would likely protect the balance sheet against any potential stress. It expects credit cost to moderate to 1.5%/1.3% over FY22E/FY23E. Motilal Oswal largely maintains its earnings estimate for FY22E/FY23E and expects the bank to deliver a RoA/RoE of 1.6%/15.2% in FY23E.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/photos/business/stocks/axis-bank-q1-profit-jumps-94-to-rs-2160-crore-check-what-brokerages-have-to-say-7228761.html

axis,2021-07-20T08:58:02+05:30,Hiral Thanawala," Axis Bank acquires Citibank’s credit card business: Should you continue using your card, will your...","It’s important you migrate to a credit card that has equal or better rewards and offers. Also, your credit limit should remain the same or improve","On Wednesday, March 30, Axis Bank has announced it acquires Citibank's India consumer banking business which comprises credit cards, home loans and retail banking. The deal comes almost a year after, Citigroup had announced that it will shutter its retail banking operations in 13 countries including India as part of a global business strategy.  Let’s decode the most common questions of Citi credit card customers pertaining to reward points, dues and more.  Should I continue holding the Citi credit card after the announcement that Axis Bank is acquiring the credit card business?  Do not rush to surrender the Citi credit card right away after this announcement. “Axis bank is a significant player in the credit card segment and has a good credibility in the market. Wait until the migrating offer from the Axis Bank to existing Citi credit card customers,” says Parijat Garg, a digital lending consultant. He adds, you can plan to exit after evaluating the offer from Axis Bank. Anyone who has Axis bank credit card right now and also a Citi bank credit card. They should evaluate which card is better for them and continue with one. You may not like to hold two credit cards with similar benefits in your wallet.  Assume a customer is using a Citi IndianOil Credit Card or Citi Gold credit card. “It will be interesting to see how it will get mapped to AXIS bank credit card as they also have a separate set of credit cards,” says Garg. He adds, it’s important you migrate to a credit card that has equal or better rewards and offers. Also, your credit limit should remain the same or improve. Then it makes sense for Citi credit card customers to continue with Axis Bank.  Will Axis Bank devalue Citi reward points during acquisition?  No, Axis Bank will not devalue reward points while acquiring. “The customers will have better terms and offers, a wider set of services. We believe we can match those offers and retain it that’s guaranteed for any customer who is coming over as part of this transaction,” says Subrat Mohanty, Group Executive – Banking Operations &amp;amp; Transformation of Axis Bank.  Also read: Want to use your credit card wisely? Stick to these spending and repaying rules  I have an ongoing dispute with the Citi credit card related to an outstanding amount. What I should do now?  If you have some disputes related to an outstanding amount or late payment charges with Citi bank, then clear them while it is still in operations in India and make sure your credit history is clean. Once Citibank exits its India retail business, i.e. after this acquisition gets over in six to nine months, getting a resolution to your card complaints might be difficult and time-consuming. “An unresolved dispute may also reflect in your credit report. In future, there could be challenges while applying for a loan,” says Garg.  Will Citi’s exit impact my credit score?  No, there won’t be any impact on your credit history, if you exit from Citi bank's credit card or you are transferred to the acquiring bank. “The credit history travels with you and it’s not linked to a particular organisation,” says a spokesperson from www.creditcardz.in.  What parameters should I evaluate to decide whether to continue with the credit card or exit?  The Citi reward points do not expire. But, Axis bank may set some expiry date for your points, depending on the type of card. Ajay Awtaney, editor of LifeFromALounge.com, says, “When you are transferred to the acquiring bank, you must evaluate the acquirer's history and experience in the credit cards segment, whether existing benefits will be continued.”  Also read: All about what you should do with travel credit cards now  The credit limits offered by Citibank on credit cards are much higher compared to most of the banks. Will there be a re-look on those limits now by Axis Bank?  Mohanty says that the credit limits of all Citi customers are most likely to remain the same. “The limit on credit cards is determined by the quality of the customer. So, it’s not always comparable,” says Mohanty. But he adds that the bank has done its due diligence and has &quot;fairly done a detailed understanding and analysis of Citi's customers. So, existing credit limits will continue.&quot;  But, if you have a poor credit history during this transition period, there is a possibility that Axis bank will lower your credit limit.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/have-a-citibank-credit-card-heres-what-you-must-do-now-7194831.html

Check out all the changes here:  As Syndicate and Canara bank merge, the customers of Syndicate bank will be given new IFSC codes for functioning effectively today. All IFSC codes starting with SYNB will be deactivated starting today. For the uninitiated, the IFSC (Indian Financial System Code) is a unique, 11 digit alpha-numeric code that identifies a bank branch for online fund transfers. The first four characters are representative of the bank name, the fifth character is zero, and the remaining digits signify the branch.  Customers will be required to use new cheque books provided by Union Bank from 1st July, which amalgamated Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank on 1st April 2020 under the mega-merger of public sector banks undertaken by the Finance Ministry last year. All cheque books issued by both of these banks will no longer be functional.  IDBI Bank has revised its cheque leaf charges. Earlier, the bank offered 50 free leaves per quarter and levied Rs 3 per leaf post the limit. Now, the customers will have a ceiling of 20 free leaves per year, with a charge of Rs 5 per leaf post the stipulated limit. However, it is noteworthy that the IDBI “Sabka Savings Account” does not fall under this change.  In addition to increasing cash withdrawal charges from ATMs beyond the free limit of 5 transactions, Axis Bank has also raised the minimum balance threshold for savings accounts. Earlier, the withdrawal charges stood at Rs 5/1,000 or Rs 150, whichever was higher. Now the effective charges beyond the free limit will be Rs 10/1,000 or Rs 150, whichever is higher.  The minimum balance requirement for Easy Savings Scheme, in metro locations particularly, has been raised from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. The bank also hiked its SMS charges, with the SMS alert free effective from today standing at 25 paise per SMS, with a maximum limit of Rs 25/month. This was earlier set at Rs 5/month for value-added service alerts. However, OTP and promotional messages sent by the bank will not count under these charges.  The country’s biggest lender SBI (State Bank of India) also introduced a change in charges levied. Beyond the stipulated 4 free transactions, the bank will levy a charge of Rs 15 plus GST per cash withdrawal from ATMs (both SBI and Non-SBI) or its branches.  Additionally, SBI will supply 10 free cheque leaves per financial year to its BSBD (Basic Savings Bank Deposits) or Zero Balance account holders. Barring senior citizens, the charges that will be levied on cheque leaves thereon would be as follows:  A 10 leaf checkbook will cost Rs 40 plus GST charges, while a 25 leaf cheque book will be charged at Rs 75 plus GST. If you wish to apply for an emergency checkbook, you will have to pay Rs 50+ GST for 10 leaves. However, there will be no charges on non-financial and transfer transactions by BSBD account holders, both through the bank branch and its alternate channels.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/sbi-axis-idbi-bank-revise-charges-from-today-check-now-7112511.html

The bank is giving its debit and credit card holders a flat 15 percent cashback on partner e-commerce portals like Flipkart and Amazon as part of the ten-day &quot;Grab Deals Fest&quot; which is on till July 4.  “We are witnessing a 10x jump in overall spends by gross merchandise value (GMV) if I were to compare it with daily average in the month prior to launch and almost similar increase in the number of customers who are availing the offer,” its president and head of digital business and transformation, Sameer Shetty, told PTI.  It can be noted that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has hit demand across the economy, with many analysts saying that private consumption has fallen in such a way that even staples have been hit. Even as the lockdown measures get eased, they say demand will take time to revive as income generation needs to come back first.  Usually, a lot of the e-commerce sales activity happens around festive season towards the end of the year, and there are reports saying the e-commerce players are expecting a subdued activity this year.  Shetty said the bank is witnessing a surge in ordering from urban areas where e-commerce ordering is active, but stressed that the ordering is across income segments.  The products ordered can largely be called as discretionary items, Shetty said, hinting that the bank's experience cannot be exactly compared with the macro picture because of a slew of factors like a small set of people in the economy it serves and their background.  The bank launched the offer because it thought that the second wave is now receding and people are coming out of stressful times. The lender's main focus is making as many customers avail of the offer rather than look at the GMV, he said, adding that such schemes are aimed at deepening the connect with customers.  The discounts are shared between the bank and the e-commerce major, Shetty said, maintaining that the bank does not want to do big bang shopping festivals and will continue with such deals regularly.  The response to the current offer is “far beyond” expectations, Shetty said, exuding confidence that by the time the offer ends the bank would have done significantly better than what it aimed for initially.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/amid-worries-over-demand-revival-axis-bank-sees-10-times-growth-in-online-shopping-fest-7106991.html

AISPL is a local legal Indian entity that acts as a seller for AWS services in India.  He cited various reports to state that India has the highest fintech adoption in Asia (87 per cent) and that 59 per cent of Indian consumers in metros are willing to move to a digital-only bank in the next two years. &quot;The picture is clear that consumers no longer only expect but they demand personalisation, they demand convenience, and they want an enhanced user experience which is improving every day,&quot; he told reporters.  Talking about the partnership with Axis Bank, Chandok said AWS is helping build a secure foundation for digital at the bank, driving innovation, and migration and core modernisation. He noted that cloud technology is transforming not just the financial industry but other sectors as well.  &quot;Virtually every business segment in India, we are seeing re-invention happening, driven by the cloud. Be it insurance, banking, manufacturing, media and discontinuities like this, push all of us to step back and change,&quot; he added. Financial services customers across banks, insurers and fintechs are increasingly running business critical applications on AWS, where they started their journey with small workloads, but have now moved more business critical applications to the cloud.  Subrat Mohanty, Group Executive at Axis Bank said over the last 18 months, the organisation has been working with a very specific focus on making Axis Bank, the best digital bank in the country. About 73 per cent of its customers are digitally active, 73 per cent of FDs opened are opened digitally and over 800 people are working on digital projects, he added.  &quot;In the course of last six months, we are starting to see the results…about 50 million-plus daily transactions that actually happened on the app. If you see our customer footprint over the last 24 months or so, it has really exploded,&quot; he added. Axis Bank has over 200 million customers who increasingly demand new and innovative digital banking services, including digital deposits, digital loans, and digital credit cards, to better manage their finances.  Last year, Axis Bank made the decision to deploy all new customer facing applications on AWS. While 15 per cent of the bank's applications are already on the cloud currently, the bank aims to take this number to 70 per cent in three years. &quot;We are committed to investing in India and the intent is to put the power of AWS Cloud directly into the hands of our customers and partners, so that they have the tools to really experiment, innovate and deliver impact at scale in India,&quot; Chandok said.  He added that the investments are directed towards strengthening its technical support teams, building capabilities and infrastructure to support its growth in the country. Leveraging AWS' solutions, Axis Bank has built new digital banking products using microservices that support any application architecture, irrespective of scale, load, or complexity.  For example, the bank has built fully digital offerings which include its LEAP savings account with a virtual debit card, its NOVA online current account, and OLIVE, its credit card engagement platform that has serviced more than 3.5 million users since its launch less than two months ago. Using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud, Axis Bank will scale workloads on demand to support 10 million daily real-time payments through India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI).",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/axis-bank-inks-multi-year-deal-with-aws-for-powering-digital-banking-services-7104551.html
axis,2021-06-22T11:23:18+05:30,Nishant Kumar,"Axis Bank stock has jumped 72% in a year, brokerages believe it can rise 35% more",Brokerages believe the stock will rise further as the fundamentals are intact and the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 would be lower than the first wave due to the absence of a moratorium.,"The shares of Axis Bank have logged strong gains in the last year, outperforming the benchmark index Sensex by a significant margin and yet analysts and brokerages believe it has more legs to go in the medium term.  Axis Bank has logged a gain of 72 percent on BSE in the last year against a 51 percent gain in the Sensex. In 2021 so far, the stock is up 19 percent, while the Sensex is up 10 percent.  Brokerages believe the stock will rise further as the fundamentals of the stock are intact and the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 will be lower than the first wave due to the absence of a moratorium.  Global financial firm Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,000, a 35 percent upside from the current market level of Rs 739.65.  &quot;There will be near-term impact owing to the second COVID wave. However, the bank expects to re-accelerate growth across segments as the COVID-related concerns subside,&quot; Morgan Stanley said.  Despite near-term COVID-led disruption, the bank claims to be ready for accelerated growth with a clear focus on RARoC (risk-adjusted return on capital)-based lending, mainly driven by retail/SME, brokerage firm Emkay Global said.  Emkay has a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 960, which is a 30 percent upside from the stock's current market price.  &quot;The bank claims that lower ECLGS (emergency credit line guarantee scheme) disbursement among peers corroborates better-quality SME back-book and plans to re-accelerate growth (partly gaining market share from PSBs). On the corporate front, the focus will be on building granular working capital and mid-corporate book. We build in 15-22 percent growth for FY22-24E,&quot; Emkay said.  &quot;The bank has undergone a major transformational journey, fortified balance-sheet and is now ready to re-accelerate growth, delivering better return ratios (RoA/RoE at 1.5-1.6 percent/15-16 percent in FY23-24E),&quot; said Emkay.  The bank posted a net profit of Rs 2,677 crore for the quarter ended March 2021 following a sharp decline in bad loan provisions. The double-digit growth in net interest income, non-interest income and pre-provision operating profit boosted profitability.  Jyoti Roy, DVP Equity Strategist, Angel Broking, said while there is going to be some impact of the second COVID wave on the asset quality in the first quarter of FY22, Axis Bank holds additional provisioning of 1.9 percent of advances which provides comfort.  &quot;At the current level, Axis Bank is trading at P/ABV of 2.1 times FY22 adjusted book of Rs 357. Given the improvement in asset quality and excess provisioning on the books, we remain positive on Axis Bank, and it is one of our top picks in the large-cap banking space,&quot; Roy said.  While brokerages and analysts are positive on the stock, the road ahead is not free of bumps. While COVID remains a looming risk that could trigger a rise in NPA, the bank's asset performance, too, has been volatile.  &quot;Despite considerable liability increases, Axis' asset performance has been volatile. Overdue retail/SME accounts and the implementation of corporate assets growth is not substantial over last year,&quot; said Ashis Biswas, Head of Technical Research at CapitalVia Global Research, who has a &quot;hold&quot; call on the stock with a target price of Rs 820.  Biswas, however, said the bank's substantial provisioning buffer and lower incremental stress will cushion.  The deposit franchise is gaining traction, and this tactical buffer will help improve the NIM forecast in the future. As a result, NIM is expected to increase in FY22 as the interest income reversal unwinds, he said.

Last Thursday, the stock was locked at 20 percent upper circuit and the rally continued till Friday. However, it witnessed a bit of profit-booking, falling more than half a percent. In the last 12 months, the stock has rallied 35 percent.  On June 4, sources privy to the matter told Moneycontrol that the lender is looking at acquiring Spandana Sphoorty, in an attempt to reduce its priority sector lending (PSL) cost. The interest in this deal has been evinced on both sides, they said.

On the other hand, &quot;the microfinance institution would gain huge support from the parent bank and be able to sail through the tough times, amid pandemic, easier compared to its competitors,&quot; he said.  Investors can hold Spandana Sphoorty with a medium to long term perspective, Garg advised.  In a clarification note to the exchange, Spandana Sphoorty said the company was unaware of the source of Moneycontrol's report, adding that it does not &quot;comment on media speculation.&quot;  The company is primarily engaged in the business of microfinance, providing small value unsecured loans to low-income customers in semi-urban and rural areas.

axis,2021-06-04T17:12:15+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan," Exclusive Interview | This once-in-a-century public health shock has no playbook to follow, says Axis Bank...","RBI’s response since March 2020 has been exceptionally dynamic and proactive, using large surplus system liquidity levels as a significant instrument to anchor short term rates at low levels. ","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on June 4 announced a status quo in its key lending rate at 4 percent and downgraded its FY22 economic growth forecast to 9.5 percent after a three-day, bi-monthly monetary policy committee meeting.  The decision came on the expected lines.  Additionally, the RBI announced a series of liquidity measures including an on-tap liquidity window for contact-intensive sectors. From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, the RBI has announced a series of measures to guard the economy and keep the liquidity conditions comfortable for financial system.  In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Saugata Bhattacharya, Executive Vice President - Business and Economic Research &amp;amp; Chief Economist, Axis Bank spoke on a range of issues including the central bank’s tough fight ahead to keep the growth-inflation trade-off under control:  Edited Excerpts:  Do the GDP growth estimates for FY22 now look more realistic?  RBI’s earlier 10.5 percent FY22 GDP growth forecast had already been quite conservative and at the lower end of economists’ and analysts’ forecasts. The current lowering to 9.5 percent is now more in line with analysts’ post second wave of forecasts. Please note that this is an evolving analysis based on the reductions in infections and easing of lockdowns.  What are the risks?  Predominantly, these relate to the incidence of a third infections wave, and the resulting need for further lockdowns. Given the rising availability of vaccines, these risks are coming down. Also, a combination of high commodities prices, domestic inflation and earlier than expected normalisation of easy monetary policy by global centrals banks can require an early response from MPC and RBI, which can slow down growth recovery momentum.  Do you think RBI should begin unwinding now on the easy liquidity stance?  Given the above forecasts of growth slowdown and resulting loss of incomes, it is important to keep interest rates, particularly lending rates, at reasonably low levels. There are indeed some risks of the current surplus liquidity levels adding to inflationary pressures and unanchored inflation expectations. However, given the likely magnitude and prolonging of weak demand, the benefit of the ample system liquidity far outweigh the risks. However, RBI has shown exceptional ability to anticipate emerging risks, and can calibrate liquidity levels to manage these risks as needed.  Do you think inflation will surprise on the upside this year? Kindly explain.  There is a risk of CPI inflation pushing up higher than RBI’s forecast of 5.1 percent, due to the factors mentioned above, especially high crude prices. However, we think, as the RBI statement emphasises, that the risks are balanced, with the prospects of a normal monsoon keeping food prices in check, and a lack of a sharp increase in aggregate demand coupled with gradually normalising supply dislocations keeping CPI items under controls.  RBI has aggressively focused on liquidity enabling measures. Your view?  RBI’s response since March 2020 has been exceptionally dynamic and proactive, using large surplus system liquidity levels as a significant instrument to anchor short term rates at low levels. This is in line with the response of all major global central banks.  Is the RBI forward guidance losing its credibility?  On the contrary, RBI and MPC’s forward guidance are being even more closely parsed and tracked. RBI had, in its April ’21 review, shifted from a time dependent to a state dependent forward guidance. In today’s statement, it has augmented its commitment to “continue its accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth …”, adding “revival” to its April statement of sustaining growth. For good measure, the statement also added the willingness to “continue to use all instruments at its command”.  Do you think the fiscal response is adequate to complement RBI measures?  A large fiscal counter-cyclical response is certainly warranted to partially offset the economic losses resulting from the second set of lockdowns. The Govt has also demonstrated its willingness to increase the fiscal stimulus both in FY21 and the budgeted expenditures for FY22. As to the timing, the Govt has the kind of data and insights into the nature of the economic scarring from the disruption in economic activity, which will enable to craft a stimulus response better than analysts. We think a large targeted expenditure boost is likely once the restrictions start being relaxed.  How do you assess Shaktikanta Das performance as RBI Governor so far?  Governor Das and his RBI team have been exceptionally innovative and dynamic in anticipating and responding to the evolving economic and market risks, and have had a large role in incentivising credit, maintaining stability in financial and credit markets. This flexibility of response is remarkable, given that this once-in-a-century public health shock has no playbook to follow.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-interview-this-once-in-a-century-public-health-shock-has-no-playbook-to-follow-says-axis-bank-chief-economist-saugata-bhattacharya-6988921.html
