The attacks in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels have disrupted fuel trade, impacting Indian refiners and potentially eroding their competitive edge.","India’s state-run refiners are facing a shift in fortunes as once cheap Russian oil becomes more expensive and less accessible, squeezing profits for companies that had been benefiting from Moscow’s war in Ukraine.Attacks in the Red Sea have driven up freight rates, while tougher US sanctions have stranded some Russian cargoes destined for India, adding to costs. That may force some processors to buy more pricey barrels from suppliers in the Middle East, eroding profit margins even more, say traders and analysts.India has to import 88% of its crude needs and the nation took advantage of cheaper Russian oil following the war in Ukraine as others shunned Moscow’s barrels. But the trade, which has helped put the state-owned refiners on track for a rebound in net income this year, is under pressure.107905419Gross refining margins for processors including Indian Oil Corp. dropped in the previous quarter due to higher freight rates, said Hardik Shah, director at credit ratings and analytics firm CareEdge Group. The company estimates lower margins for refiners so far this financial year, but they are still higher than pre-war levels.The state-run processors primarily sell fuel domestically and don’t get the benefit of higher prices overseas, unlike the export-focused private processors including Reliance Industries Ltd. — which also have more flexibility on buying and payments for Russian crude.Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment on margins.CareEdge predicts overall margins should hold around $10 a barrel, as long as crude prices stay below $90, a level that global benchmark Brent hasn’t been above since October. Futures traded near $83 on Thursday.107905816The attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels have also spilled into global fuel trade. Arrivals of fuel from India to Europe averaged just 18,000 barrels a day in the first two weeks of February, a plunge of more than 90% compared with January’s average, according to Vortexa Ltd.The disruptions will likely lead to some impact for Reliance and and Nayara Energy Ltd., although they still have export options across Asia and Africa. Cheaper Russian oil has allowed India’s refiners to be more competitive than their peers in South Korea, Singapore and across the world.If India loses the Russian advantage on crude, whatever marginal refining edge it had will be gone, according to Mukesh Sahdev, the head of oil trading and downstream research at Rystad Energy.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/energy/oil-gas/russias-disrupted-oil-trade-crimps-margins-for-indian-refiners/articleshow/107904419.cms

The plan will not require any amendment to the India's Atomic Energy Act of 1962 but will need a final go-ahead from the Department of Atomic Energy, said one of the two sources. Indian law bars private companies from setting up nuclear power plants but allows them to supply components, equipment and sign construction contracts for work outside of the reactors. New Delhi has not met its nuclear power capacity addition targets for years mainly because it could not procure nuclear fuel supplies. However in 2010, India struck a deal with the United States for supplies of reprocessed nuclear fuel. India's stringent nuclear compensation laws have hampered talks with foreign power plant builders such as General Electric and Westinghouse. The country has deferred a target to add 2,000 MW of nuclear power from 2020 to 2030.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/renewables/india-seeks-26-bln-of-private-nuclear-power-investments/articleshow/107848710.cms

RI,2024-02-20T08:01:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Russia’s crude oil delivery problems to India aren’t over yet,"Twelve tankers are anchored, holding the key Russian crude grade. Most havent moved far for more than a month, vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. The build-up started when ships carrying the crude to ports around the Indian coast came to a halt late last year and then turned back towards the South China Sea as December drew to a close.","Nearly 15 million barrels of Russia’s Sokol crude — meant for delivery to India — are sitting on tankers idling off the coasts of Malaysia and South Korea. They show little sign of moving.Twelve tankers are anchored, holding the key Russian crude grade. Most haven’t moved far for more than a month, vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.The build-up started when ships carrying the crude to ports around the Indian coast came to a halt late last year and then turned back towards the South China Sea as December drew to a close. Since then, the stranded shipments have been added to at a rate of about two new cargoes a week.It looked like the situation was starting to ease earlier this month, with three cargoes heading back to the south Asian nation. While a fourth is now signaling its destination as the Indian east coast port of Visakhapatnam, most remain stuck. And more continue to arrive, with an average of one 700,000 barrels cargo loaded onto specialized shuttle tankers at the De Kastri export terminal every three to four days.Those shuttle ships are piling up off the South Korean port of Yeosu, where they normally offload their cargoes onto other vessels for onward shipment to India. The hold-up could soon start to curb the pace of exports, if the shuttle tankers aren’t freed up soon to take on fresh cargoes.The fleet of seven ships, the most recent of which were delivered to Russia’s Sovcomflot PJSC from South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries shortly after Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine almost two years ago, were specifically designed for the job of hauling Sokol crude. Ice resistant, with a shallow draft and a bow-loading manifold that allows them to take on cargoes from the offshore terminal at De Kastri, they can’t be replaced with other ships.All seven of those ships are now holding cargoes. Four were anchored off Yeosu for at least a week, but three departed for Chinese ports over the weekend, as the need to free up the vessels becomes more acute.Three Sokol cargoes have already been delivered to ports in the north of China this month. That’s up from the normal level of one or two cargoes a month taken by the country’s refiners.Reopening IndiaIndian sources have given different reasons for the disruption to supplies.Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in January that refiners reduced oil imports from Russia as discounts on cargoes weren’t attractive, dismissing the notion flows dropped because of payment-related challenges.That view has been echoed by refiners themselves, with a person familiar with the operations of one processor saying that it has no plans to purchase Sokol as there is a premium of $2-$3 barrel compared with Urals, which means it doesn’t make any commercial sense to buy.However, Puri subsequently said that enforcement of a price cap imposed on Russian oil exports by the Group of Seven nations, along with challenges with shipping, had hampered some deliveries of Sokol to India.With Sokol trading above $70 a barrel, shipments of the grade are being keenly tracked by the US Treasury, which has begun taking a tougher line on sales of Russian crude that breach the cap.Several, but not all, of the Sokol cargoes that turned away from India were carried on vessels that had either been named explicitly on US sanctions list, or were managed by SUN Ship Management D Ltd., a company owned by Sovcomflot that’s been sanctionedIn the case of other cargoes, banks declined payment due to lack of clarity on ownership and the price exceeding the cap, according to market analytics firm Kpler and several Indian oil refinery officials.Recent deliveries of Sokol crude to India suggest that some of those difficulties have been overcome, at least for a handful of refiners.After Washington tightened sanctions, India’s banks have become much more cautious. They are demanding attestation from Indian refiners that the crude was purchased below the price cap and not carried on a sanctioned ship, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.Nayara Energy Ltd, part-owned by Russia’s Rosneft PJSC, received a cargo at its Vadinar import terminal on Feb. 6. Another was delivered on Feb. 15 to Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd’s refinery at Mumbai. The HCPL cargo was purchased through a trading company, rather than direct from the producer, according to a source familiar with the deal.A third tanker full of Sokol is now anchored off the port of Visakhapatnam, where HCPL also has a refinery and a fourth is heading to Sikka, the discharge location for Reliance Industries Ltd’s refinery. Sikka is adjacent to Vadinar and it’s not uncommon for ships to change their signals as they get closer.India is Sokol’s largest buyer and the grade accounts for about 10% of its total imports from Russia. Unless Sokol imports are normalized, India’s shipments from Russia are unlikely to hit the 2.1 million barrels a day reached last spring.There is still no clarity whether transferring cargoes onto unsanctioned tankers will unlock the Sokol trade to India. But one thing is clear, Indian refiners are in not rushing back yet.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/energy/oil-gas/russias-crude-oil-delivery-problems-to-india-arent-over-yet/articleshow/107835883.cms
RI,2024-02-20T07:25:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Bank of America expects India fundraising to be busier than ever,"“2023 was the year of block trades, 2024 is going to be the year of IPOs — and that momentum will most likely carry into 2025,” Debasish Purohit said in an interview with Bloomberg News in Mumbai. “2024 and 2025 as a block will be the busiest years of IPOs in our lifetime.”","Fundraising activity in India will be stronger than ever over the next two years as conglomerates, tech firms and financial services providers hunt for capital to fuel growth and owners seize the moment to sell holdings, Bank of America Corp.’s co-head of investment banking in the country said. “2023 was the year of block trades, 2024 is going to be the year of IPOs — and that momentum will most likely carry into 2025,” Debasish Purohit said in an interview with Bloomberg News in Mumbai. “2024 and 2025 as a block will be the busiest years of IPOs in our lifetime.” Purohit expects between 5 and 10 tech firms and two or three local subsidiaries of multinational companies to launch initial public offerings in the period. Reliance Industries Ltd., controlled by Asia’s richest person Mukesh Ambani, has been looking to list its wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and Reliance Retail Ventures for several years, while the financial services unit of Tata Sons, another giant conglomerate, is one of several shadow lenders that the Reserve Bank of India has told to list before 2025. Hyundai Motor Co. is also considering listing its Indian business in one of the country’s biggest IPOs, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. India’s equity markets have been on a tear — the benchmark Sensex has risen in all of the past eight years, including a 19% rally in 2023 — and the retail investor base in the world’s most populous country is growing. A robust economy also provides favorable conditions for IPOs and exit opportunities for investors. The International Monetary Fund expects India’s economy to grow 6.5% in 2024 and 2025 following its 6.7% expansion last year. This is unfolding as neighbor China tries to address ructions in its stock and property markets, along with trade conflicts and various regulatory crackdowns. That’s further encouraging global investors to shift billions of dollars into India.“Every single private equity fund that you talk to wants to have a China plus strategy, so you’ll see at least two, three funds being raised for India alone,” said Purohit, who has worked in investment banking for over two decades. India should be regarded as a standalone market rather than an extension or part of the wider Asia Pacific, according to Purohit. Japan and South Korea are sources for inbound deals in real estate, infrastructure, manufacturing and financial services, while investment in local semiconductor businesses may come from Taiwan, he said. Some founders of Indian companies will partner with financial sponsors to spur growth, while others will exit or sell assets amid sector consolidation or based on family decisions, according to Purohit.“These are three or four broad areas which will attract M&A,” he said. “If you get 7% to 8% of the fee pool you are in a good place.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/bank-of-america-expects-india-fundraising-to-be-busier-than-ever/articleshow/107835526.cms

Needless to say, we need sustainability above 22,150 to end the consolidation and march towards the 22,500+ zone else profit-taking may resume. Traders should keep a close watch on the banking index for cues while others may continue to play a supportive role on a rotational basis. Besides, the performance of the global indices, especially the US, will remain on their radar,  said Ajit Mishra, Religare Broking.Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said,  Though, Nifty placed near the crucial overhead resistance of 22,125 levels, still there is no indication of any significant reversal pattern building at the highs. There is a possibility of some more upside towards the new all-time high of around 22,150 levels before showing any selling pressure from the new highs. Immediate support is at 21,920 levels. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday's action:US marketStocks slipped Friday to send Wall Street to a rare losing week, just its second in the last 16.The S&P 500 fell 0.5% from its all-time high set a day earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 145 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.8%.European sharesEuropean shares ended a data-packed week on an upbeat note with stellar earnings updates and hopes of imminent rate cuts by the European Central Bank lifting investors' appetite for risky assets.The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.6% to hit a fresh two-year high, led by miners, which jumped 2.5% this week and touched a two-week high.Tech View: Spinning top candleNifty on Friday ended 139 points higher above the 22,000 mark to form a spinning top candle on the daily charts and indicate indecisiveness. The index looks set to test record high levels next week.The short-term moving averages are below the price action and should continue to support the indices on every decline. 22,000 is an immediate support to watch, while the bigger area of support stands at 21,800-850.

It is bigger than American giants like McDonald's, PepsiCo, Netflix, and Accenture. RIL is also the only Indian company among the world's 50 most valuable companies and is also one of the top candidates to become India's first $1 trillion stock.","With its market capitalisation growing at an average annual run rate of Rs 1 lakh crore in the last two decades, billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries is undoubtedly the largest wealth creator in the history of Dalal Street. After India's most valued stock touched the Rs 20 lakh crore milestone this week, it is now bigger than the likes of American MNC giants like McDonald's, PepsiCo, Netflix and Accenture.Shareholders of RIL, which was worth just Rs 1 lakh crore in August 2005, have made a notional profit of Rs 19 lakh crore in a span of less than 19 years.RIL hit the Rs 5 lakh crore m-cap feat in July 2017, Rs 10 lakh crore in November 2019, and Rs 15 lakh crore in September 2021 while the Rs 20 lakh crore landmark was achieved on 13 February 2024.     107712465With analysts expecting 2024 to be an eventful year for RIL as the past two years of investments move into the monetization phase, stock prices have jumped 28% in the last 3 months alone.The peerless conglomerate can't be compared to other listed or unlisted companies in India because it houses well-diversified businesses of petrochemicals, new energy, telecom and retail. In absolute terms, the stock is nearly double of HDFC Bank and roughly 3 times the size of ICICI Bank and Infosys.Mukesh Ambani fuelling India’s $1 trillion dreamIn US dollar terms, RIL is worth around $241 billion and is the only Indian company to feature in the list of world's 50 most valuable companies. At No. 42, it is bigger than American giants like PepsiCo, McDonald's, Shell, Cisco, Walt Disney, Netflix and Accenture, shows data from Companies Market Cap (as on 14 Feb 2023).Tata Consultancy Services or TCS, which is India's second largest company, is worth about Rs 15 lakh crore and at No.66 on the list of world's biggest companies. HDFC Bank (Rs 10.6 lakh crore) is the third and last Indian stock which finds a place in the world's top 100 list.Also read | Mukesh Ambani, Sunil Mittal may deal with an unfinished agenda after Lok Sabha electionsWhile RIL looks like a colossus on Dalal Street, it is worth just 8% of the largest stock on Wall Street. Globally, there are seven $1 trillion stocks, with Saudi Aramco (listed in Saudi Arabia) being the only non-American stock in the elite club.Valued at $3 trillion, Microsoft is the most valued company on earth after snatching the crown from Apple ($2.8 trillion) recently.Others in the $1 trillion club are Alphabet (Google), Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms (Facebook).The hunt for India's first $1 trillion stock shows that there are three candidates - HDFC Bank, RIL and Bajaj Finance. Calculations done by ICICI Securities shows that RIL could make it by 2032 if its profit growth trajectory jumps up to about 21% against 10-year PAT CAGR of 13%, assuming no PE re-rating. The macro framework is based on the assumption of reaching peak corporate profitability (~7% ‘PAT/GDP’ ratio) in the listed space driven by gradual advancement towards peak GDP growth of ~9%. Other key assumptions include – ratio of the largest stock’s m-cap to aggregate m-cap sustaining at long-term average of 5-6% and no re-rating in P/E ratios from current levels,  said Vinod Karki of ICICI Securities.Based on the historical average number of companies with market value greater than a-tenth of the top company’s m-cap, it is likely that around 30-40 stocks with $100 billion size may exist in 2032, he said.What's next for RIL?RIL's Q3 results showed that its capex at $3.6 billion fell 22% quarter-on-quarter to 2-year-low as Jio's capex declined on completion of 5G pan India rollout. Retail capex was also low on muted new store rollout. We think investment cycles will be shorter than in the past two decades, with limited impact on balance sheet leverage. The key to watch will be the startup of revenues from the new energy vertical, which we believe remains most underappreciated in NAV,  Morgan Stanley's Mayank Maheshwari.A turn in the chemical cycle, a golden age for refining, traction in 5G subscribers and a slowdown in investments in retail could be among key events that garner investor traction, he said.RIL will also benefit from its robust free cash flow generation of Rs 30,000 crore in FY25, declining capex levels to Rs 1.25 lakh crore and declining debt levels to Rs 2.72 lakh crore. Commencement of new energy operations will be a key event in coming quarters for RIL, analysts say.It is expected that Jio may opt for a tariff hike after the Lok Sabha elections while retail will see revenue per square foot improving as store additions slow and older stores mature.If RIL becomes India’s first $1 trillion stock, the personal wealth of the Ambani family will also zoom as they own more than half of the conglomerate.(Data: Ritesh Presswala)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The potential deal would strengthen Reliance's presence in India's television distribution sector and expand the reach of its streaming platform, JioCinema. Tata Play, owned by Tata Sons and Temasek, faces competition from Netflix, Hotstar, JioCinema, and Amazon Prime.","Reliance Industries is reportedly in discussions to acquire a 29.8% stake in Tata Play, a subscription-based satellite TV and video streaming service, from Walt Disney, Business Standard newspaper reported citing sources close to the development.The potential deal signifies Mukesh Ambani-owned Indian oil-to-telecom conglomerate's strategic move to strengthen its presence in India's television distribution sector and expand the reach of its OTT platform, JioCinema.Tata Play did not respond to ET Online's query on this development.Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata group, currently holds a majority 50.2% stake in Tata Play, with the rest of the shares owned by Temasek, a Singapore-based fund. ET had reported in October last year citing sources aware of the development that Singapore-based investment firm Temasek is in advanced talks with the Tata Group to sell its 20% stake in Tata Play to the Indian conglomerate that owns the largest stake in the direct-to-home (DTH) company.However, no agreement was reached.If the negotiations between Reliance and Tata Play prove successful, it would mark the first collaboration between the Tata group and the Ambanis. Additionally, it would expand the reach of JioCinema, Reliance's streaming platform, to Tata Play customers. Disney had initially planned to divest its shares during Tata Play's IPO, but with the postponement of the listing, it began exploring other exit strategies.Sources familiar with the matter said that Reliance aims to offer its entire JioCinema content catalog to Tata Play customers upon acquiring the stake. I think if this is true, it does make sense for Reliance because they are already present on the MSO (multiple-system operator) side through Hathway and DEN, but DTH side they don't have presence,  Karan Taurani, analyst at Elara Capital, told ET Online.  In the current market environment, MSO side is losing market share to DTH, which has got a more premium customer base compared to MSO in terms of ARPUs. So, DTH has a protected base with the premium customer base and that will augur well for JioCinema to tie up and reach out to a larger subscriber base,  he said, adding it will also limit the competitive intensity for Reliance that has bundled offerings.Bankers are currently assessing the value of Disney's stake in Tata Play, Business Standard reported citing sources. Despite its significant presence in the market, satellite television broadcaster Tata Play faces challenges from competing streaming platforms like Netflix, Hotstar, JioCinema, and Amazon Prime. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, Tata Play reported a loss of Rs 105 crore on revenue of Rs 4,499 crore, contrasting with the previous year's profit of Rs 68.60 crore on revenue of Rs 4,741 crore.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/media/reliance-in-talks-to-buy-30-tata-play-stake-from-disney-to-strengthen-television-distribution-jiocinema/articleshow/107707411.cms

The company added that it has accrued Rs 72.1 crore for bank guarantee commission and interest expenses for its share of bank guarantee and deposit as per the agreement.,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises has accused Walt Disney-owned Star India of violating the ICC TV rights agreement and has sought a refund of Rs 69 crore paid as part of the agreement.Zee asserted in its Q3 financial statements that it has strong grounds to counter Star India's claims in the ICC TV rights agreement matter. The company added that it has accrued Rs 72.1 crore for bank guarantee commission and interest expenses for its share of bank guarantee and deposit as per the agreement.Star India has sent letters to Zee through its legal counsel accusing the company of breaching the ICC TV rights agreement due to the non-payment of $203.5 million in the first installment of the rights fee along with the payment of the bank guarantee commission deposit of Rs 17 crore.Zee, on the other hand, has accused Star of failing to comply with the agreement due to its inability to obtain necessary approvals and execute necessary documents and agreements. The company claimed that the agreement was contingent on financial commitments, bank and corporate guarantees, and final ICC approval for the sub-licencing deal. The management believes that Star, by its conduct, has breached the Alliance Agreement and is in default of the terms thereof, and consequently, the contract stands repudiated,  Zee said in its note to the financial statements. The company said it has communicated to Star that the alliance agreement cannot be proceeded with for the reasons set out above and has also sought a refund of Rs 68.54 crore paid to Star,  it added.Zee said it doesn't anticipate any significant adverse impact from the contract repudiation, and there is no need to make any adjustments to the accompanying statement.On August 26, 2022, Zee signed an agreement to set out the basis on which Star India would sub-licence the ICC TV rights to the company for men's and u-19 events for four years until 2027.It is pertinent to note that the Walt Disney-owned company, which is in merger talks with Reliance Industries' Viacom18, had acquired the ICC media rights for $3 billion.As part of its pre-bid understanding with Zee, Disney Star had sub-licenced the ICC TV rights to the company for $1.5 billion. The company retained the ICC digital rights after acquiring the Indian Premier League (IPL) TV rights in the same year.Zee, which at that time was in the process of merging with Sony Group's India unit Culver Max Entertainment, had acquired the ICC TV rights since sports would have been a key focus area for the proposed Sony-Zee merged entity.Sony was expected to infuse growth capital of $1.5 billion into the merged entity, which would have been deployed for content investments in sports and digital.The merger, which had been in the works for two years, was called off by Sony last month due to Zee's apparent failure to meet the closing conditions.Zee's inability to stick to the ICC TV deal has meant that Star will have to service the entire $3 billion contract, which has put a strain on its valuation and is expected to dent its future profits.ET had reported that Reliance has reduced Star India's valuation by up to $2 billion due to anticipated losses from the ICC contract over the next four years.Star and Viacom18 are nearing the completion of a merger deal that values both entities at $4 billion each. Disney purchased Star for upwards of $15 billion as part of its $71 billion acquisition of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox in 2019.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/zee-entertainment-seeks-rs-69-crore-refund-from-star-after-failed-icc-tv-deal/articleshow/107670174.cms

Here’s what analyst Kush Ghodasara, CMT (SEBI RA : INH000002137), had to say:Reliance IndustriesReliance Industries stock has been a marked outperformer in the recent past but we notice a Rising Wedge pattern forming near the life highs.Generally, such patterns are scary and are considered as a sign of reversal on breakout but could also fail, too. The stock price is also showing a slight negative divergence where the price has been rising but the RSI (momentum) is declining.Secondly, even the volumes are on a decreasing trend in the last few sessions. Therefore, we recommend that investors/traders should avoid fresh longs but keep trailing stop loss at Rs 2,880, which is a 10-day average support and pattern breakdown. 107664824HDFC AMCThe stock has been on a dream run since the low formed in November 2023 and it is travelling in an uptrending channel. It has managed to cross over the trend line but it is not sustaining for more than 2 sessions, which is generally a technical confirmation.Indicators suggest some more short-term buzz as internal crossovers are positive. The stock can be bought with a strict stop loss at Rs 3,596, which is the 10-day average. 107664838OFSSThe stock has given a rare bullish pattern breakout which is a Flag pattern. The rally between the two blue lines is termed a Pole while consolidation between green lines (horizontal) can be termed as Flag.The breakout above the Flag can give a rally equidistance to the pole which means almost 1900 above breakout in this case. Therefore, for medium term, the stock can be bought for a target of Rs 9,000 with a stop loss placed at Rs 7,040 on a closing basis. 107664848(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

RI,2024-02-13T11:28:00+05:30,Nikhil Agarwal,Reliance Industries becomes first Indian stock to cross Rs 20 lakh crore market cap,"Reliance Industries (RIL) becomes the first listed Indian entity to cross Rs 20 lakh crore market cap milestone. Analysts from Morgan Stanley, Jefferies, Sharekhan, and Citi have provided target prices and assessments of RIL's future prospects. RIL's market value has increased by Rs 1 lakh crore in the last two weeks alone.","Shares of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) today become the first listed Indian entity to cross the Rs 20 lakh crore market capitalisation milestone after the stock rallied up to 1.89% to hit fresh 52-week high of Rs 2957.80 on BSE.In the last two weeks alone, the stock's market value has gone up by Rs 1 lakh crore as the Rs 19 lakh crore-level was touched on January 29. So far in the calendar year, the share price of India's most valued stock has gone up by about 14%.The Mumbai-based oil-to-telecom conglomerate has been one of the biggest wealth creators in Dalal Street's history. RIL shares had hit the Rs 1 lakh crore market cap mark in August 2005, while the Rs 10 lakh crore level was achieved in November 2019.At Rs 20 lakh crore, RIL remains India's most valued firm and way ahead of TCS (Rs 15 lakh crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 10.5 lakh crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 7 lakh crore) and Infosys (Rs 7 lakh crore).Also Read | LIC ditched 19 smallcaps in Q3. Is it end of party or jittery exit?RIL's December quarter results were largely in-line with market expectations with its O2C EBITDA dropping 14% QoQ to Rs 140.6 billion due to maintenance in multiple units combined with lower cracks & deltas. Jio’s EBITDA was up 1.4% QoQ to Rs 142.6 billion, while Retail EBITDA rose 8% QoQ to Rs 62.7 billion.RIL's profit after tax stood at Rs 19,641 crore in Q3FY24, down 1.2% QoQ and up 10.3% YoY and above market expectations of Rs 18,080 crore. PAT margin came at 8.7% versus 8.6% in the previous quarter. We see this earnings report as a positive turning point to RIL's investment cycle and expectations on energy profitability. RIL's F3Q24 EBITDA (Rs405bn, down 0.7% QoQ) was a slight beat, 2% above our estimates, as better-than-expected gas production EBITDA more than negated the impact of fuel refinery maintenance,  Morgan Stanley said while giving a target price of Rs 2,821.Analysts expect 2024 to be an eventful year for RIL as the past two years of investments move into the monetization phase.  We think investment cycles will be shorter than in the past two decades, with limited impact on balance sheet leverage,  the brokerage said, adding that a turn in the chemical cycle, a golden age for refining, traction in 5G subscribers and a slowdown in investments in retail could be among key events that garner investor traction.Jefferies, which has forecast 12% Ebitda growth in FY25 with Jio contributing lion's share on the back of a tariff hike, has a target price on Rs 3,140.Sharekhan has maintained Buy rating on RIL saying that it is a compelling long term investment bet given strong prospects across business and potential value unlocking from retail, digital services, and financial services portfolio.Citi, on the other hand, has downgraded RIL to neutral as the risk-to-reward ratio is fairly balanced. We raise our FY24-26E EBITDA by 2-5% led by Jio (higher tariff hikes), retail (recent robust performance), and O2C (3Q beat). The stock’s recent outperformance, however, makes risk/reward more balanced, in our view, and we downgrade to Neutral with a Rs 2910 target price,  Citi said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Many such stocks driven up by speculative buying without consideration for the fundamentals are correcting. This trend is likely to continue since many such stocks are excessively valued,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. The explosive growth in the number of demat accounts and the newbies chasing mid and small caps influenced by recency bias have contributed to this froth in the broader market. A correction in this segment is inevitable and desirable. Correction will give opportunities to buy fairly valued stocks in this segment like PSU Banks,  Vijayakumar added.Deven Mehata, Research Analyst at Choice Broking, said,  Nifty can find support at 21,550 followed by 21,500 and 21,400.

RI,2024-02-12T22:24:00+05:30,Arindam Majumder,Government asks Mumbai Airport to reduce flights to ease congestion,"The government has directed Mumbai airport to reduce scheduled flights and limit business jet movements during peak hours to alleviate congestion. This mandate will result in the cancellation of approximately 40 flights, impacting airlines like IndiGo and Air India. Additionally, the extension of the curfew on business jets has drawn criticism from corporate giants.","The government has asked Mumbai airport to reduce the number of scheduled flights and restrict the movement of business jets during rush hours in a bid to reduce congestion and improve on-time departures. The move will force airlines to cut some 40 flights and hit operations of private jets which is used by some of the country's top business houses. The Airport Authority of India, which handles air navigation services, has asked the airport to reduce aircraft movement from 46 to 44 during rush hour and from 44 to 42 during non-peak hours.The direction to reduce the number of flights will force airlines to cut around 40 flights from the middle of this week, industry executives familiar with the matter said. IndiGo, which operates the highest number of flights, will have to reduce 18 flights while the Air India group including Vistara will have to cut 17, executives said.Simultaneously, the curfew on operation of business jets has been extended from four hours to eight hours, leading to protests from top corporate groups such as Reliance Industries, JSW and the Mahindra group.Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), which operates the airport, didn’t comment till press time.The airport, owned by the Adani group, is the second busiest in the country after Delhi and sees heavy movement of business jets. It operates more flights than any airport with a single runway and in December, handled its highest-monthly traffic of 4.88 million passengers.People aware of the development said that the decision was taken after civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia raised concerns over the plummeting on-time departure numbers at the airport.107639301Senior air traffic controllers termed the leading cause of delay to overscheduling by airlines amid increasing demand for air travel this year.“Runway capacity is the sum of multiple things like availability of infrastructure such as parking stands and the time taken by the aircraft to vacate the runway. The airport had given slots to airlines considering the peak handling capacity. But for instance, if an aircraft is pushing back from one bay, the aircraft in the adjacent parking bay cannot move despite being ready to take off,” a government official said. “Also, in a city like Mumbai, there are multiple unscheduled movements like aircraft of government and business houses which sometimes delays scheduled flights.”He added that the government has also asked airports that from the upcoming summer schedule, they should factor in unforeseen circumstances while forecasting peak hour capacity.Airline network planners said that such sudden cancellations hurt their ability to redeploy the aircraft, leading to losses. “Airlines will have to shell out a substantial amount to passengers as compensation,” said an airline executive.Rajesh Bali, managing director of Business Aircraft Operator Association, said that the extra restriction on business jets is concerning as corporate leaders who rely on private jets for their travel needs already had limited slots to operate. “The new restrictions will significantly hamper business aviation operations, affecting the functionality of Mumbai as the commercial hub of the nation,” he said.Air traffic has increased exponentially after COVID with passenger traffic surpassing pre-pandemic records. But every major airport has seen severe congestion, leading to public outcry.Aviation security regulator BCAS has mandated that any addition of new flights at airports has to be based on passenger-handling capacity at security checkpoints. BCAS has set a standard saying that each X-ray machine can handle a maximum of 180 passengers per hour on the domestic side and 160 passengers on the international side.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-asks-mumbai-airport-to-reduce-flights-to-ease-congestion/articleshow/107637339.cms

The daily momentum indicator has triggered a negative crossover, which is a sell signal. Thus, both price and momentum indicators suggest weakness. The broader market witnessed a deep cut even on Monday. The Midcap index was down 2.57% and the Smallcap index cracked 4% on Monday. The crucial support zone for Midcap index is placed at 46960 – 46550 and that for the Small cap Index is placed at 15440 – 15400,  Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan, said.Shrey Jain, Founder and CEO of SAS Online, said,  From a technical standpoint, the Nifty is encountering selling pressure, a trend anticipated to persist in the coming sessions. Monitoring the support zone between 21,500-21,450 is crucial to sustaining positive momentum. Additionally, the Nifty faces resistance at 21,850, potentially signalling a breakout point.

The operating loss stood at $129 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year, which included the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022, a smaller event compared with the 50-over World Cup, ET reported February 9. Walt Disney follows an October-September annual financial calendar.However, Disney+Hotstar, the video-streaming service owned by the Burbank, California-based company, saw its first-ever increase in paid subscribers since the loss of the digital rights to the Indian Premier League (IPL) last year. In the first quarter, paid users went up by 2% to 38.3 million, from 37.6 million at the end of the September quarter, but core Disney+ subscribers dropped by 1% to 46.1 million. The Disney+Hotstar service has seen a steady decline in its subscriber base in recent months, ever since it lost the IPL digital rights last year to Viacom18.Disney chief executive Bob Iger has said the latest results proved that the media giant had “turned the corner and entered into a new era.”Iger has been facing proxy battles with Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners and Blackwells Capital, which are seeking board seats and other changes aimed at boosting share price. The stock rose 11.5% on February 8, its biggest one-day gain since November 2020, to a one-year high of $110.54, taking its advance in 2024 to about 22%. It was after better-than-expected quarterly numbers and the unveiling of several shareholder-soothing initiatives, including a $3-billion share buyback and a 50% dividend increase.Iger also announced a $1.5-billion investment in Epic Games, the group behind the popular game Fortnite. Both companies will join forces to build a Disney Universe over the next few years, a move Iger said marks the company’s biggest shift into gaming, a fast-growing space where tech giants like Microsoft are making mega strides via big-bang buyouts.One way to manage Disney’s cost base without standalone cuts could be to extract synergies out of transactions with other companies, according to US media sector analysts at Barclays.Walt Disney-owned Star India’s consolidated net profit for FY23 dropped 31% to Rs 1,272 crore from the previous fiscal year, according to its filing with the Registrar of Companies.

Walt Disney follows an October-September annual financial calendar.However, Disney+Hotstar, the video-streaming service owned by the Burbank, California-based company, saw its first-ever increase in paid subscribers since the loss of the digital rights to the Indian Premier League (IPL) last year. In the first quarter, paid users went up by 2% to 38.3 million, from 37.6 million at the end of the September quarter, but core Disney+ subscribers dropped by 1% to 46.1 million. The Disney+Hotstar service has seen a steady decline in its subscriber base in recent months, ever since it lost the IPL digital rights last year to Viacom18.Disney chief executive Bob Iger has said the latest results proved that the media giant had “turned the corner and entered into a new era.”Iger has been facing proxy battles with Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners and Blackwells Capital, which are seeking board seats and other changes aimed at boosting share price. The stock rose 11.5% on February 8, its biggest one-day gain since November 2020, to a one-year high of $110.54, taking its advance in 2024 to about 22%. It was after better-than-expected quarterly numbers and the unveiling of several shareholder-soothing initiatives, including a $3-billion share buyback and a 50% dividend increase.Iger also announced a $1.5-billion investment in Epic Games, the group behind the popular game Fortnite. Both companies will join forces to build a Disney Universe over the next few years, a move Iger said marks the company’s biggest shift into gaming, a fast-growing space where tech giants like Microsoft are making mega strides via big-bang buyouts.One way to manage Disney’s cost base without standalone cuts could be to extract synergies out of transactions with other companies, according to US media sector analysts at Barclays.Walt Disney-owned Star India’s consolidated net profit for FY23 dropped 31% to Rs 1,272 crore from the previous fiscal year, according to its filing with the Registrar of Companies. Novi Digital Entertainment, the subsidiary that owns Disney+Hotstar, has seen its net loss more than double to Rs 748 crore, while revenue rose 35% to Rs 4,341 crore. Novi is in the process of merging with its parent company, Star, which holds a 78.07% stake in it.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/disney-reliance-merger-discussions-reach-last-lap-as-feb-17-exclusivity-deadline-draws-near/articleshow/107610558.cms

The slightly negative news, from the market perspective, came yesterday in the slightly hawkish comments of the RBI Governor. The good news that the economy is doing better-than-expected and a GDP growth projection of 7% and CPI inflation of 4.5% for FY 25 was ignored,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. FII selling and bear onslaught are unlikely to take the market down significantly. There will be strong buying on dips. The sustained flows into mutual funds which are gathering momentum will enable the DIIs to buy aggressively.

The other two applicants in the fray- Reliance Industries and a Power Finance Corporation (PFC)-led consortium- did not participate in the auction.That resulted in the Adani Group company being declared the winning bidder for the active power producer, said the people cited above.Lenders had pegged Adani Power's latest offer of ₹4,101 crore as the base price for the auction of the thermal power company. They also stipulated that the counteroffers should be at least ₹50 crore higher than the base bid for the auction to proceed.Adani Power and the KPMG-backed resolution professional, Saurabh Kumar Tikmani, did not respond to ET's request for comments.Lanco Amarkantak Power was admitted for corporate insolvency proceedings in September 2019, but its resolution got delayed for various reasons. In January 2022, lenders rejected the sole offer of ₹3,000 crore from Twin Star Technologies, a company owned by metals maven Anil Agarwal, on the ground that it was too low.Later, when lenders restarted the sale process, Adani, Reliance Industries and the PFC-led consortium showed interest in acquiring the company. Adani and Reliance did not participate in the auction, citing a violation of the sale process, while the PFC-led consortium was sole bidder offering ₹3,020 crore. In January 2023, 95% of lenders by value voted in favour of the PFC-led consortium's plan but the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) did not endorse the plan for several months.Thereafter, Adani Power gave an unsolicited improved offer of ₹3,650 crore, as reported by ET on November 2, and later, it improved the offer to ₹4,101 crore, as reported by ET on December 13.Just when lenders were considering Adani's offer, Jindal Power filed a petition with the tribunal seeking approval to participate in the proposed auction of Lanco Amarkantak. It gave a Rs 4,203 crore cash offer along with a Rs 100-crore bank guarantee, as reported by ET on January 13 and January 17, respectively. Jindal Power's Rs 4,203 crore offer is a tad higher than Rs 4,101 crore offered by Adani Power a month ago.However, within 10 days, Jindal Power did a U-turn and withdrew from the race for Lanco Amarkantak, as reported by ET on January 25. Lanco Amarkantak's first phase, which is fully operational, has two units of 300 MW each. The second phase, under construction, comprises two units of 600 MW each. It has Rs 1,800 crore cash in the company solely on account of operations from the first phase.

Whereas, Nifty Bank, Financial Services, Metal, and Realty opened lower.Experts View The near-term market trend indicates exhaustion and there are no clear positive triggers that can take the market to sustained new highs immediately. An important event coming up is the RBI meeting on 8th. But no positive triggers like a rate cut are likely from the RBI meeting,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. The positive takeaway is that the U.S. economy is doing surprisingly well and a sharp global slowdown triggered by a possible US recession is very unlikely. This, along with declining inflation in the US can support global equity markets,  Vijayakumar added.Mandar Bhojane, Choice Broking, said,  The Nifty index has formed a double top pattern on the daily chart, signaling a potential cautious stance for traders. The resistance level is identified at 22,200, and a decisive break above this on a closing basis could invalidate the bearish outlook. Conversely, the support for the index is situated at 21,600, coinciding with its 20-day moving average (20 DMA). A breach below this support level might intensify selling pressure in the market.
