RI,2024-01-30T12:09:32+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra,"Does RIL set the stage for largecaps comeback? Not really, say analysts","On January 29, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) single-handedly contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation.  ","A 6 percent rally in Reliance Industries on January 29 does not really indicate a comeback for largecap stocks, analysts told Moneycontrol. Money is simply flowing from one largecap to another as foreign investors are recasting their portfolios, they argued.  On January 29, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) alone contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation, while ONGC, Adani Enterprises, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, HDFC Bank and Coal India together contributed over 26 percent to the rally.  &quot;Reliance benefits from three things: Zee-Sony merger fallout, refining margins shaping well, and new energy vertical scaling up. It is a very stock-specific move,&quot; said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Direct.  Also Read: RIL rally triggered by funds taking refuge in ‘strong stock’ to hedge against short positions  &quot;I don't think the Reliance move indicates a trend reversal for largecaps, though largecaps are a lot more attractive than midcaps from a risk-reward perspective. Till the results season pans out, it will be a lot of stock-specific moves, I believe,&quot; Pandey said.  RIL strong, other heavyweights weak  The sheer weight of Reliance Industries on the Nifty 50, which was 9.2 percent as of end-December, means that any further rally in the stock should propel the benchmark index further, in theory. But, other heavyweights like HDFC Bank and TCS are not showing enough strength for the index to move forward decisively, said analysts.  HDFC Bank is down 14 percent in the past one month while TCS is up barely 0.16 percent. As of December-end, HDFC Bank had 13.52 percent weightage on the index, TCS had 4.5 percent.  HDFC Bank shares have seen a sharp sell-off after its Q3 FY24 results. The bank reported a key miss in net interest margins (NIM) due to the low deposit growth and higher cost of funds. Higher provisions and decadal low earnings per share (EPS) growth in Q3 are also contributing to the decline in shares.  All IT companies, including TCS and Infosys, continued to post soft numbers in Q3.  Also Read: HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie  On the other hand, the recent surge in Singapore GRMs (gross refining margins) indicates a positive outlook for RIL's oil-to-chemicals business, said independent analyst Prakash Diwan.  This marks a valuation reset for RIL, which is currently under-owned by FIIs, he said. &quot;As FIIs sell HDFC Bank, IT and FMCG stocks due to bleak outlook, they will redirect funds elsewhere. And, RIL will be a big beneficiary. FIIs can move out of some stocks but cannot move out of Indian markets as a whole, so money is now going to RIL,&quot; Diwan added.  Where is Nifty headed next?  With the Interim Budget just a couple of months away, the Q3 results season still playing out, and valuations slightly out of the comfort zone, the Nifty 50 is expected to remain rangebound.  Going ahead, similar erratic movements may persist ahead of key events, said analysts at Angel One. Immediate resistance for the Nifty is apparent around the 21,850 - 21,950 zone, while immediate support has shifted higher towards the 21,600-21,550 zone.

RI,2024-01-30T05:59:17+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Trade Spotlight | How to trade in Reliance, Power Finance, MCX India counters today","Reliance Industries has seen a decisive breakout of downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of January 16 and January 20, and clocked 7 percent rally to end at record closing high of Rs 2,896.","With the solid start to the February series, the Nifty 50 has cleared its both hurdles (21,500 and 21,700) in a single day, after forming a temporary bottom at the 21,137 level. Hence, if the index manages to hold the momentum, 21,850-22,000 is the area to watch out for on the higher side, which can give the confirmation to the start of a higher-high-higher-low formation, whereas on the other side, 21,600-21,500 is expected to be the near-term support area for the index, experts said.  On January 29, the BSE Sensex rallied 1,241 points or 1.8 percent to 71,942, while the Nifty 50 surged 385 points or 1.8 percent to 21,738 and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1.6 percent and 1.5 percent.

The stock jumped 6 percent to Rs 3,415 and traded well above all key moving averages.  Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Reliance Industries  It is rare to see this stock rally by more than 7 percent in single day. Reliance Industries surpassed its previous record highs of Rs 2,792 level and achieved fresh record highs of Rs 2,905 level which keeps the tone positive for the stock.  Parabolic Sar dots has started to form below the price which is also suggesting that short term bias is bullish. Stochastic RSI (relative strength index) is also confirming the bullish bias as it has given bullish crossover. Stock has shown sharp upside move, buy on dips seems to be a prudent strategy.  In short, Reliance is bullish. Buy on dips can be used to ride the trend as far as price hold Rs 2,790 on the downside for further upside levels of Rs 3,000.    PFC  On the below chart, we can see that stock has given breakout of the rectangular pattern, indicating up move post accumulation. In the previous session, price has closed above Rs 432 with increase in volume. This confirms breakout of the trading range.  Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has also shown a bullish crossover which is acting as a double confirmation.  In short, trend for PFC looks positive. Use dips towards Rs 432 as a buying opportunity with the target of Rs 465 as long as Rs 410 holds on the downside.    MCX India  MCX price gave breakout from consolidation technical pattern which keeps the tone positive. Bollinger Bands expansion suggest that momentum is likely to continue on upside in next few trading sessions.

Experts feel 21,000 is expected to be the key to watch out for in the current week, which is full of events such as interim budget, and FOMC meet outcome, while on the higher side, 21,500 is likely to be the key hurdle, followed by resistance at the 21,700 levels.  The Nifty 50 during the last week settled at 21,353 level, while the Nifty Midcap 100 index was down 1.8 percent and Smallcap 100 index dropped 0.71 percent during the week.  &quot;When examined on a broader scale, a head and shoulders pattern confirms a bearish trend. This does not bode well for the bulls, suggesting potential challenges in the short term,&quot; Sameet Chavan, head of research for technical derivatives at Angel One, said.  He feels the Budget week is known for volatility, and &quot;considering the above formation we lean towards the bearish side&quot;.  In this scenario, the levels to monitor are around the psychological mark of 21,000, coinciding with 50SMA, and in the case of any negative surprises, the Nifty may decline towards 20,800 or even towards the bullish gap of 20,500, while on the flip side, resistance is anticipated, with 21,500 and the last week's high of 21,750 seen as formidable obstacles before Nifty targets the recent landmark high of around 22,100, he said.  Considering the overall chart structure, Vidnyan Sawant, HOD - Research at GEPL Capital also feels there is an anticipation of short-term volatility, with support near the 21,050 – 21,000 zone.

RI,2024-01-19T21:14:56+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"RIL Q3 surge driven by retail, Jio, oil &amp; gas earnings: Here are 10 key points","Reliance Q3 Results | Consolidated net profit grew by 10.9 percent on-year for the quarter despite higher finance, depreciation and finance costs.","Reliance Industries has recorded robust numbers for the quarter ended December, with profit and operating numbers beating analysts’ estimates, boosted by retail, digital (Jio) and oil &amp;amp; gas businesses.  The company’s stock has delivered a strong performance.  Since the low of October 2023, the company’s stock has surged 23 percent on the NSE, ending trading at Rs 2,734.9 on January 19.  Here are 10 key things from the earnings:  1) Net Profit  Reliance’s consolidated net profit grew by 10.9 percent on-year to Rs 19,641 crore for the December quarter of the current financial year 2023-24.  The major drivers for profitability were the consumer businesses and the oil &amp;amp; gas segment.  2) Revenue  Consolidated revenue for the third quarter came in at Rs 2.48 lakh crore, growing 3.2 percent from the year-ago period, supported by continued growth momentum in consumer businesses.  3) Operating Performance  Reliance’s quarterly EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased by 16.7 percent on-year to Rs 44,678 crore, led by growth across all businesses.  The double-digit growth in consolidated EBITDA was driven by 31.1 percent growth in Reliance Retail Ventures and 49.6 percent jump in oil &amp;amp; gas.  The oil-telecom-to-retail giant expanded its consolidated EBITDA margin to 18 percent for the quarter, up by 210 basis points over the corresponding period last fiscal.  4) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms registered a strong 11.6 percent on-year growth in net profit at Rs 5,445 crore for the quarter, while the revenue was at a record high of Rs 32,510 crore, growing 11.4 percent YoY, with ARPU (average revenue per user) increasing 2 percent YoY to Rs 181.7 with better subscriber mix partially offset by unlimited data allowance on 5G network.  The 5G rollout accelerated the subscriber addition momentum. Jio continued to outpace the competition, with 11.2 million net additions in Q3FY24, taking the subscriber base to 470.9 million, while the customer engagement on the Jio network remained strong, with total data and voice traffic increasing 31.5 percent to 38.1 billion GB, and 7.9 percent to 1.37 trillion minutes, respectively, from a year earlier.  The company has rolled out the Jio True 5G network across India ahead of schedule. About 90 million subscribers have been migrated to Jio’s 5G network. “The strong uptake of the JioBharat phone and JioAirFiber services has resulted in the continued expansion of Jio’s subscriber base, contributing to the stellar growth numbers of the digital services business,” Mukesh D Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, said. 5) Reliance Retail  Further, the retail segment has also delivered an impressive financial performance with its rapidly expanding physical as well as digital footprint.  Reliance Retail, too, posted a record quarterly revenue of Rs 83,063 crore, increasing 22.8 percent from the year-ago period, driven by grocery, fashion &amp;amp; lifestyle and consumer electronics businesses.  The segment’s net profit jumped 31.9 percent to Rs 3,165 crore for the quarter, while the EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points to 8.4 percent, led by operating leverage and continued focus on cost management.  Reliance Retail has expanded its store network, opening 252 new stores, taking the total count to 18,774 stores, while it recorded footfalls of over 282 million across formats, a growth of 40.3 percent from a year earlier.  6) Oil &amp;amp; Gas  The oil &amp;amp; gas business (exploration and production segment) also recorded healthy performance for the quarter with a massive 50.2 percent on-year growth in revenue at Rs 6,719 crore, mainly on account of higher volumes partly offset by lower price realisation from KG D6 Field.  Block KG D6 is currently producing around 30 MMSCMD gas and around 21,000 barrels of oil or condensate, the company said, adding the segment posted the highest-ever quarterly EBITDA at Rs 5,804 crore.  The average price realised for KG D6 gas was $9.66/MMBTU (metric million British thermal unit) in Q3FY24 against $11.32 in Q3FY23, while the average price realised for CBM gas was $15.55 per MMBTU against $20.92 during the same period. “KG D6 is now contributing 30 percent of India’s gas production, fueling its transition towards a greener and cleaner tomorrow,” Ambani said. 7) Oil to Chemicals (O2C)  The O2C segment delivered resilient performance aided by operational flexibility and strong domestic demand.  The oil-to-chemicals segment quarterly revenue fell 2.4 percent on-year to Rs 1.41 lakh crore primarily due to lower price realisation led by a 5.3 percent decline in average Brent crude oil prices from a year earlier.  The O2C EBITDA for the quarter marginally increased by 1 percent to Rs 14,064 crore led by higher gasoline cracks and advantageous feedstock sourcing. This was partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins and planned maintenance and inspection shutdown, Reliance said, adding the margin expanded by 40 basis points to 10 percent for the quarter.  The company's  planned maintenance and inspection shutdown of CDU, FCCU, delayed coking and ROGC complex impacted yields and profitability. O2C EBITDA would have been higher on YoY and comparable on QoQ basis if all major units had been available during the quarter.”  8) New Energy Business  The New Energy Giga Complex is all set to be commissioned in the second half of CY24. “I am confident that Reliance’s New Energy business will play a pivotal role in the global movement for adoption of cleaner fuels,” Ambani said. 9) Media Business  The media business delivered strong operating performance across verticals. TV News business revenue was up 23 percent from a year earlier, driven by the strong growth in advertising revenue across clusters. Digital News business delivered 20 percent growth in revenue, driven by intellectual property events and video monetisation across digital platforms.  10) Increase in tax cost and debt on books  Tax expenses for the quarter ended December increased by 22.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,345 crore, while the depreciation jumped by 26.7 percent to Rs 12,903 crore for the quarter on expanded asset base across all the businesses, higher network utilisation in the digital services business and ramp-up in upstream production.  The company's finance costs during the quarter increased by 11.3 percent to Rs 5,789 crore compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher loan balances and higher interest rates.  The outstanding debt on its books at the end of December FY24 stood at Rs 3,11,743 crore, increasing from Rs 3,03,530 crore at the end of December FY23, while the net debt rose to Rs 1,19,372 crore, from Rs 1,10,248 crore during the same period.  However, the net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 0.67 at the end of the December quarter, from 0.72 as of the same period last year.  Reliance reported capital expenditure for the December quarter at Rs 30,102 crore with investments in pan-India 5G rollout, expansion of retail infrastructure and new energy business. The capital expenditure in the same quarter last year was Rs 37,599 crore.  Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

In a regulatory filing on January 12, billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led company said, &quot;Board of Directors of the Company is scheduled to be held on Friday, January 19, 2024, inter alia, to consider and approve the standalone and consolidated unaudited financial results of the Company for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2023.&quot;  Shares of RIL on January 12 closed 0.80 percent higher at Rs 2,740.10 apiece on BSE.  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 19,878 crore in the second quarter of the financial year 2023-24, an increase of 29.7 percent from a year ago, despite a dip in revenue from its oil-to-chemicals business. The robust performance of its retail, Jio and upstream businesses drove profit growth.  Gross revenue from operations of India’s most valued company stood at Rs 2.55 lakh crore in the quarter ended September 30, compared to Rs 2.52 lakh crore last year. RIL’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by 30.2 percent to Rs 44,867 crore in Q2FY24.  Revenue for Reliance’s O2C business, its biggest business, stood at Rs 1.47 lakh crore, a 7.3 percent decline, primarily on account of a sharp 14 percent year-on-year decline in crude oil prices that resulted in lower price realisation for products.  EBITDA for the quarter stood at Rs 16,281 crore, increasing 36 percent from the year-ago period, on account of strength in gasoline and PVC margins, optimised feedstock sourcing and lower SAED in line with the decline in middle-distillate cracks.  The company’s oil and gas revenue, representing its upstream operations, increased 71.8 percent in the quarter, driven by higher production of gas &amp;amp; oil and the commencement of condensate production from MJ field along with 6 percent higher gas price realization in KG D6.  Jio Platforms’ profit for the second quarter stood at Rs 5,297 crore, an increase of 12 percent. The telecom and streaming business segment’s revenue from operations stood at Rs 31,537 crore in the quarter, compared to Rs 28,506 crore in the same period last year. The average revenue per user (ARPU), an important metric to measure the performance of telecom companies, improved 2.5 percent YoY to Rs 181.7 per user, per month.  Reliance Retail posted a net profit of Rs 2,790 crore in the quarter, an increase of 21 percent. Revenue from operations for the quarter stood at Rs 77,148 crore, a growth of 18.8 percent YoY.

RI,2023-12-28T15:08:40+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Reliance to be among the world’s top 10 conglomerates: Mukesh Ambani,"Addressing employees on Reliance Family Day, the birthday of group founder Dhirubhai Ambani, Mukesh Ambani said that RIL aims to consolidate its place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption.","Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani expressed confidence in the company’s future and asserted the group’s potential to rank among the world’s top 10 business conglomerates.  Ambani emphasised that Reliance Industries, which operates the world’s largest single-location oil refining complex and telecom networks across India, will never be complacent and will continue to disrupt markets.  “We are known for disrupting the market through constant innovation and reinvention. We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records,” Ambani said, addressing employees on Reliance Family Day, the birthday of group founder Dhirubhai Ambani.  He added that his oil-chemicals-telecom conglomerate is aiming to secure its place among global leaders in digital data platforms and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.  “As India races ahead to become the world’s third-largest economy, an unprecedented opportunity awaits Reliance. Reliance can …. and Reliance will … grow to be among the Top 10 business conglomerates of the world. For this, we need to be laser-focused on three things,” he said.  Reliance started as a small textile manufacturing unit in Mumbai but then ventured into the petrochemical sector to provide feedstock for textiles, ultimately becoming the nation’s largest producer. Subsequently, it set up the largest oil refinery in the country and then expanded it to the world’s biggest single-location refining complex.  In 2005, it entered the retail sector and is now the largest operator of grocery stores, hypermarkets, and online retail in the country. In 2016, it launched the telecom service Jio, which quickly became the largest operator in India and the third largest in the world.  Today, Reliance is building giga-scale factories for new energy businesses and has also forayed into financial services.  Today, Reliance is building massive factories for new energy ventures and has also ventured into financial services.  “We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records. This is how Reliance has achieved perennial growth,” Ambani said.  On artificial intelligence (AI), Ambani said Reliance Industries must “boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation.”  “We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,” he said, adding that growth engines of Reliance – digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, O2C (oil-to ) and materials business, and health and life sciences — will have to complete this transformation by next year.  Reliance is India’s largest corporation by revenue, profit and market value.  Ambani asked employees to be ‘laser-focused’ on providing extreme value to customers through collaboration and systems improvement. “In the coming years, we must continue to strive even harder to develop products and services that no one has created ever before,” he said.  At the same time, the company’s actions must always win community trust, he said, adding that the group must continuously enrich competencies and capabilities.  “When all our businesses grow exponentially, we can contribute more to India’s inclusive prosperity and make the world a better place,” he said.  Ambani said his three key messages for the New Year are to consolidate Reliance’s place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption, consolidate its place among global leaders in talent enrichment, and secure its place among global leaders in institutional culture.  “As Reliance reinvents itself to become a unique new-age technology company, we need to boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation.  “In the era of digital platforms, data has become a new factor of production along with talent and money. We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,” he said.  All growth engines of Reliance -- digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and materials business, and health and life sciences -- will have to complete this transformation by next year, he said.  “Furthermore, we should accelerate our efforts to become a pioneer in developing AI to address, at scale, India’s urgent national priorities in education, healthcare, agriculture, and employment creation,” he said.  To make Reliance an AI-immersive tech company, it needs to build the necessary talent, skill sets and competencies at all levels within the organisation, Ambani said. “We should expand and deepen our talent pool to be amongst the best in the world. Investment in talent brings higher returns than investment in machines,” he added.  On institutional culture, Ambani said the most important tenet of Reliance’s culture is to work with the founder’s mindset. “It means working with the ownership mindset.”  “Each and every one of you become an owner of Reliance when you own the founder’s purpose and passion,” he told employees.  For the younger generation joining the business, Ambani said, “Young leaders will commit mistakes. That’s for sure...But my advice to them is simple: Do not waste your energy on conducting a post-mortem on past mistakes. Rather, learn not to repeat the same mistakes.” Ambani said Reliance must be forever kept young by ensuring that the average age of all teams remains in the 30s.  He also advised the employees to “be bold, courageous and adventurous in pursuing your present and future goals.”  “Let me reiterate: The future of Reliance belongs to Akash, Isha, Anant and their generation,” he said, referring to his three children and also mentioning that at a time when Reliance is undergoing a Generational Transition, “I attach immense importance to further strengthening this unique Institutional Culture.”  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

According to a Bloomberg survey of 14 brokerages, the conglomerate’s consolidated net sales are expected to come in at Rs 2.14 lakh crore and net profit is estimated at Rs 16,995.50 crore according to seven brokerages. The company is scheduled to report its June quarter earnings on July 21.  &quot;EBITDA to marginally increase by 1 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 38,800 crore, with O2C EBITDA down 4 percent to Rs 15,600 crore on lower GRMs, partly offset by a recovery in the petchem margins. We expect net subscriber addition of 6.5 million for Jio, with a 1 percent higher ARPU at Rs 180. Retail EBITDA should be up 2 percent QoQ to Rs 5,000 crore, while upstream EBITDA would be largely flat. We estimate consolidated adjusted PAT, after JPL-RRVL MI, to decline 14 percent to Rs 16,500 crore, on higher ETR quarter on quarter at 22 percent,&quot; said Emkay Research in a note to investors.  The Mukesh Ambani led-conglomerate hit its 52-week high on the bourses on June 19 at Rs 2,855.00 a share on BSE ahead of the result, driven by the demerger of its financial services arm. On July 20 at closing, shares were settled at Rs 2619.80, up 1.2 percent from its previous close.  Although RIL does not report gross refining margins (GRMs) separately, analysts expect that it would have achieved GMRs of $11 a barrel in the June quarter compared to the implied GRM of $13/barrel in Q4FY23. It is seen following the declining trend in benchmark Singapore GRM, which has plunged over 70 percent year-on-year and close to 50 percent QoQ on weak demand.  The analysts predict that the company's petrochemical EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) is likely to remain relatively unchanged QoQ due to limited pricing power in the market. The ample supply and insufficient demand are the primary factors contributing to this situation. In the ‘oil and gas’ segment, EBIT is expected to have remained stable, with a modest 1.6 percent QoQ increase in revenues.  Brokerage firm JP Morgan predicts that Reliance Jio will maintain its pattern of quarterly net subscriber additions and experience a slightly higher average revenue per user (ARPU) in the first quarter. As for Reliance Retail, it is expected to achieve a YoY revenue growth of 25 percent. This growth will be driven by the expansion of stores and the acquisition of floor space, particularly in the grocery segment. JP Morgan also foresees that Reliance Retail's revenue growth will surpass that of its competitors in the industry.  &quot;We expect Jio to report strong net adds of 7 million in Q1 (vs 6.4 million in Q4) and largely flattish ARPU leading to overall revenue growth of 1.6 percent QoQ. Jio, unlike Bharti, didn't have any benefits from the minimum tariff recharge. Furthermore, we think as Jio's 5G network is deepening, a lesser number of users did top-ups in this IPL-heavy quarter as 5G provided better speeds,&quot; said BofA in its note.  &quot;We expect steady momentum at retail and factor in 22 percent YoY growth (19 percent in Q4) led by continued uptake in grocery and fashion business. We model a flattish QoQ EBITDA margin of 7.1 percent and EBIT margin of 5.4 percent,&quot; the report added.  According to analysts, the focus is likely to shift towards expectations for significant announcements during the annual general meeting (AGM), which is anticipated to take place in August. Historically, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) uses the AGM as a platform to reveal value-unlocking catalysts and outline future growth plans.  At the last AGM on August 30, Mukesh Ambani told shareholders that he will share an update on the planned initial public offer (IPO) of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio in the AGM next year. Hence, analysts expect noteworthy announcements to be made during this year's AGM.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

RI,2023-06-01T15:00:51+05:30,PTI,Reliance's operating performance to remain resilient: S&amp;P,"The rating agency affirmed its 'BBB+' rating - equivalent to the sovereign rating assigned to India - to Reliance (RIL) with a stable outlook, reflecting the view that RIL's cash flows will help it preserve its financial profile, despite elevated investments over the next 24 months.","Reliance Industries Ltd's operating performance is likely to remain resilient over the next two years, as the firm's growing presence in the digital and retail segments will temper softer earnings in the energy business, S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings said on Thursday.  The rating agency affirmed its 'BBB+' rating - equivalent to the sovereign rating assigned to India - to Reliance (RIL) with a stable outlook, reflecting the view that RIL's cash flows will help it preserve its financial profile, despite elevated investments over the next 24 months.  In a statement, S&amp;amp;P said Reliance's expansion plans for the next two years are manageable. Capex will remain elevated, but lower than the levels of fiscal 2023 (ended March 31, 2023).  The company's leverage will remain at a level commensurate with the current rating, it said. &quot;RIL's operating performance will remain resilient over the next 24 months,&quot; it said. &quot;Earnings growth from RIL's digital and retail segments will continue. This will temper weakness in the O2C business.&quot;  The company, which operates the world's largest single-location oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat and is India's biggest petrochemical producer, has in recent years diversified into telecom and digital space, including OTT as well as physical and online retail.  &quot;We believe the company's oil-to-chemicals (O2C - a significant contributor to the company's revenue and EBITDA) segment will continue to maintain more stable and superior margins relative to peers'. This is because RIL is one of the largest and most complex refiners globally.  &quot;The company should therefore be able to withstand a likely weakening in refining margins in Asia amid an economic slowdown and a high base,&quot; S&amp;amp;P said.  Petrochemical demand, it said, is expected to pick up, with China reopening its economy earlier this year, after a pandemic-induced lockdown. This will drive up petrochemical margins from the lows of fiscal 2023.  &quot;We expect EBITDA for RIL's O2C segment to decline 23 per cent in fiscal 2024, before improving 6 per cent to Rs 50,500 crore in fiscal 2025. EBITDA was Rs 62,100 crore in fiscal 2023,&quot; it said.  Earnings in the digital services segment will benefit from increasing data demand and resultant upgrades to higher-priced telecom plans. Meanwhile, new store openings and the proliferation of e-commerce will support the retail business.  &quot;We project RIL's adjusted annual EBITDA will be Rs 1.3 lakh crore to Rs 1.5 lakh crore over the next two years, compared with Rs 1.4 lakh crore in fiscal 2023. We expect the digital and retail segments to constitute about 60 per cent of RIL's total EBITDA by fiscal 2025, compared with 25 per cent in fiscal 2019,&quot; the rating agency said.  RIL's investment plans are sizable but manageable.  &quot;The company's strategy to diversify and dominate its related industries has pushed up its investment spending. We expect this momentum to continue, with annual capital investments of Rs 1.1 lakh crore to Rs 1.2 lakh crore over the next two years,&quot; it said, adding the leverage will remain at a level commensurate with the 'BBB+' ratings.  Resilient earnings and RIL's commitment to keeping its balance sheet in check will support leverage.  &quot;The stable outlook reflects our expectation that RIL's strengthening cash flows and disciplined spending will help the company to preserve its financial profile over the next 12-24 months,&quot; it said.  S&amp;amp;P said it could lower the rating if RIL's capital expenditure, including acquisitions in digital or retail businesses, is higher than expected or cash flow projection for the company reduces due to lower earnings stemming from underperformance in any key business.  The rating could be raised if the company demonstrates a track record of conservative financial policy, such that its debt-to-EBITDA stays well below 2x. A higher rating could also require the digital and retail segments' competitiveness to further strengthen.  Disclaimer:  Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

RI,2023-05-30T12:29:46+05:30,PTI,"After Reliance-bp, Nayara Energy sells petrol, diesel at Re 1 less than PSUs","While state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) continue to hold prices despite a drop in international rates, private fuel retailers have started passing on the benefit to consumers.","After Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner bp plc of the UK, Nayara Energy - the nation's largest private fuel retailer - has started selling petrol and diesel at Re 1 less than the fuel sold by state-owned retailers, officials said.  While state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) continue to hold prices despite a drop in international rates, private fuel retailers have started passing on the benefit to consumers.  &quot;To further stimulate domestic consumption and cater to local customers better, we have introduced a Re 1 discount in our retail outlets until the end of June 2023,&quot; a spokesperson for Nayara Energy said.  &quot;We believe in being a strong partner to India's energy needs and will continue to serve the country's consumption demand.&quot; Nayara Energy, which owns over 7 per cent of India's 86,925 petrol pumps, is selling petrol and diesel at Re 1 per litre less than that by IOC, BPCL and HPCL in 10 states such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan.  Earlier this month, Jio-bp, the retail fuel joint venture of Reliance and bp, started selling superior grade diesel at Re 1 per litre cheaper than normal or regular grade diesel sold by state-owned companies.  The additive-enhanced diesel helps clean dirt deposits in engines and can improve fuel efficiency.  While Reliance-bp has priced only diesel less than that of PSUs, Nayara is selling both diesel and petrol at rates below state-owned firms'.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL had frozen retail prices when international oil prices climbed in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. While international oil prices have declined, retail prices continue to be on hold for a record 14th month in a row as they recoup the losses suffered last year.  Prices of crude oil, which is turned into fuels like petrol and diesel at refineries, shot above USD 100 per barrel on concerns of supply disruptions in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year. While there was no supply disruption, rates continued to remain firm for months thereafter.  To insulate domestic consumers, they stopped daily price revisions from April 6, 2022. As a result of selling fuel below cost, IOC, BPCL and HPCL posted a combined net loss of Rs 21,201.18 crore during April-September.  During this period, private fuel retailers Reliance BP Mobility Ltd (RBML), Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy and Shell lost market share as they were unable to match the below-cost frozen rates of dominant public sector retailers.  But a fall in international oil prices since March has helped bring their retail prices at par with PSU competition or at market price.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL too have broken even but continue to hold retail prices to recoup past losses. This has helped IOC and BPCL post profits in 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) fiscal year despite losses in the first half.  Industry sources said Nayara started pricing petrol and diesel at market rates sometime in March and RBML's 1,574 petrol pumps began selling diesel at par from this month.  This month, Jio-bp introduced superior-grade diesel at rates lower than even the normal diesel sold by state-owned firms. Nayara has followed suit with a similar discount on both petrol and diesel in 10 states.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL first froze petrol and diesel rates for 137 days beginning early November 2021 when five states including Uttar Pradesh went to the polls. A second round of hiatus began on April 6, 2022, and is continuing.  Nayara Energy owns 6,376 petrol pumps in the country. IOC, BPCL and HPCL own 78,567 out of 86,925 petrol pumps in the country.",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/after-reliance-bp-nayara-energy-sells-petrol-diesel-at-re-1-less-than-psus_17048391.html

On April 3, OPEC+, announced a surprise supply cut of around 1.16 million barrels per day (bpd), in addition to the earlier cuts, from May till the end of 2023. In October 2022, OPEC had agreed to cut production by 2 million bpd.  Crude oil prices have been on an upward trajectory since the OPEC announcement. US benchmark Brent crude, which had slumped to $72 per barrel, is now trading around $85 per barrel.  “The challenges that we have to look out for is that if there are oil production cuts and prices go up whether it has an impact on demand. One would also look out for any increase in product exports from China,” Srikanth said.  He said that the company will also monitor potential economic contraction in EU and US as it may impact India’s downstream exports.  Reliance Industries on April 21 reported 19.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated profit at Rs 19,299 crore for the quarter ended March of the financial year 2022-23. Gross revenue from operations of India's most valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.  Gas outlook  Indian gas market outlook remains positive due to lower global prices and higher domestic gas availability, said Srikanth.  Lower global prices make gas more competitive and give more choices to buyers, he said.  RIL operating income from its oil and gas business was at an 8-year high with steady KG D6 production at around 19 mmscmd and higher energy prices. Gas production at KG D6 is likely to increase to 30 mmscmd in FY24 with commissioning of the MJ field, RIL added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/reliance-industries-monitoring-opecsupply-cut-impactprice-demand-cfo_16968081.html

The profit beat estimates driven by a strong performance across businesses.  Gross revenue from operations of India's most valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.  The bottom line of the Mukesh Ambani-led company was expected to grow in single digits year-on-year (YoY). Analysts estimated Reliance Industries  to post an average net profit of Rs 16,573 crore.  EBITDA increased by 21.8 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 41,389 crore on account of higher revenue and increase in margins in the digital services segment, the company said in a release.  Sourcing benefits and operating efficiencies in the retail segment also helped. Higher transportation fuel cracks and optimised feedstock cost were partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins in Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) segment.  “O2C segment posted its highest-ever operating profit despite global uncertainties and disruptions in commodity trade flows. Our oil and gas segment also delivered very strong growth and is now poised to contribute nearly 30 percent of India’s domestic gas production,” said Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries.  RIL also witnessed better gas price realization and higher volumes in the oil and gas segment.  “I am happy to note Reliance’s initiatives in digital connectivity and organized retail are driving greater efficiencies in the economy and contributing to India’s emergence as one of the fastest growing economies in the world,” said Ambani.  “This year we have proposed to demerge our financial services arm and list the new entity “Jio Financial Services Ltd. This gives our shareholders an opportunity to participate in an exciting new growth platform from inception.”  Capital expenditure in FY23 was at Rs 1.41 lakh crore, and net debt as of 31st March 2023 stood at Rs 1.10 lakh crore. Venkatachari Srikanth, chief financial officer for the company, said the increase in net debt was due to working capital and translation impact on foreign currency liabilities. He further added that internal accruals would continue to fund the company’s growth plans, as seen over the last two years, where cash profits had covered 98 percent of the capital expenditure. “The emphasis remains on discipline in capital allocation to support growth initiatives. We believe that it will be largely funded through internal accruals,” he said.  Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms' profit for the quarter came in at Rs 4,984 crore, up 15.6 percent. Revenue from operations for the company, which houses Reliance's telecom and streaming businesses, increased 14.4 percent YoY to Rs 25,465 crore.  Revenue from operations increased primarily driven by a sustained increase in subscriber base for the connectivity business while strong EBITDA growth was led by higher revenue and increase in margins.  Average revenue per user (ARPU), an important metric to measure the performance of telecom companies, also improved 6.7 percent YoY to Rs 178.8 per user per month. Quarter on quarter it improved by 60 paise per user.  &quot;Jio has taken formidable strides in pioneering 5G rollout across the country with unmatched speed of execution,&quot; said Akash M Ambani, chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited.  This has led to a significant improvement in customer experience, reflected in the higher engagement levels among Jio users. &quot;Jio remains committed to build a robust digital society with tailormade technology platforms which will drive sustained growth in earning and value for all stakeholders,&quot; he added.  Also Read: Reliance Jio FY23 EBITDA up a solid 24.2% on strong revenue growth of 17.9%  Retail Business  Reliance Retail delivered a robust performance with another quarter of strong revenue growth and profit performance. The bottom line grew by 12.9 percent YoY to Rs 2,415 crore while revenue from operations stood at Rs 61,559 crore, up 21.1 percent YoY. Store footfalls was at 219 million, the highest ever, up from 201 million in Q3FY23.  RIL said the business continued to invest in strengthening its supply chain capabilities by expanding over 1.7 million sq. ft. of warehouse space. Digital Commerce and New Commerce contributed to 17 percent of revenue.  &quot;In last 10 years, we have allocated capital to consumer-centric businesses which has transformed the earning mix and positioned us as a consumer and tech company,&quot; Srikanth said.  The company said focus will remain on expanding distribution reach across geographies for this segment.  Also Read: Reliance Retail Q4: Net profit up 13% at Rs 2,415 crore on highest ever footfalls  O2C  Revenue for the O2C business fell by 11.8 percent YoY to Rs 1,28,633 crore. Exports dropped 0.4 percent to Rs 78,851 crore. EBITDA, meanwhile, improved 14.4 percent to Rs 16,293 crore.  EBITDA margin was at 12.7 percent, an increase of 290 bps YoY led by strength in transportation fuel cracks, optimized feedstock cost and advantageous ethane cracking economics. This was partially offset by lower polyester chain margins. Special additional excise duty on transportation fuels adversely impacted earnings by Rs 711 crore. The full year impact of special additional excise duty on transportation fuels on earnings was at Rs 6,648 crore.  Commenting on the O2C business' full-year performance, Srikanth said the vertical had benefited strong global oil demand. “We had a better margin capture and also superior product placement. Higher fuel cracks offset weak downstream margins,” he said.  The O2C business includes refining, petrochemicals, fuel retailing through Reliance BP Mobility Limited, aviation fuel and bulk wholesale marketing.  Oil &amp;amp; Gas  Oil &amp;amp; Gas revenue more than doubled to Rs 4,556 crore as compared to Q4FY22, mainly on account of higher price realisation and 13 percent increase in KGD6 gas production. The average price realised for KGD6 was at $11.39 /MMBTU in the March quarter, against $6.13 / MMBTU a year ago. MMBTU is Metric Million British Thermal Unit. KGD6 gas production likely to increase to 30 mmscmd in FY24 with commissioning of MJ field, where testing and commissioning is underway.  EBITDA increased sharply to Rs 3,801 crore, which was up almost 2.5x on YoY basis. EBITDA margin was at 83.4 percent for Q4FY23 up by about 60 bps as compared to Q4FY22.  The company expects the gas market environment in India to remain positive in the medium term, while global gas price are likely to remain volatile with demand uncertainties and higher EU storage.  In the current financial quarter, Reliance Industries said it has sold the entire volume of 6 MMSCMD in an e-auction held on April 12 and the Gas sale purchase agreement (GSPA) is under execution with successful bidders.  Media  RIL's media business reported a loss of 35 crore for the quarter. Revenue fell 8.5 percent to Rs 1,484 crore.  TV News segment grew, driven by the growth in advertising revenue. Excluding movie production segment which has project-based volatility, revenue was marginally up with growth across all verticals, RIL said.  TV News reported a sharp QoQ improvement in EBITDA and margins. Consolidated EBITDA was down primarily due to Viacom18’s investments in new initiatives (Sports and Digital verticals had an impact of Rs 170 crore on EBITDA) and a lag in recovery of ad revenues.

RI,2022-10-21T22:03:17+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Ten takeaways from Reliance results as conglomerate posts record Q2 for consumer businesses,"The increase of 32.4 percent in gross revenue was driven by higher realisation in O2C business with sharp increase in energy prices. Revenue growth also reflected continued growth momentum across consumer businesses, the company said","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries on October 21 reported a record performance in consumer businesses which continued to scale new milestones every quarter, but its performance in the O2C (oil-to-chemical) business reflected subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products.  Here are 10 key highlights from the quarterly earnings scorecard:  1) Profit  Reliance registered a 0.2 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 15,512 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, with cash profit growing 15.4 percent to Rs 27,614 crore for the same period.  Its other income during the quarter fell by 16.8 percent to Rs 3,514 crore YoY.  2) Topline  The gross revenue for the quarter at Rs 2.53 lakh crore was higher by 32.4 percent compared to year-ago period, while revenue from operations increased by 33.7 percent to Rs 2.32 lakh crore.  The increase of 32.4 percent in gross revenue was driven by higher realization in O2C business with sharp increase in energy prices. Revenue growth also reflects continued growth momentum across consumer businesses, the company said.  Also read - RIL to demerge financial services undertaking and list Jio Financial Services  3) Operating Performance  At the operating level, Reliance said EBITDA (excluding the impact of special additional excise duty related costs of Rs 4,039 crore) for the quarter was Rs 38,702 crore, a 27.8 percent growth over a year-ago period. EBITDA including the impact of special additional excise duty stood at Rs 34,663 crore, up 14.5 percent YoY.  The growth in EBITDA was driven by positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies in retail segment, higher gas price realization with increase in ceiling price, increase in ARPU and customer engagement in digital services segment.  4) Finance Cost  Reliance said its finance cost increased by 19.2 percent to Rs 4,554 crore during the quarter YoY, due to higher loan balances and tightening of monetary policy by central banks.  5) Debts and Cash  It has an outstanding debt as of September 2022 of Rs 2.94 lakh crore or $36.2 billion, while the cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 2.01 lakh crore ($24.8 billion).  The capital expenditure for the quarter was Rs 32,534 crore and additionally, it incurred expenses of Rs 88,078 crore for acquisition of spectrum by RJIL.  Also read - Reliance Retail reports 36% YoY jump in Q2 net profit to Rs 2,305 crore  6) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms, which owns Jio, recorded a 26.9 percent year-on-year growth in profit at Rs 4,729 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, backed by strong topline and operating performance.  Revenue from operations for the quarter at Rs 24,275 crore for the quarter increased by 22.7 percent year-on-year aided by increase in average revenue per user (ARPU).  ARPU during the quarter at Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month grew at a healthy pace of 23.5 percent growth on YoY basis, while the data traffic increased by 22.7 percent YoY to 28.2 billion GB during the quarter.  Total customer base of Jio as of September FY23 stood at 427.6 million.  &quot;We saw consistent net subscriber additions and higher engagement in digital services segment,&quot; said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director.  Jio Platforms registered a massive 29.2 percent year-on-year growth in EBITDA at Rs 12,011 crore driven by strong revenue growth and margin improvement. The margin at 49.5 percent expanded by 250 bps YoY due to increase in ARPU, which partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs.  7) Reliance Retail  Reliance Retail delivered record revenue and profits during the quarter led by broad-based growth across all consumer baskets, with revenue growing a massive 44.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 57,694 crore and profit increasing 36 percent YoY to Rs 2,305 crore.  The business expanded its physical store network with 795 new store openings, taking the total store count at the end of the quarter to 16,617 stores with an area of 54.5 million square feet, Reliance said.  Retail EBITDA from operations increased 75.9 percent YoY to Rs 4,286 crore in Q2FY23, with a 130 basis point margin improvement over the same time last year resulting from favourable mix, positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies.  As consumers returned to stores, Reliance Retail received over 180 million footfalls across formats and geographies in the quarter, a growth of 23 percent over pre-COVID period, the company said.  8) Oil To Chemicals  The oil to chemicals (O2C) business reported a 32.5 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.59 lakh crore, primarily on account of higher crude oil prices.  Crude oil benchmarks rose YoY due to recovering oil demand, aggressive production cuts announced by OPEC+, limited spare capacity and imminent European Union sanctions on Russian oil exports. Dated Brent crude averaged $100.9 a barrel in Q2FY23, rising by $27.4 a barrel YoY, but declined by $13 per barrel QoQ.  RIL's production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent YoY to 16.2 MMT with planned turnaround of primary and secondary units of SEZ refinery for maintenance &amp;amp; inspection.  &quot;Performance of O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products. Transportation fuel margins were better than last year but significantly lower sequentially,&quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  He further said the segment performance was also impacted by the introduction of special additional excise duties during the quarter to ensure stable supply and lower volatility in the domestic market.  At the operating level, its EBITDA declined by 5.9 percent YoY to Rs 11,968 crore primarily on account of introduction of special additional excise duty on transportation fuels and lower polymer deltas, with margin falling by 310 bps YoY to 7.5 percent.  9) Exports  Exports (including deemed exports) from RIL's India operations increased by 57.5 percent to Rs 86,382 crore compared to year-ago period, mainly due to higher price realizations despite lower downstream product volumes.  10) Oil &amp;amp; Gas  &quot;Domestic oil &amp;amp; gas business continued to deliver robust performance maintaining production at 19 MMSCMD levels in the KG D6 block, significantly enhancing energy security for the country. We are confident of commissioning MJ Fields by year-end,&quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  The oil &amp;amp; gas segment clocked a 134.4 percent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 3,853 crore led by higher production and improved gas price realization.  KG-D6 gas production during the quarter was at 41 BCF (RIL's share) against 39.2 BCF (billions of cubic feet) production in Q2FY22.  Average gas price realisation for KG-D6 increased sharply to $9.86 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBTU) during the quarter compared to $3.62 per MMBTU in Q2FY22, with raising of gas price ceiling by the Government of India for first half of FY23, Reliance said.  Oil &amp;amp; gas segment reported nearly 3 times YoY increase in EBITDA to Rs 3,171 crore for the quarter, with margin expanding by 12.6 percentage points to 82.3 percent.

Excluding for the impact of the special excise duty, consolidated operating profit in the reported quarter rose 27.8 percent on-year to Rs 38,702 crore.  Overall, RIL's operating profit at the consolidated level was aided by the record quarterly operating profit reported by its arms Reliance Retail and Jio Platforms.  &quot;I am pleased with the record performance of our consumer businesses which continue to scale new milestones every quarter,&quot; Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said in a press statement.  RIL said that its overall outstanding debt as on September 30, 2022 was at Rs 2.94 lakh crore while cash and cash equivalents stood at Rs 2.01 lakh crore. Net debt, therefore, rose to Rs 93,253 crore.  RIL’s debt increased in the quarter due to higher working capital given the significant dislocation in energy markets, impact of foreign currency liabilities as rupee depreciated against the US dollar and payment of first installment for spectrum, said Srikanth Venkatachari, joint chief financial officer at the conglomerate.  Oil-to-chemical  The oil-to-chemical business of RIL saw strong growth in topline with sales jumping 32.5 percent on-year to Rs 1.6 lakh crore. However, the segment's operating profit fell 5.9 percent on-year to Rs 11,968 crore owing to decline in global refining margins and government's special excise duty.  &quot;Performance of our O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products,&quot; Ambani said.  RIL’s production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent year-on-year with planned turnaround of primary and secondary units of special economic zone (SEZ) refinery for M&amp;amp;A.  RIL said its joint venture with Bp continued to face adverse market conditions due to retail fuel prices remaining capped despite higher global crude oil prices.  &quot;Jio-bp is committed to safeguarding interest of channel partners while meeting universal service obligations,&quot; RIL said.  Jio Platforms  The digital services business of RIL, which included Reliance Jio, had a strong quarter on a sequential basis.  The segment's operating profit jumped 5.1 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis to Rs 12,011 crore, aided by strong addition of new customers and benefit of recent tariff hikes at the telecom subsidiary.  Reliance Jio added net new subscribers to the tune of 7.7 million in the September quarter, taking the total user base to 427.6 million as of September 30.  The operating margin of the digital services business also saw a marked improvement to 49.5 percent in the reported quarter from 48.7 percent in the previous quarter.  Organised Retail  The organised retail segment had a record quarter, aided by the full re-opening of the domestic economy post the COVID-19 related restrictions seen through large parts of 2021-22.  The segment's revenues jumped 44.5 percent on-year to Rs 57,694 crore in the reported quarter, which was aided by strong new store additions and footfalls. RIL said it received over 180 million footfalls in the September quarter, which was a 23 percent jump over pre-COVID-19 levels.  During the quarter, the company opened 795 new stores to take the total store count to 16,617.  &quot;The quarter was marked by an operating environment at par with pre-COVID levels as the impact of pandemic waned,&quot; RIL said.  The oil-to-chemical major said that across town classes, consumer sentiments remained positive on the back of key promotional events and early onset of festivities.  &quot;Overall, the results reflect strong operational execution that keeps it well poised to deliver sustainable growth in the period ahead,&quot; RIL said.  Oil &amp;amp; Gas  The oil and gas production business of RIL benefitted from the surge in domestic administered natural gas prices during the quarter.  RIL reported a 134.4 percent year-on-year surge in revenues to Rs 3,853 crore, driven by higher realisation for the natural gas that the company produces from difficult-to-produce fields.  Operating profit of the segment nearly tripled on a year-on-year basis to Rs 3,171 crore in the quarter while operating margins rose 17.2 percentage points to 82.3 percent.  During the quarter, RIL produced 43.6 billions of cubic feet equivalent as against 52 billions of cubic feet equivalent in the year ago quarter.  Media  The media and broadcasting business reported a 11.7 percent year-on-year growth in revenues to Rs 1,549 crore during the reported quarter.  The segment's operating profit plummeted 87.4 percent on-year to Rs 32 crore while operating margins shrank to 2.1 percent from 18.2 percent a year-ago.  RIL said that the business faced issues from a challenging advertising environment, flat subscription revenue and advertisement revenue loss from removal of Hindi GEC from DD FreeDish.  &quot;Advertising environment during the quarter was subdued as brands held back advertising spends on new product launches and sustenance campaigns due to the continued inflationary headwinds,&quot; RIL said.  On October 21, shares of Reliance Industries ended 1.2 percent lower at Rs 2,470 on the NSE.  (Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

On a sequential basis, the profit grew by 4 percent.  The company recorded revenue of Rs 22,521 crore for the quarter under review, up 20 percent from a year ago. Sequentially, revenue increased by 3 percent.  Performance was driven by higher net customer additions and an increase in average revenue per user.  The average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month saw a healthy 23.5 percent growth compared to the year-ago period due to better seasonality and improving subscriber mix, Reliance Industries said in its BSE filing.  The net subscriber addition was healthy at 7.7 million as gross addition remained strong at 32.7 million in Q2FY23.

The revenue from operations grew by 22.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 24,275 crore driven by an ARPU increase for the connectivity business.  At the operating level, Jio Platforms recorded a 29.2 percent year-on-year increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at Rs 12,011 crore led by strong revenue growth and margin improvement.  The margin at 49.5 percent increased by 250 bps YoY due to ARPU's increase in connectivity business partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs, Reliance said.

RI,2022-10-20T17:23:10+05:30,Chiranjivi Chakraborty,"Preview: RIL’s Q2 consolidated net profit seen rising 12% YoY, driven by telecom, retail business","Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm are expected to have performed well, driven by high customer acquisitions in telecom and strong footfalls in retail","Oil refining to retail and telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd is expected to report double-digit growth in consolidated net profit and revenue for the quarter ended September 30, according to a Moneycontrol poll.  The company is likely to report a 12 percent on-year increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 15,263 crore in the September quarter, according to the average of estimates by six securities firms.  The company will report its September quarter earnings on October 21.  Profit will be driven by strong consolidated revenue, which is expected to rise 34 percent on year on year to Rs 2.25 lakh crore in the quarter.    Revenue will be aided by strength in the energy business, which will benefit from better gross refining margins and strong demand compared to the year-ago quarter.  A robust performance by the telecom and retail business, in particular, will boost on-year revenue.  The retail business should have benefited from strong footfalls and demand compared to the year-ago quarter, when the business was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Full reopening of the economy in the quarter gone by, along with strong festive demand, should have helped the retail business deliver strong sales growth.  Energy business   While the year-on-year performance of RIL’s oil-to-chemical vertical will be strong, its sequential growth could have been soft due to a decline in global gross refining margins from their lifetime highs in the June quarter as well as the imposition of additional duties on the export of refining products imposed by the government.  “Energy markets have been volatile in the past quarter, and windfall taxes added to challenges,” Morgan Stanley, which has an ‘overweight’ rating on RIL, wrote in a preview on the earnings.  Morgan Stanley said RIL’s earnings may have fallen sequentially as the oil-to-chemicals business was affected by refinery shutdowns, the windfall fuel export tax, and lower product cracks.  Singapore’s Gross Refining Margin (GRM), a key benchmark to gauge refining margins in Asia, plummeted 51 percent sequentially to $9.1 per barrel in the September quarter because of a decline in gasoline and fuel oil cracks.  The sharp decline in the Singapore GRM will have an impact on RIL’s margin, but continued strength in middle distillate products like diesel and air turbine fuel should have offset some of the impact, analysts said.  Retail and telecom   Analysts expect no surprises in the earnings performance of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm in the September quarter. On a sequential basis, both verticals are expected to have performed well, driven by high customer acquisitions in telecom and strong footfalls in retail.  IIFL Securities sees the retail segment registering 36 percent on-year growth in sales and a 7.5 percent core margin in the September quarter.  On the telecom side, acquisition of new customers and recent tariff hikes should result in 3-5 percent sequential growth in revenue.  Analysts expect the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of Reliance Jio to rise 1.9 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis from Rs 176 reported in the previous quarter.  Jio is estimated to have added more than 9 million net new users in the September quarter, analysts said.  “Sequential ARPU improvement is backed by residual impact of the past tariff hike (higher proportion of longer-dated plans),” Emkay Global Financial Services said.

Read full...",RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani was also optimistic that India’s telecom industry is ready to take leadership in the global space,"Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on October 1 said that telecom company Jio will launch 5G services across India by December 2023. Ambani was speaking at the India Mobile Congress (IMC) 2022 event, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi “launched” 5G tech in India.  He also said that India’s telecom industry is “ready to take leadership” and that government action is “crafting India into the 5G era, this is more than the next-gen of telecom”.  Follow our LIVE coverage of PM Modi’s 5G launch in India  Read the text of Ambani’s full special address at the IMC event below:  Most respected Prime Minister Shri Narendrabhai Modiji,  Honourable Minister Shri Vaishnawji,  Honourable Minister of State Shri Chauhanji,  Secretary Telecom Shri Rajaramanji,  My good friends from the industry, Sunil and Kumar,  Distinguished delegates,  Ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning.  My hearty congratulations to DoT and COAI for organising the sixth edition of the Indian Mobile Congress.  I can whole-heartedly say today that as Indian telecom industry, what we have demonstrated, I feel very proud. And to both COAI and DoT I can say that we are now ready to take leadership and the Indian Mobile Congress should now become the Asian Mobile Congress and the Global Mobile Congress.  Today is also very special because it coincides with our national celebration of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav.  Our beloved Prime Minister, Shri Narendrabhai Modi ji, has shared an inspiring vision of making India a developed nation by 2047. Every policy and every action of the government is skillfully crafted to propel India towards that goal.  The steps taken to fast-track India’s march into the 5G era provide a compelling proof of our Prime Minister’s determination. This is most heartening because 5G is much more than the next generation of connectivity technology. To my mind, It is a foundational technology that unlocks the full potential of other 21st century technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Robotics, Blockchain, and Metaverse.  In fact, I think of 5G as an acronym for “5 Goals” that fundamentally can transform our nation:  1.          5G and 5G-enabled digital solutions can bring affordable and high-quality education and skill development within the reach of common Indians. This will help young Indians realise their full potential by arming them with world class capabilities and competencies so that they can earn more and make India globally competitive.  2.          5G can affordably deliver high-quality healthcare to rural and remote areas by turning existing hospitals into smart hospitals without much additional investment. This will make services of best doctors digitally available anywhere in India, dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of diagnostics, and enable real-time clinical decision making. All this will enhance health, wealth and happiness of all Indians.  3.          5G can bridge the gap between urban and rural India by accelerating digitisation and intelligent data management of Agriculture, Services, Trade, Industry, Informal Sector, Transportation and Energy Infrastructure. This will create huge efficiencies in all economic activities, making India a hub of innovations, and also help us mitigate the climate crisis.  4.          5G can make available the same powerful productivity tools to small-scale industry and commercial enterprises as are used by large capital-intensive businesses. This will drive modernisation and profitability of all sectors of India’s economy.  5.          By bringing Artificial Intelligence into every domain, 5G can power India’s emergence as the world’s intelligence capital. This will help India become a major exporter of high-value added digital solutions and services.  Achieving these five goals will trigger a huge explosion of entrepreneurship in our country, which in turn will attract even larger investments and create millions of new jobs for our young people.  By harnessing the combined power of demography and digital technologies, India can become the world’s leading digital society, setting a benchmark for simultaneously achieving the dual goals of acceleration of growth and inclusion in development – acceleration of growth by making India a 40-trillion-dollar economy by 2047, up from $3 trillion today, and inclusion in development by increasing our per capita income rapidly to over $20,000, from $2,000 today.  Therefore, it will not be an exaggeration to say that 5G is like a Digital Kamadhenu, the heavenly cow that grants whatever we desire.  Esteemed dignitaries,  The rollout of 5G in India is not an ordinary event in India’s telecom history. It carries the keen expectations and the high aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians. With 5G, India will take longer and faster strides towards Sab Ka Digital Saath and Sab Ka Digital Vikas.  India may have started a little late, but I want to assure all of you, we will finish first by rolling out 5G services across the length and breadth of India. And as an industry, we will ensure that we have the highest quality and the most affordable rates than anyone else has in the world.  Today, I want to reiterate Jio’s commitment to deliver 5G to every town, every taluka, and every tehsil of our country by December 2023. Most of Jio’s 5G is developed in India, and hence carries the stamp of Atmanirbhar Bharat.  On this occasion, I would like to congratulate Honourable Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw ji and the Government of India for their efforts to strengthen BSNL. A strong BSNL will bring the balancing presence of a government entity in this very strategic sector.  Most Respected Pradhan Mantri ji,  Before I conclude, I would like to express a deep-seated emotion of pride in my heart. A pride felt by every Indian. Your leadership has raised India’s prestige, profile and power globally like never before. In today’s fast-changing world, there will be no stopping a resurgent India from soaring to the top – a place that is rightfully ours. India and Indians can’t settle for anything less. All of us at the Indian Mobile Congress assure you that we will work together and walk together under your guidance towards the glorious future that awaits our nation.  Thank you. Happy Navaratri to all of you and all my fellow Indians.  &amp;nbsp;  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Reliance Industries Ltd chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani reaffirmed his commitment to new energy during the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's 45th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 29.  Ambani said “achieving carbon neutrality globally will require multi decade of investments to the tune of $5 trillion per year, which makes Reliance’s new energy vision far more transformational and far more global”.  The company plans to invest Rs 75,000 crore in new energy.  “We have made rapid progress to create an advanced manufacturing ecosystem for new energy, which will be fully integrated, backed by world-class talent, built on pillars of technological innovation through strategic partnerships, to deliver modular, at scale, affordable and most modern manufacturing business based in India, for India and the world,” Ambani said.  Market experts said that Reliance’s big plans will ensure that the company stays highly valued even as the traditional fossil fuel companies struggle to keep their companies from getting de-rated because of ESG concerns.  Baring this year, as several companies saw stock price head higher because of a surge in oil prices and refining markets, the perception of fossil fuel companies remains poor as the world moves with greater resolve toward new energy to reduce carbon footprint.  “We are aiming for continuous hyper-growth over many decades from new energy and to establish India as a world leader in new energy advanced manufacturing”, the RIL chairman said.

Its strategic acquisitions of Lithium Werks, Faradion and a stake in Ambri have provided the company with differentiated and superior battery chemistries.

It has set the ball rolling to establish Giga scale gH2 manufacturing in India.  The company will also establish 20 GW solar generation capacity by 2025–for round-the-clock and intermittent power for gH2.  Green hydrogen is generated from electrolysis of water, with the entire process run on renewable energy.  Also read: Reliance Industries AGM 2022: RIL to build gigacomplex for power electronics  De-rating of oil companies  The traditional oil manufacturing companies the world over face the risk of getting de-rated in the event of a fall in crude prices, as future growth is likely to shift to new energy.  Even though these companies will continue to generate cash, as oil will continue to find usage the world over for years to come, these companies are likely to see a continued de-rating on future growth concerns.  Until last year, most global oil companies, including giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobile, were trading at low earnings multiples and high dividend yields because of poor investor perception.  But the story may be vastly different for Reliance, despite its dominance in the oil business. Its mega plans of becoming a global leader in new energy businesses, experts feel will not only help the company achieve its target of becoming carbon-neutral but also aid in avoiding a possible de-rating of the stock.  Also read: Mukesh Ambani explains the ‘Founder's Mindset’ for the success of RIL  RIL future-ready  Reliance has credibly proved its capability to diversify into other businesses from its traditional oil &amp;amp; gas business. Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail provide ample proof of it. But the new energy business plans ensure a multi-year growth engine even as the investor perception improves rather than deteriorates.  “With the new energy mega plan, Reliance is again going to do it directly into the new energy ecosystems which are going to replace conventional oil ecosystems,” said Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital.  “The full span from solar energy production to hydrogen technology and battery grid for energy storage makes it likely that Reliance might get entrenched in the new energy ecosystem”.  Gupta is of the opinion that the company’s return ratios could dip in the medium term while the ramp up of new tech is going on but it is unlikely that the stock will face any de-rating.  “However, the market will give credit for the capital work in progress and a premium for the new clean-tech keeping in mind that whenever Reliance has entered a new arena it has become a keystone species in that new ecosystem,” Gupta said.

RI,2022-08-26T10:36:06+05:30,Chiranjivi Chakraborty,A stock trader’s guide to Reliance Industries AGM today,"Investors expect announcements pertaining to the possible listing of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail, its new energy business, and the pricing of 5G mobile phone services.","Reliance Industries will hold its annual general meeting on Monday, an event that’s known to always move the highest-weighted stock of the Nifty 50 index.  Investors and analysts have come to expect major announcements from the conglomerate. Last year, it was the entry into green energy, and the year before, it was the induction of Google as a minority investor. In 2016, it was the launch of telecom services.  Time and Date  The AGM will be held via video conferencing for the third consecutive year on August 29. The meeting will start at 2:00 pm IST, with addresses and presentations expected from chairman Mukesh Ambani and other members of the company’s board and subsidiaries.  Also Read | Reliance to hold its 45th AGM on August 29: All you need to know  The board of directors and shareholders will then vote on 11 resolutions. Six of them are special resolutions, including the appointment of Hital Meswani as a whole-time director, and the insertion of clauses in its articles of association with respect to its new energy business.  Stock Movement  Reliance shares tend to move considerably ahead of and after the AGM. The shares have averaged negligible returns a week prior to the AGM, based on data of the past 10 years. However, they rose almost 4 percent a week after the event, Bloomberg data showed.  Additionally, the shares gained 2.3 percent a month before the AGM and returned more than 6 percent a month after the event, the data showed.  Trading in the stock tends to pick up around the annual event. On average, daily volumes on the counter have spiked 317 percent on the day of the AGM over the past five years. AGM day is easily the most active for the stock.  Big Expectations  As with every Reliance AGM, investors have a set of expectations.  This year, the focus will be on the consumer retail business once again, after chatter that a time line is likely to be announced for the listing of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail. The induction of private equity investors in both its consumer-facing subsidiaries in 2020 was seen as a stepping stone towards their eventual listing.  Brokerage JP Morgan India said in a recent note that Reliance has enhanced disclosures around related-party transactions, which is seen as a step towards greater transparency ahead of the listing.  “While it is too early to say if the increased disclosures on the large transactions between the subsidiaries are a step on the road to the listing of these businesses, it would be seen as a positive,” JP Morgan said.  Another key expectation will be around the new energy business, which emerged as the biggest takeaway at last year’s AGM. Reliance has since invested in acquiring companies in the segment and expanding capacity.  The company plans to build four gigafactories to manufacture solar panels, electric batteries, green hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells with an investment of $80 billion. The company sees renewable energy and green hydrogen as tectonic shifts in meeting the world’s energy demands.  In the company’s annual report, Ambani said he expects the green energy business to be the crown jewel of the company in the next seven years, much like he heralded the consumer-facing businesses about seven years ago.  Brokerage JM Financial said investors will await any indication of the induction of strategic investors in the company’s oil-to-chemicals and green energy business as Relance steps up activity in the space.  Attention will also be on Reliance’s plan to roll out 5G mobile phone services after the company mopped up the most spectrum in the recent auction. Reliance invested $11.3 billion to acquire 25 gigahertz of spectrum from the government.  Investors will wait for indications of the pricing of the new 5G services that step-down subsidiary Reliance Jio will offer.  Traders can expect good moves in the stock if the company were to make announcements with respect to these expectations, said dealers.  Beyond AGM  Reliance’s June quarter performance was slightly underwhelming, given the expectations built up due to the surge in global refining margins. The introduction of a special additional excise duty on refining exports also dampened spirits, but analysts remain buoyed over the stock’s prospects.  Of 39 brokerages covering the company, 31 have an outright ‘buy’ rating on the stock while three have a ‘hold’ rating with an average upside of about 12 percent expected in the scrip over the next 12 months.  UBS Securities upgraded the stock recently to a ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ as it factored in opportunities in the green energy business, which it said could create additional value of $35 billion for the company by 2030.

The financial sector reclaimed its position as the No. 1 wealth creator while public sector undertakings recorded their worst performance in 2016-21, the Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study showed. The financial sector was both the top wealth creating and top wealth destroying sector.  Equity was the biggest wealth creating asset class of the year as stock markets the world over created history by reaching record highs. The market-capitalisation of most companies and benchmark indices skyrocketed, first-time investors got attracted to the stock markets, and unprecedented liquidity was available in the market.  Adani Transmission emerged as the fastest wealth creator and Adani Enterprises the best all-round wealth creator.  Motilal Oswal found that the Top 100 companies in India’s equity markets created Rs 71 lakh crore in wealth during the five years from 2016 to 2021. This was the highest wealth created in the past 26 five-year periods. The pace of wealth creation was also robust at a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent vis-à-vis 14 percent for the BSE Sensex.  The previous best period in terms of wealth creation was 2014-19, when the markets generated Rs 49 lakh crore of wealth for investors. The five-year period of 2015-20 was impacted by the pandemic and created Rs 21 lakh crore of investor wealth.  The Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2021, was released on December 15. The firm’s wealth creation study was commissioned by Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman of Motilal Oswal Group.  Reliance rules the roost  Reliance Industries, the largest Indian company by market capitalisation, smashed all records to emerge as the largest wealth creator for the third time in a row. It added Rs 9.7 lakh crore to investor wealth, beating its own previous record of Rs 5.6 lakh crore during 2014-19. The company accounted for 13.6 percent of the total wealth created during the period.  “Reliance’s re-emergence as the biggest wealth creator reflects the power of phygital – physical plus digital,” Motilal Oswal said in the report. “Its oil-to-chemicals and retail businesses are strongly rooted in the physical whereas the telecom business is the digital dimension. Going forward, expect more and more phygital and digital companies to spearhead wealth creation.”  IT giant Tata Consulting Services came in second by creating wealth of Rs 7.3 lakh crore, followed by HDFC Bank, which added Rs 5.2 lakh crore, Hindustan Unilever Rs 3.4 lakh crore and Infosys Rs 3.3 lakh crore.  Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HCL Technologies made up the remaining top 10 wealth creators for 2016-21.  Reliance also made its entry into the list of top 10 fastest wealth creators, an area which is ruled predominantly by mid and small cap companies.  Adani Group – fastest in the race  The study found Adani Transmission was the fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 93 percent during 2016-21. Another Adani Group company – Adani Enterprises – was ranked the third fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 86 percent, behind Deepak Nitrite, which had a price CAGR of 90 percent.  Tanla Platforms and Ruchi Soya were the other two companies in the top five fastest wealth creators.  A sum of Rs 10 lakh invested equally in 2016 among the top 10 fastest wealth creators would have grown to Rs 170 lakh in 2021, which is a CAGR of 77 percent compared with 14 percent for the Sensex, according to the study.  “For high wealth creation, it is essential to pick small-to-mid companies with robust earnings growth prospects trading at reasonable valuations,” the study highlighted.  Adani Enterprises also emerged as the most consistent wealth creator in the past five years with the highest price CAGR of 86 percent.  Sectoral Participation  The financial sector emerged as the biggest wealth creating sector during 2016-21 by generating Rs 17.4 lakh crore. The sector lost its numero uno position last year to consumer &amp;amp; retail, which came in at third position this year with Rs 12.5 lakh crore. Technology occupied the second position by adding Rs 15.2 lakh crore.  Oil &amp;amp; gas and metals &amp;amp; mining made up the remaining list of top five biggest wealth creating sectors.  Led by rapid adoption of cloud, transformation and digitisation, the technology sector is witnessing robust demand and a strong deal pipeline, which will lead to high growth for the sector.  “It is the only sector which may potentially challenge the dominance of the financial sector in the next wealth creation study period, 2017-2022,” Motilal Oswal said.  PSUs lose the plot  Public sector undertakings (PSUs) came up with their worst performance in the wealth creation process in 2016-21. Only Gujarat Gas and Indraprastha Gas could make it to the top 100 wealth creators, generating less than 1 percent of the total wealth.  The previous period of 2015-20, there were seven PSUs in the top 100, with 3 percent of the total wealth created. The study also found out that there were five PSUs in the top 10 wealth destroying companies. Private banks were the top wealth creators while public sector banks made up the top wealth destroyers.  Digital – the way to go  The wealth creation report highlighted that digital will be the mantra of the future.  “Globally, value is migrating from atoms (businesses dealing in physical matter) to bits (businesses that are digital in nature),” the report said. “This has already played out in a big way in the US.”  The digital ecosystem in India is right for atoms-to-bits to play out here, it said.  According to the report, bits deal in intangible assets, have very low cost of replicating their products, and benefit from network effects.  “As a result, bits can scale up very rapidly compared to their atom counterparts,” the report added.  Bits have high initial losses and their success depends on hyper growth, operational scalability, large opportunity size, favourable unit economics, wide distribution and network effects.

RI,2021-10-23T13:51:49+05:30,Pallavi Pengonda,Reliance Q2 results satisfy as retail shines,Reliance Industries' September quarter results (Q2FY22) are broadly in line with analysts' estimates. The retail business saw strong recovery and performed well.,"Reliance Industries' (RIL) September quarter results (Q2FY22) are broadly in line with analysts' estimates, and have even outperformed on some parameters. The company’s consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased by 11 percent vis-à-vis the June quarter (Q1FY22) to Rs 26,020 crore. This represents a 37 percent year-on-year (YoY) EBITDA growth.  Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a report on October 22, “RIL's Q2 EBITDA was in line with Jefferies estimates (JEFe) on beat in Retail, in line O2C and miss in Jio.” O2C refers to RIL’s oil-to-chemical segments.  The broker further added, “EBITDA was up 11 percent quarter-on-quarter with Jio 1 percent below JEFe, Reliance Retail (RR) 6 percent ahead of JEFe and O2C in line with JEFe.”  With the restrictions easing after the second covid-19 wave, the retail business saw a strong recovery. RIL’s Q2 retail revenues have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Core retail revenue growth stood at 16 percent YoY. The business saw a meaningful improvement in store operating hours to 89 percent in September versus 38 percent in June.  Footfalls have recovered to 78 percent of pre-pandemic levels compared to 46 percent in Q1. The company saw strong growth in fashion &amp;amp; lifestyle with record quarterly sales in apparel &amp;amp; footwear category. New stores added in Q2 stood at 813, which is far higher than 123 stores added in Q1.  On the other hand, Reliance Jio’s performance was a tad underwhelming. The firm saw a churn of low-end subscribers owing to the pandemic’s impact, driving a net decline of 11.1 million in customer base in Q2. “A repeat of Jio's Q2 subscriber performance in Q3 will definitely dampen hopes of a tariff hike over the next few quarters.  For now, we will closely watch the JioPhone Next launch and its impact on Jio's net subscriber additions,” said Jefferies’ analysts in another report. To an extent, better ARPU (average revenue per user) compensated for the subscriber performance. In Q2, ARPU stood at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, representing a 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Centrum Broking Ltd analysts said in their first cut note, “Retail and Telecom now forms approx. 48 percent of consolidated EBITDA versus around 32/40 percent in FY20/21. With the continued reopening across the country from June driving a strong return to normalcy H2FY22 will see much stronger numbers from both these segments, in our opinion.”  Meanwhile, RIL’s O2C business performance was decent last quarter. Revenues grew 58 percent YoY mainly on account of better realizations driven by the increase in oil prices and higher volumes. O2C EBITDA increased by around 44 percent year-on-year and 4 percent sequentially.  Overall, RIL’s profit after tax (PAT) in Q2 increased by 46 percent YoY and 12 percent quarter-on-quarter. Centrum Broking’s analysts said, “RIL adjusted consolidated EBITDA/ PAT at Rs 26000 crore/ Rs 15500 crore, beat Centrum’s estimated EBITDA/ PAT of Rs24800 crore/ 14600 crore as retail revived strongly with higher margins (retail EBIT +66 percent quarter-on-quarter).”  Ahead of the results announcement on Friday, the RIL stock closed marginally higher at Rs 2,627.40 per share on the National Stock Exchange. Some analysts expect the growth outlook to be strong. JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd expects a strong free cash flow generation phase with major capex completed and strong 17-18 percent earnings per share CAGR likely over the next three-five years. CAGR is the compound annual growth rate.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

All businesses recorded growth over pre-Covid levels with the digital services segment having a record quarterly business in Q2.  Profit in the year-ago period was at Rs 10,602 crore and Rs 13,806 crore in June 2021 quarter. The sequential growth in profit was 12.1 percent.  Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at Rs 1.74 lakh crore, significantly higher by 49.8 percent compared to Rs 1.16 lakh crore reported in the year-ago period, said Reliance Industries in its BSE filing, adding the topline growth on a sequential basis was 20.6 percent.  &quot;Reliance has posted a strong performance in Q2FY22. This demonstrates the inherent strengths of our businesses and the robust recovery of the Indian and global economies. All businesses reflect growth over pre-Covid levels,&quot; said Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani in a statement.  He further said the operational and financial performance reflected a sharp recovery in the retail segment and sustained growth in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and digital services business.  &quot;O2C business benefited from sharp recovery in demand across products and higher transportation fuel margins. Reliance Retail continues to grow on the back of rapid expansion of both physical stores and digital offerings resulting in healthy growth in revenues and margin expansion,&quot; Ambani added.  He said Jio, the digital services business, continued to transform the broadband market in India and set new benchmarks for the industry.  The standalone profit of the company grew by 44.1 percent to Rs 9,228 crore and gross revenue increased by 68.8 percent to Rs 1.08 lakh crore YoY in Q2.  The operating performance was also strong during the quarter, with record consolidated EBITDA at Rs 30,283 crore for the quarter, growing 30 percent YoY.  Jio Platforms  The telecom business reported quarterly operating revenue at Rs 19,777 crore, a growth of 15.1 percent YoY (adjusted for interconnection usage charge or IUC), driven by continued subscriber traction in the connectivity business, with average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, which is a healthy 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Jio, which continued to hold the top position in 4G coverage and availability, had a customer base of 429.5 million at the end of September 2021, a net addition of 23.8 million customers YoY.  Its net profit grew by a massive 23.5 percent YoY to Rs 3,728 crore and EBITDA increased by 16.6 percent to Rs 9,294 crore in the quarter ended September 2021.  Retail Business  Reliance Retail delivered strong performance with revenue from operations growing 9.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 39,926 crore in September 2021 quarter which saw robust growth across all consumption baskets led by strong revival in consumer sentiments amid festivities, relaxations in Covid related curbs and vaccinations.  &quot;The business re-established growth momentum in fashion &amp;amp; lifestyle with sales closing above pre-Covid levels. Consumer electronics and grocery maintained strong growth momentum,&quot; the company said.  Retail business profit for the quarter at Rs 1,695 crore grew by 74.2 percent, with EBIDTA growth of 45.2 percent YoY at Rs 2,913 crore, driven by favourable revenue mix, and continued focus on cost management and investment income, said the company, adding EBITDA margin expanded by 180 bps YoY driven by strong operating leverage.  Oil-To-Chemicals Business  The O2C business sustained growth momentum, registering a 58.1 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.2 lakh crore primarily due to improved realisation on the back of increase in oil prices and higher volumes. Refinery throughput increased by 11.8 percent YoY to 17.1 MMT (million metric tonnes) during the quarter.  Crude prices were lifted higher by tighter supply amid multiple production outages, lowering in uptick of Covid infections and higher overall throughput. Brent crude averaged $73.5 a barrel in Q2FY22, up by $4.6 QoQ and $30.5 YoY).  Reliance said O2C business EBITDA improved by 43.9 percent YoY to Rs 12,720 crore primarily on account of better transportation fuel cracks, higher intermediates product deltas, efficient product placement and yield management. However, &quot;EBITDA margin for the quarter declined by 100bps YoY to 10.6 percent due to base effect driven by higher feedstock and product prices,&quot; it noted.  Solar Energy Business  Reliance Industries has increased its focus on solar energy segment as it is going to establish and enable up to 100 GW of solar energy in India by 2030, and become a global player in the renewable industry.  &quot;We continue to make steady progress in accelerating foray into new energy and new materials business. Our partnership approach and the desire to bring India to the forefront of global transition to clean and green transition is underscored by recent investments in some of the best companies in the world in the solar and green energy space,&quot; Ambani said.  &quot;I am now even more confident of achieving ambitious target of Net Carbon Zero by 2035,&quot; he added.  Recently its subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar (RNESL) acquired 86,887 series C preferred shares of Germany's NexWafe GmbH at a price of EUR 287.73 per share for 25 million euros. NexWafe is developing and producing monocrystalline silicon wafers.  Reliance New Energy Solar also decided to acquire 40 percent stake in Sterling &amp;amp; Wilson Solar, which executed 11-plus GW of solar turnkey projects globally, through a combination of primary investment, secondary purchase and open offer. Moreover, it acquired REC Solar Holdings AS, one of the world's leading solar cells / panels and polysilicon manufacturing company, from China National Bluestar (Group) Co Ltd, for an enterprise value of $771 million.

RI,2021-10-22T09:27:54+05:30,Moneycontrol News," RIL Q2 Result Preview: Double-digit growth likely in earnings parameters, driven by retail, digital...","The retail and digital businesses, which accounted for 32.4 percent and 18.5 percent of total revenue, respectively, could be the stars in the September quarter","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries is expected to clock double-digit growth in key earnings parameters for the September quarter on a year-on-year basis, driven by the retail and digital segments.  The Reliance stock price hit a record high of Rs 2,750 on the BSE on October 19, with a market capitalisation of almost Rs 18.3 lakh crore. The stock had a strong run-up recently after the company signed several deals in the solar energy business. It has gained 24 percent since the beginning of July.  The September quarter earnings, to be declared on October 22, will likely decide the direction of the stock price.  Experts said Reliance’s retail and digital businesses, which accounted for 32.4 percent and 18.5 percent of total revenue, respectively, could be the stars in the September quarter, driving double-digit growth in every earnings parameter.  “Retail and digital business will post a strong recovery,” Motilal Oswal said in its earnings preview. The brokerage, which has a ‘buy’ call on the stock, expects consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 24 percent YoY, driven by the retail and digital businesses, and revenue growth of 34 percent YoY.  Motilal Oswal expects the oil-to-chemical segment’s EBITDA to grow by 39 percent, Reliance Jio’s EBITDA to increase by 21 percent, and retail EBITDA to grow by 38 percent from a year earlier.  Yes Securities expects Reliance to report better earnings (QoQ and YoY) on improved retail profitability and refinery margins.  The benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) was at $3.7 a barrel, the highest in the past seven quarters, improving further QoQ in Q2 of FY22, led by better gasoline, aviation turbine fuel and naphtha cracks amid hurricane-led supply disruptions, said Motilal Oswal. GRM is a measure of the amount that refiners earn from turning each barrel of crude oil into fuel products.  Brent crude prices averaged $73 a barrel in Q2, a jump of about 70 percent YoY and 6 percent QoQ, due to supply-side disruptions and inventory shortages. This despite OPEC+ easing production cuts starting in August. Recent hurricanes in the US have taken out more than 25 million barrels of offshore production, said Motilal Oswal.  Brent prices have been increasing and crossed $86 a barrel on October 21 for the first time since October 2018. The rally in prices is largely because of expectations of strong global growth, power outages mainly in China, and supply concerns.  Kotak, too, expects strong earnings growth at Reliance for the quarter, with consolidated profit rising 38.3 percent, EBITDA up 35.1 percent and revenue increasing 32.1 percent YoY.

","Shareholders of Reliance Industries have approved the appointment of Saudi Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan on the company board, with less than 2 per cent of votes cast against the proposal.  Disclosing the results of shareholder votes on the appointment, Reliance in a regulatory filing said 98.03 per cent of votes were cast in favour of the resolution to appoint Al-Rumayyan for three years.  As many as 10.89 crore shares or 1.96 per cent voted against the resolution, while 3.23 crore votes were declared invalid due to lack of proper authorisation, it said.  The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), a shareholder of Reliance, had last month decided to vote against the move based on US proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis' recommendation.  CalSTRS decided to oppose the appointment due to Al-Rumayyan's position in Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as its governor, as well as in Aramco.  PIF has already invested Rs 9,555 crore in Reliance Retail and Rs 11,367 crore in RIL's Jio Platforms. Also, Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in Reliance's oil-to-chemical business.  Reliance had, however, rejected conflict of interest allegations saying, &quot;The appointment of Yasir Al Rumayyan has no connection with the contemplated transaction with Saudi Aramco&quot;.  The O2C business of RIL is being spun off to a subsidiary.  &quot;As per the terms of the proposed transaction, Saudi Aramco will participate in the equity of the O2C subsidiary. The O2C subsidiary board may have nominees of Saudi Aramco to protect its interest,&quot; it added.  As of June 30, 2020, CalSTRS held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of RIL, according to its website. CalSTRS is America's second-largest public pension fund with assets totalling approximately USD 318.4 billion as of August 31, 2021.  CalSTRS's opposition was based on a report by Glass, Lewis &amp;amp; Co, an American proxy advisory services company. According to Glass, Lewis &amp;amp; Co, since Al-Rumayyan has a key role in the operations of Aramco and PIF, he does not qualify to be an independent director.  Under Indian law, an independent director cannot have a role in any company that has a business or equity partnership with the firm that intends to appoint him or her.

RI,2021-09-21T17:41:58+05:30,PTI," RIL, Mahindra, Wipro among over 100 firms committed to reporting stakeholder capitalism metrics: World...","The 'stakeholder capitalism metrics' initiative of the WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, seeks to improve the ways that companies measure and demonstrate their performance against ESG (environmental, social and governance) indicators and to enable positive contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","More than 100 business houses globally, including Reliance Industries, Mahindra Group and Wipro from India, have committed to including Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in their annual or sustainability reports, the World Economic Forum said on Tuesday.  Of these, more than 50 have already begun including Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, an initiative of Geneva-based WEF, in their mainstream financial and regulatory reporting. These include PayPal, PwC, Petronas, S&amp;amp;P, Salesforce, Total and Yara International.  The 'stakeholder capitalism metrics' initiative of the WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, seeks to improve the ways that companies measure and demonstrate their performance against ESG (environmental, social and governance) indicators and to enable positive contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The project's twin objectives are to accelerate convergence among the leading private ESG standard-setters and to bring greater comparability and consistency to the reporting of ESG disclosures.  During its ongoing Sustainable Development Impact Summit, the WEF said that the international support is growing for the stakeholding capitalism metrics initiative with more than 50 companies having begun reporting these metrics in their 2020-2021 filings, while over 100 have shown support for this initiative so far.  The summit brings together global leaders from business, government, and civil society under the theme 'Shaping an Equitable, Inclusive and Sustainable Recovery'.  Those having committed to such reporting include Accenture, Allianz, Bank of America, Dell, Deloitte, EY, HEINEKEN, IBM, Mahindra Group, Mastercard, Nasdaq, Nestle, Reliance Industries, UBS, Unilever and Wipro.  Drawn from existing standards, the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics provide a set of metrics that can be reported on by all companies, regardless of industry or region, the WEF said.  The metrics also offer comparability, which is particularly important for informing ongoing efforts to create a systemic, globally accepted set of common standards for reporting on sustainability performance.  &quot;We are delighted to see so many companies joining this effort and, even more so, excited to see many already implementing the metrics into their reporting,&quot; WEF Managing Director Olivier Schwab said.  &quot;This is the first time we have publicly seen this breadth of data from global companies across sectors on ESG factors. The Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are already demonstrating that consistent and comparable ESG reporting can help articulate to stakeholders the collective contribution of ESG commitments,&quot; Schwab added.  An early analysis of reports already incorporating the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in mainstream reporting demonstrates that it is now easier to consistently measure individual company progress against critical ESG areas, as well as the collective impact of those companies committed to reporting the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.  An initial analysis of the first 45 reports from companies shows how companies are building skills for the future, with over USD 1.5 trillion invested in training.  They also indicate that companies are innovating for better products and services, with over USD 20 trillion spent on R&amp;amp;D and USD 23 trillion in cumulative multi-year innovation investments. They are also contributing to their communities and social vitality with nearly USD 140 trillion in taxes.  The WEF said companies have also faced some challenges reporting on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. These include data accessibility, jurisdictional challenges and data-processing capabilities.  Despite these challenges, corporate support for ESG reporting and the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative continues to grow and the Forum will continue to invite all of its partners to join this initiative, it added.

The government, using rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations, fixes the price of natural gas produced by firms such as state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) from fields given to them on nomination basis, every six months. The next review is due on October 1.  The price, referred to as APM or administered rate, will rise to $3.15 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for the period from October 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022 from the current $1.79, the brokerage said.  The rate for gas from deepwater fields such as KG-D6 of Reliance Industries Ltd and BP Plc would rise to USD 7.4 per mmBtu next month.  Natural gas is the raw material that is converted into compressed natural gas (CNG) for use in automobiles as fuel or piped to household kitchens for cooking purposes.  &quot;The expected surge in APM gas prices would present a challenge to city gas distribution (CGD) players as it would mean a rise in their gas cost for CNG and residential piped natural gas,&quot; it said. &quot;APM gas price rise would mean hefty price hikes would have to be made by IGL (that retails CNG in national capital and adjoining cities) and MGL (which retail CNG in Mumbai) in the next one year.&quot;  The city gas distributors (CGD) &quot;would have to make price hikes of 10-11 percent in October,&quot; ICICI Securities said in a report.  Going by the trend in international markets, the APM gas price is likely to rise to $5.93 per mmBtu in April 2022 to September 2022 and to $7.65 during October 2022 to March 2023.  This would mean another 22-23 percent hike in CNG and piped natural gas prices in April 2022 and 11-12 percent in October 2022, it said.  &quot;Rise in APM gas price from $1.79 per mmBtu in H1FY22 to $7.65 per mmBtu in H2FY23E would mean MGL and IGL would have to make price hikes of 49-53 percent during October 2021 to October 2022,&quot; it said. &quot;CGD players may be able to make the required hefty price hikes given sharply higher prices of competing fuels, petrol and diesel.

International Climate Summit 2021: Here is the full text  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi,  Hon’ble Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri. Bhupender Yadav ji,  Hon’ble Minister of Power and New &amp;amp; Renewable Energy Shri Raj Kumar Singh ji, Hon’ble Minister of Science and Technology Shri Jitendra Singh ji,  Member Energy NITI Aayog Dr. V K Saraswat,  Former Executive Director International Energy Agency, Mr. Nobuo Tanaka Chairman Greenstat India, Mr. Sturle Pedersen Other distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning to all of you.  It is my privilege to deliver the inaugural address at the International Climate Summit - 2021 before this august audience.  I am delighted to see that this conference is bringing together leading policymakers, industrialists, investors, and scientists to discuss climate change and clean energy.  This Summit is taking place against the backdrop of a historic announcement by our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on August 15.  In his address to the nation on the 75th Independence Day, he launched the Green Hydrogen Mission for India.  The fact that he chose “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” to make this announcement has sent a powerful message to both Indians and the rest of the world.  In my view, the message is two-fold:  One, India is determined to achieve azadi from dependence on fossil energy and become atma-nirbhar in New and Renewal Energy.  Two, India will make its fullest contribution to the global effort for achieving the goals and targets of Climate Action.  Dear Friends,  Climate Change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today. The world is witnessing with alarming frequency the disastrous effects of global warming. Glaciers are retreating. Mean sea level is rising.  Extreme and unpredictable weather changes are becoming regular. Ecological damage is becoming stark. Indeed, Climate Change, if uncontrolled, can threaten the very existence of life on our planet. Therefore, it is not enough to make our economies carbon neutral. The world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  We have only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. Because Climate Change is a global problem, the clean energy transition calls for the widest possible global cooperation in technology development, investments and fair market access.  Ladies and gentlemen,   While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India for another reason. Most of our present energy demand is met by imported fossil fuels costing us 160 billion USD every year.  Although India’s per capita energy consumption and emissions are less than half the global average, we are the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  India’s energy needs will increase exponentially as our economic growth accelerates to fulfil the aspirations of 1.38 billion people. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  Both India and the world are thus facing an unprecedented challenge. However, every challenge in human history has come with an opportunity to move to the next level of progress.  Dear Friends,  I am convinced that Climate Change is an opportunity for human civilisation to renew itself in the 21st century… An opportunity to create a healthier, happier, more secure and more resilient future for the human race…  A future in which there will be greater harmony between Man and Mother Nature. This opportunity for civilizational renewal will be realised by New and Renewable Energy. If Old Energy created the problem of Climate Change, New Energy will provide a reliable solution to Climate Mitigation.  As a matter of fact, a New GREEN REVOLUTION has already begun in India. The Old Green Revolution made India self-reliant in food production. The New Green Revolution will help make India self-sufficient in energy production.  It is a matter of great pride for all of us that India has now achieved a major milestone of 100 gigawatts installed renewable energy. India is today among the top three most attractive destinations for Renewable Energy.  The target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by December 2022 is now well within sight.  The entire world will applaud India’s singular achievement under the leadership of our Honourable Prime Minister.  Dear Friends,  I take this opportunity to share with you my perspectives on how India can become a global leader in Green Energy Revolution in the years to come. The Indian subcontinent is truly blessed by Soorya Deva, Vayu Deva and other gods with abundant renewable energy resources.  Taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5% of our land.  Solar is perfectly suited to decentralised energy production, which in turn can promote decentralised socio-economic development. By investing in smart, two-way grids, micro-grids, efficient storage solutions and smart meters, we can enable individuals, communities and neighbourhoods to become both consumers and producers of energy.  These installations can be located close to demand. They have low maintenance requirements.  Importantly, they have little environmental impact and entail zero human displacement problems. The rapid fall in the cost of production has made solar energy highly competitive, attracting large-scale investments.  This shall play a key role in ensuring similar growth trends in “Green Hydrogen” – the future replacement of fossil fuels. Green Hydrogen is a zero-carbon energy. It is the best and cleanest source of energy, which can play a fundamental role in the world’s decarbonisation plans. Green hydrogen is key to our ever green, sustainable and prosperous future of everyone on the planet  Hydrogen has high gravimetric energy density and can be reconverted into electricity and heat with zero emissions. Although the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis today are high, they are expected to fall significantly in the coming years.  New technologies are emerging for hydrogen storage and transportation, which will dramatically reduce the cost of distribution. Furthermore, the Government of India is planning to create an enabling Green Hydrogen eco-system in the country. Because of all these developments, Green Hydrogen will surely attract significant investments.  Dear Friends,  Reliance Industries is fully committed to realising the vision of our Hon’ble Prime Minister to fuel India’s Green Economy using clean energy. Last year I had announced our ambitious commitment to make Reliance a net carbon zero company by 2035.  This year, I presented our strategy and roadmap for the New Energy Business, which will be the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. This complex will have four Giga Factories, which cover the entire spectrum of renewable energy. The first will be an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. The second will be an advanced energy storage battery factory.  The third will be an electrolyser factory for the production of Green Hydrogen.  The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. Over the next three years we will invest 75,000 crore rupees in these initiatives.  Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to India and Indians.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has set the goal to reach 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Out of this, Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030.  This will create a pan-India network of kilowatt and megawatt scale solar energy producers who can produce Green Hydrogen for local consumption.  This will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India. Efforts are on globally to make Green Hydrogen most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under USD 2 per kg.  Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade.  And India has always set and achieved even more audacious goals.   Am sure that India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under USD 1 per kg within a decade. This will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade – the 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen.  India has achieved several goals that seemed impossible over the years. I am sure this 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen will also be achieved by our talented young entrepreneurs, researchers and innovators.  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,  You are the architect of a New India. Your vision of New India is propelled by New and Renewable Energy. It will create millions of new and high-value green jobs for our youth. It will give a big boost to green enterprises in India, who can proudly proclaim: “Made in India, by India, for India and for the world!”.  It will transform India from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Energy solutions. It will also bridge the green energy divide in India and globally. I am certain that, under your dynamic leadership, India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a People’s Movement.  On behalf of all my colleagues in the Indian industry, on behalf of Reliance and on my own behalf, I pledge full support and commitment to your vision and mission.  Thank you.   Disclaimer:  Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Kotak Mahindra Bank has also been the top all-round wealth creator, the brokerage firm said.  The Annual Wealth Creation Study further revealed that Tasty Bite Eatables has been the fastest wealth creator In the last 5 years while Reliance Industries has been the biggest and Pidilite has been the most consistent in the same period.  Besides, Ajanta Pharma, Alembic Pharma, Astral Poly Tech, AU Small Finance and Bajaj Finance are among the 'potential 25 wealth creators for the next 25 years', said the brokerage firm.    The brokerage firm on December 22 announced the Motilal Oswal 25th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2020.  For the last 25 years, the firm has been releasing a wealth creation study every year. Raamdeo Agrawal, Chairman of Motilal Oswal Group, commissions the study every year.  In this year's study, the brokerage firm attempted to shortlist 25 stocks likely to deliver handsome returns over the next 25 years.  As per the brokerage firm, it made a list of 150 mid-cap companies i.e. companies that are ranked 101 to 250 by current market cap.  It preferred consumer-facing, secular business models and eliminated cyclical businesses like auto ancillaries, capital goods, chemicals, oil &amp;amp; gas and realty which reduced the list of companies from 150 to 114.  To ensure the chosen firms are very profitable, the brokerage firm said it picked companies with last 5-year average RoE greater than 15 percent. This reduced the list from 114 to 63.  Next, it judged the business potential and management potential of the companies, and selected only those which qualified on both counts. This reduced the list from 63 to 28.  After that, the brokerage firm flagged off market leaders from the 28 companies to arrive at a list of 13 companies. Apart from these 13 companies, the brokerage chose 5 such companies from the list of 28 that are beneficiaries of value migration. In situations of value migration, all companies benefit irrespective of market leadership.  Now, the total shortlisted stocks were 18.  The brokerage firm said it chose only large-caps for financials and picked 6 leader names for the portfolio, now taking the total to 24.  At last, it opted for a pure digital play, even if it didn’t meet some of the above filters, taking the total to 25.  &quot;We believe in the very long run, valuations matter less. So we ignored the same in the shortlisting process,&quot; said Motilal Oswal.

Together, we now have become a value creation platform for our customers and small businesses,&quot; Ambani said.  In April 2020, Facebook, purchased a 9.9 percent stake in RIL's telecom unit Jio for $5.7 billion (Rs 43,574 crore).

A big part of why I was excited to partner with you is, there are not many people around the world who've just gone industry after industry and revolutionized them and improved them, and continue to do it, and have that hunger to improve the lives of so many people,&quot; Zuckerberg said on December 15.

The conversation on Day 1 of the two-day Facebook-hosted event revolved around opportunities in India, the way digital can accelerate economic progress, and how small businesses will be a key part of the global recovery going forward.  Read the full transcript of the conversation between Mukesh Ambani and Mark Zuckerberg below:   Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I am sorry that we can't do this together in person, but we're excited to host the first-ever Facebook Fuel event in India. India is a very special and important country for us. Millions of people here use our products every day to stay in touch with friends and family. Whether it's a WhatsApp message, or a Facebook post, or photos on Instagram. And millions of small businesses across the country use WhatsApp business and Messenger to reach customers, manage orders, and grow their businesses. And in fact, we actually test some of our new features here first, before rolling them out globally. And speaking of tests, we just announced that we are hosting India’s tour of Australia on demand on Facebook Watch. I am not exactly a sports guy myself, but I understand that that's quite a big deal here. And what I do know is that India is home to a lot of incredibly talented people. Now we see that in the folks that we recruit in our offices, both in India and at our headquarters, back in California. But this is more than just about Facebook because what happens in India here is important for the whole world as well. Prime Minister Modi's Digital India Vision, has opened up opportunities for the industry to partner with the government to accelerate growth and development through technology. And India is building local capabilities and tech capacity, to power innovative new business models and provide Indian citizens access to digital and financial inclusion. So, decisions that are made here, shape the global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people. And a lot of Indian organizations are leading the way, and using technology to build safer communities and more inclusive financial systems. Whether it's in social commerce, or education or financial services, there is a lot of innovation that happens here, and we are proud to partner with some of the teams that are working on these important challenges. There's a very entrepreneurial culture here, that's quite remarkable. It's a great example of how access to better tools can unlock more opportunity for people, and we see that not just in the tech start-up scene, but millions and millions of small businesses that recognize the value that all these tools can provide. So, at Facebook, we like to say that we are in the business of serving small businesses. And nowhere is this more true than in India. This is especially important because small businesses here will be a key part of the global recovery going forward. And we are focused on making sure we build the best tools for them. So, this is part of a much broader conversation about how we can all make sure that tech delivers for everyone. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to partner with Jio, which has played such a key role in giving hundreds of millions of Indians access to the benefits of the internet, everything that it can provide, and fostering this entrepreneurial culture. And with that, I am really glad to welcome Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, to talk about where things stand in terms of the country's digital transformation, and what we should expect in the years ahead. Mukesh, thank you very much for being here and let's get started.  Mukesh Ambani: Mark, first of all, congratulations to you and your team for organizing this Facebook Fuel for India event. I am sure this event will provide a lot of fuel of ideas to fire India’s growth engine as you just described. The most powerful idea that can propel India’s growth is that young people can create great enterprises and new businesses. And all the young Indian people see an inspiring young icon in Mark Zuckerberg. They are motivated when they see how in just 14 years, Facebook has become the face of a digitally connected India. So, let me begin by conveying my best wishes to the success of your dreams for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, I appreciate that. You know, so maybe today we should start with a topic that I know is top of mind for a lot of us, that is COVID-19 and the impact that it has had on all of our lives and communities. So, I am curious from your perspective, how is India doing right now? And when do you expect things are going to return to normal? And I know that Reliance has taken a number of big steps to help the community and help the country, and it's been a big year for you. So I am curious to hear, how did your company adapt to help move forward in the midst of this pandemic?  Mukesh Ambani: The sheer magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic, like everybody else in the world, did startle all of us in India. But then I think it is not in India’s DNA to be deterred by a crisis. I firmly believe that a crisis is too precious to be wasted. Every crisis presents an opportunity for new growth, and India has faced the COVID crisis with enormous resilience and resolve. Prime Minister Modi has led India from the front, and while we are not as rich a country as some of our western counterparts, being fiscally prudent, he has taken steps to take care of our vulnerable. We have given free food for right up to December of this year, to over 800 million Indians. 200 million citizens in India are getting direct cash transfer of Rs. 1500 in their bank account - that is the digitally connected India. And now we are ready and pretty much at par with the world, to roll out one of the largest vaccine programs in the first half of 2021, under Prime Minister's leadership. We at Reliance and Reliance Foundation, have also taken steps. As you know, Reliance has over 350,000 employees across the length and breadth of India and we have taken steps to protect over 2 million in our family and the community around them. In Mumbai, we have built a hospital just dedicated to COVID-19. We have Life Sciences as part of our business, so we have tested up early on - we have really ramped up testing, and we believe that testing helped in tracing and isolation, and at least reduced fatalities in our communities to a very low level. We have produced PPEs. We are in the textile business in Reliance, and India did not have…we used to import all our protective gear from the external world. In a matter of months, we at Reliance, produced a hundred thousand PPE's, and we are now exporters from India and this happened during the COVID time. And most importantly in the early days, when we were little stuck, we at the Reliance Foundation, distributed 55 million, one of the largest meal distribution programs for the vulnerable, in all the states and villages. So, we have played our part. And as far as Jio is concerned, we had our own dedicated team. And I could tell you that, we had never imagined that we would all work from home and the network traffic grew multiple percentage and none of us stepped out. But we could maintain 99% availability, so that Indians could work from home, shop from home, study from home, and remain connected to the rest of the world. You know, Mark, sometimes I wonder that if the pandemic had struck India just four or five years earlier, we would not have been in as good a shape as what we are today, with all the connectivity we have. The credit for that must go to our Prime Minister's Digital India vision, where he motivated the entire industry to roll out broadband in the first five years of his first term. And during the pandemic, India has attracted the largest foreign direct investment in its history. Mark, we have our own example of how Jio and Facebook concluded our partnership right in the middle of lockdown. And let me tell you with utmost sincerity, that we at Reliance and Jio, immensely value our partnership with Facebook. Thank you for your faith in Jio. Thank you, Mark, for your faith in India. I have no hesitation in going on record, that it is your investment that set the ball rolling. Not only for Jio but for the Indian FDI which has been the largest-ever in its history. And our partnership between Jio and Facebook will actually demonstrate that it is great for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses. And I believe Mark, that our actions will speak louder than our words in the coming months and years.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you. So, you know, one of the big opportunities that I see with this Facebook and Jio partnership is the role that we can play together in supporting the millions of small businesses in India, especially now with the impact that COVID is having, in accelerating the move of businesses from physical storefronts to digital ones in this digital future. So, I am curious what role do you see technology playing in this post-COVID world, especially as it relates to all of these small businesses. I know you share a passion with me that it is just critical that we serve them.  Mukesh Ambani: Absolutely, Mark. And let me point out a very unique feature about our partnership. Perhaps not many people have understood this. Because, before this partnership I believe that each one of us was mainly a communication platform. Together, we now have become a value creation platform for our customers and small businesses. And I firmly believe that technology, all the digitisation steps that India has taken will democratise wealth and value creation for individuals and small businesses. And let me explain this very simply. WhatsApp has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio Mart, which is our retail service, has the aspiration of serving tens of millions of small shopkeepers in India, who are the bedrock of employment. So what does this mean? This means Jio brings digital connectivity, WhatsApp now with WhatsApp Pay brings digital interactivity, and the ability to move to close transactions and create value and Jio Mart brings the unmatched online and offline retail opportunity, that gives our small shops which exist in villages and small towns in India, a chance to digitize and be at par with anybody else in the world. To my mind, more wealth creation means more employment and more business. And together with our platforms and the tools that we will provide to small businesses and to individual consumers, I believe will drive India to a 5 trillion economy and will make a much more equal India, with more equal wealth growth at the bottom of the pyramid. You know, Mark, I firmly believe that in the next two decades, India will grow to be among the top three economies in the world. But more importantly, it will become a premier digital society. It will be a modern society with young people driving it, with young businesses driving it. And our per capita income will go from eighteen hundred - two thousand dollars per capita, to five thousand dollars per capita. Our mid-income or the middle class in India which is about 50% of its total number of households, will grow to three to four percent per year. And I think that Facebook, Jio, and a lot of other companies and entrepreneurs in the world, have a golden opportunity to be in India, to be part of this economic and social transformation, that we are witnessing and that will accelerate in the coming decades.  Mark Zuckerberg: I completely agree, and your company has already done so much to help fuel this. Reliance brought about the 4G revolution in India, and I know that 5G now is another big focus for you. But what your company has done here I think, has been truly remarkable in helping to bring hundreds of millions of people onto the internet and bringing opportunity. And I’m curious, as you look ahead to the future in India, what other technologies or developments are you excited about now? And where do you see the country in the next five to ten years?  Mukesh Ambani: Well, as I mentioned to you Mark, I really see India accelerating as a premier digital society. I see us integrating both 5G…and just yesterday, our Prime Minister has said that, he wants every village and every gram panchayat…India has 680,000 villages, and we have a population of 1.3 billion people, and he wants everybody to be empowered on the information highway with high speed fix broadband, and which is happening. We also think that compute and very low latency compute is real. I think that there is a great opportunity for really bringing education and health care. With the second-generation reforms that were done in the last six months, we have unique opportunities and as Jio we are connecting all the 1.9 million schools in India and the 58 000 colleges. At any point in time, we will have in the coming decades, about 200 million children or young adults, between the age of 3 and 18 in our education system. I think that in a span of 10 years, we can set for ourselves an objective really to reskill India and the talent that you talked about, can improve 10x. Today, you're just seeing the creamy layer, but that's what technology can do to really make a better India and a better world. The same thing we can do in health and all the emerging technology and integrations, where we can make sure that we deliver services, and we deliver good proactive health. We've learned that and I think we're going to use technology. We are working very closely with all the authorities to make sure that we provide the technology tools and backbone for even vaccination in the coming quarters using technology. So, I think health, education….we've already… and I think that what India has done is in a sense, we have democratized value creation with the drive of our Prime Minister. And you can see it in payments, you will see it in terms of making sure that technology is easily available and we made it affordable, so that millions of millions of people, even at this lower per capita basis can use this in a large market. And with that finally, I really see the enterprise and the enthusiasm of young Indians, their aspirations, and their confidence that is really driving India. And that is why I think that the next two decades are going to be historic in terms of the social and economic transformation.  Mark Zuckerberg: That makes sense. You, of course, already talked about commerce and driving small businesses and entrepreneurship. It always blows me away that India has more than 60 million small businesses, and millions of people around the country rely on them for jobs and that's a big part of what I hope that our partnership can serve here. We support more than 50 million WhatsApp business app users globally every month already. And more than 15 million of these are in India. So you know with communities around the world now in lockdown there are a lot of these entrepreneurs who need digital tools that they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses. And now this is just something that I think that our partnership can really help with. And of course, beyond the impact on small businesses.I just think that this year has reminded us of how essential technology can be as a tool for people, to just connect with each other. Whether it's using the networks that your companies have established, or the tools that we've built to be able to have that human connection, and find important information. And as you said, I can't imagine going through the pandemic 10 years ago, two decades, when the internet was still nascent. It should have been a completely different experience. And technology, of course, is allowing us to make sure we can get accurate information out to people that has implications in health, like you're talking about, in education and helping serve people better. And I think it shows a lot of the promise for what's ahead and I think we've certainly fared better now, than we would have if the pandemic had hit us before.  Mukesh Ambani: I couldn't agree more, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: You know, going back to Reliance, one of the great business stories in history, your father founded Reliance Industries and he has this incredible legacy here in India. And now I’ve read that, he once held up a postcard in his office and said, if every Indian could speak with each other at the cost of this postcard, where will India be? And now your father clearly had a vision for where things were heading in the country, and because today Indians can communicate with one another for less than the cost of a postcard, and that's what we've tried to do with messaging…and hopefully we can do that together with payments and make it so people can use India's new UPI system, which I think is just great. It's a tremendous public good that the government has put out there. But I am curious, before we get into UPI and more on that, what's the most important thing that you learned from your father and his legacy, that has helped you build these amazing businesses and get to where they are today?  Mukesh Ambani: So Mark, thank you for those kind words on my father. Just so that when he motivated us in 2000, in terms of saying, can you make voice at the cost of a postcard? In 2020, we're very proud that Jio has pioneered free voice. So, all the 400 million people are a tribute to his vision. They are on our network and have a free voice. And as you said, my father was a son of a school teacher. He came to Mumbai with just a thousand rupees in 1960 and established Reliance with a belief that I will invest in businesses of the future, and I will invest in talent. And, for all the young people at Reliance and across India, I repeat my learnings in terms of building Reliance, three basic tenets really. One is, for entrepreneurs, it's important to have courage and self-belief. There can be no better person to demonstrate that in the last couple of decades than you, Mark. So you know, all of us believe that we have to believe in ourselves. And all of us know as entrepreneurs that we don't succeed at the first attempt, and self-belief comes to you when you fail. And self-belief increases your confidence when you succeed. So, courage and self-belief is something that I always tell entrepreneurs, remember that it's important. The second piece that he started and he's instilled into all of us is that, while you succeed, it's important to always have empathy and creativity in everything that you do. And by empathy, I mean, put yourself in the other's shoe, and make sure that how you make them feel is how you would want to feel. At Reliance, we do that at many levels now - we care for our employees, our investors, society, environment, and above all national interests of India. You know, within creativity….and I always give this example in terms of saying that, when Reliance needed to grow, capital markets were not there. It was the 1980s, and my father came up by saying, I will actually share shares of Reliance, which was never done in the private sector. In the 80s, the first AGM of Reliance was in a football ground, and we had 60,000 shareholders. You and I both do annual general meetings. And his AGM in the 1980s for Reliance was in a football ground and he said, my purpose is really to win investor’s confidence. Since then, creativity and empathy are critical as you go along. And the final thing that I have learned from my father, is really the importance of relationship, trust, and loyalty. The whole of Reliance right now, with hundreds of thousands of people, is one big family. We're not related by birth, but we are really woven together by passion, purpose, and conviction. We have faith in one another. We are loyal to one another, to this large Reliance family. For us, it's always one for all, and all for one. And I hope that a lot of people around the world can relate to this. That's what we believe at Reliance and for all of us at Reliance, he will still be the founder, if we follow his vision in terms of investing in businesses of the future. Mark, now that brings me to questions for you. Mark, what made you believe in India and the Jio story? As I said, you started this FDI avalanche in India, and the world recognized when Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, in the middle of lockdown said, I am going to bet on India and I’m going to make even in this uncertain times, one of the largest foreign direct investments in India. What do you think of the digital network that you are clearly….I call you the architect of the digital network of the world. While I have built some connectivity and broadband connectivity in India, you've done that for the world. Please share with us your experience as the digital architect of the world, how your global Facebook has helped people in this crisis, and your perspective of the crisis, and where you see the world today, and where it is going after you just explain to us what you’ve done in India?  Mark Zuckerberg: Your words are incredibly generous. And we started this to help give people a tool to stay connected with their friends, and then expand to friends and family and communities, and a lot of this just ends up being a universal human phenomenon. No matter what country you're in, you know everyone cares about their friends and family, and their communities, and wants to stay connected. And what we've seen is that, India is actually home to the largest communities in the world, across Facebook and WhatsApp and getting there on Instagram, as well. So, we see the vitality and the entrepreneurship, and the creativity of businesses, and how much people want to connect, and you see a tremendous number of people coming online, a lot of that…thanks to your investments, and the work that you've done to enable hundreds of millions of people to come online here. And I just see a very promising future in India. We talked briefly about how there's a big trend of financial inclusion ahead, and how the ease of payments is going to be such a big deal for commerce, and giving people self-reliance and control of their own destiny, and a lot of that. We just launched WhatsApp payments in India last month - now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp, as easily as sending a message. That was possible because of the UPI system that has been built in India. Unified Payments Interface, makes it easy for anyone to instantly accept payments across different apps. I think we're working with 140 banks or it's supported by 140 banks. India is the first country in the world to do anything like this. So, we're grateful to be able to support this kind of innovation and to help to work, to create more prosperity, and help achieve a more Digital India. And frankly, I think that a lot of other places around the world are going to be better off when they follow some of this lead that India has set, in creating public goods like this. So there's really a tremendous amount to be inspired by, with what is going on in India now. And we're just grateful to be able to serve our community here, and help people stay connected with the people they care about but also, create economic opportunity as well.  Mukesh Ambani: Thanks Mark, as you said, we are looking forward to your involvement and innovation in India, creating benefit for hundreds of millions of people and then taking this innovation to the rest of the world. I hope that the rest of the world learns from Indian policy, and what Facebook is able to achieve in India. And we as Indians will be very proud, if Facebook says we did it first in India, and then took it to 100 countries. And I look forward to working with you on that. Mark, all of us would love to know your views on how the world is changing, and what you and Facebook are thinking about it, and what you see the future as. Just give us your perspective, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: I think that there are a number of very important trends, but maybe I'll just talk about two. So, one is that, I think technology is giving individuals’ power and opportunities that were previously only held by large organizations. So, we've spent a lot of time today talking about small businesses, but one of the things that I think is so powerful about the internet is it makes it so that individual entrepreneurs and small businesses can now have access to the same kind of tools for reaching new customers and doing sophisticated analytics and communication that previously only bigger companies would have been able to build up the capacity to do that. And individuals can now share their ideas online, and get access to information in ways that previously only wealthier people or larger organizations would have had the capacity to share their ideas, or get access to information at that kind of scale. And overall, I think that just makes people's lives better. It's incredibly empowering and it's incredibly democratizing. India being the world's largest democracy, I think it really makes sense to lead there, because just empowering individuals, which I know is something that you believe deeply in as well, is just going to be a huge part of what will hopefully create a lot of prosperity, as you mentioned in the decades ahead. The other thing that I’m excited about is more of a technological vision for the future. There are a lot of interesting technologies, but one trend that I focus a lot on is that as people we're always looking to connect with other people and share our experiences in the richest way that we can. So, if you look back to the beginning of the internet, most of the internet was text. We would text each other, chat, share our experiences but then connections got better. And then we got to photos being the primary way that we shared. And you know the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words. Now, a lot of sharing is through photos and we're now on the next step with 4G and coming 5G networks - video is really becoming the primary way that people share. Anyone can largely capture something on their phones and can share it or stream it, and increasingly, people are able to consume that. And video is just a lot richer of a medium than photos even can be. When my daughters took her first steps, I wanted to capture a video of that and share it, not just a photo. But I don't think video is the end of the line. So, a lot of what I am focused on is helping to create virtual reality and augmented reality. So that way we can share not only a video of an experience, but you can use virtual reality to go into an experience and feel like you're right there. You can have holograms of digital objects that can kind of be as realistic as the physical objects that are there. Maybe you know, in five or ten years, when we're having this conversation, just a hologram version of me will be sitting on the couch next to you, instead of having to do this over a screen. And it'll feel a lot more realistic. So, I just think that's going to be incredibly powerful. And the power of virtual and augmented reality is they deliver the sense of a presence. You feel like you're right there with another person, which really will be the ultimate in human connection, and it will give people the opportunity to work and to connect, no matter where they want to be. So that's something that we're very focused on and invested in. And I’m just very excited for the future. And on that note, let me just wrap up and just say again how grateful I am for everything that you and your companies do, and for the partnership. I do think that in so many ways, not just Jio and the technology platforms, but the other businesses that you've built, you've had such a positive impact on improving the quality of lives for hundreds of millions of Indians. A big part of why I was excited to partner with you is, there are not many people around the world who've just gone industry after industry and revolutionized them and improved them, and continue to do it, and have that hunger to improve the lives of so many people. So, I just have a deep admiration for that. And I am really looking forward to working together over the coming years and decades to make sure we can serve the people in India as well as possible. And hopefully, a lot of those advances will be expanded outside of India as well, to help people around the world. But I am incredibly grateful for your partnership on this. Thank you for joining me for this inaugural Facebook Fuel event today.  Mukesh Ambani: Thank you very much, Mark. And thank you for sharing your awesome vision of the future. You started this with saying that on Facebook, you would see the India - Australia cricket match, I look forward to a day when Facebook will take me with everything that you explained on virtual reality, where I will be sitting in Mumbai and be in a stadium in Australia. And I’m sure that day, with your digital architecture and leadership, is not far away. Thank you so very much for having me.

We will continue to grow this segment with time,&quot; Akhilesh Prasad said.  Reliance Retail's other brand 'Swadesh' has an MoU with the Ministry of Textiles which enables the sourcing of 100 percent authentically crafted products, directly from artisan communities.

Here's what he said,"Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani on November 21 spoke at the 8th Convocation of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU).  Here's what Ambani said during the virtual address:  Honourable Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupaniji, my fellow members of the Board, faculty, teachers, staff, students, parents, and my dear friends,  A very warm good morning to each and every one of you. I wish all of you good health and safety. I hope that you are all taking necessary precautions to keep yourself and your dear ones safe and protected.  India has entered a crucial phase in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot afford to let our guards down at this juncture.  We are extremely privileged to have the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Sh Narendrabhai Modi, as the chief guest for today’s event. His passionate and dynamic leadership has made the world sit up and take notice of the emergence of a New India.  His confidence and conviction have inspired and galvanised the entire nation.  I am sure that the bold reforms introduced under his leadership will pave the way for India’s swift recovery and rapid economic progress in the years to come.  Friends, all of us know that PDPU itself is a product of Honourable Prime Minister Narendrabhai's &quot;Atmanirbhar&quot; vision.  It is a vision he cherished even when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat...to make India self-reliant in the areas of Energy, Energy Education, Research and Innovation.  PDPU is only fourteen years old. Yet, it already ranks among the Top-25 in the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements.  In terms of diversity, we attract international students from across the world. We have 284 international students from 39 countries.  And from a total of 132 students in the first convocation in 2009, we have 2,608 students, including 46 PhDs, graduating today.  From National Rankings, I am sure PDPU will soon earn a place in global rankings.  My dear teachers, PDPU has world-class physical infrastructure. But what gives me far greater joy is that PDPU has world-class faculty as well. Your dedication and commitment to excellence has been exemplary.  In the best practice of India's Guru Parampara, you have always gone beyond the call of duty. You have been friends, guides and mentors to your students. Let's take a moment to appreciate the leadership, faculty and all the staff of PDPU.  Friends, today I have a special reason to applaud PDPU. The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow on the academic lives and careers of students across the world.  Precious hours of academic engagement, debate and research have been lost in lockdowns. Yet, our very own PDPU did exceptionally well even in these challenging times.  The flame of teaching and learning at PDPU shone brightest even during the darkest days of the pandemic. Our faculty continued to present award-winning research papers in national and international conferences. Our students continued to enjoy co-curricular and extra-curricular activities held digitally.  These facts make me proud of our university. But my heart swelled with greater pride when I learnt that PDPU also contributed to the nation's fight against COVID-19. Our teachers and students designed several medical equipment, including an ICU ventilator.  I salute the leadership of PDPU for combining Jnana with Seva. This combination is the greatest badge of honour for any educational institution.  Dear members of the PDPU Community, our accomplishments so far have been a source of joy.  However, we have to prepare ourselves to scale still higher summits of success.  The future of energy is being shaped by unprecedented changes. And these changes are impacting the future of humanity — indeed, the very future of our planet.  The most important question we face is this:  Can we produce the growing amounts of energy we need to sustain our economies without harming the environment?...Without failing to fulfil our climate change obligations? We must be prepared to answer this question with a CONFIDENT &quot;YES&quot;!  By the middle of this century, the world will use twice as much energy as we use today. In the next two decades, India’s own per-capita energy needs will be more than twice as much as today.  Therefore, India is required to simultaneously pursue two goals: To become an economic superpower. To become a green and clean energy superpower.  To achieve these twin goals, we need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies. We need breakthroughs in new energy sources such as green and blue hydrogen. We also need great innovations in energy storage, saving and utilisation.  As a person from the energy business, I can assure the students and faculty of PDPU that you are entering an exciting future.  What makes it even more exciting is the synergy between the Energy Revolution and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. If we master this synergy, we will surely be able to make India one of the most prosperous nations in the world. An India that guarantees prosperity and wellbeing for all 1.3 billion Indians.  Honourable Chief Minister Shri Rupani ji, Gujarat is a trailblazer state. It has always shown the pioneer spirit. Today the entire world acknowledges that NEW GUJARAT has paved the path for NEW INDIA. The visionary leadership of Shri Narendra Modi ji that Gujarat received is now available to the nation.  I must compliment you and your team for making Vibrant Gujarat even more vibrant under the guidance of Shri Modi ji and Shri Amit Shah ji.  Here is our solemn assurance to you today. PDPU will continue to make its unique contribution to enhancing the reputation of Gujarat and India in energy education and research.  My dear Young Graduates, I see in you, 2,608 future builders of a strong, proud and vibrant India. My heartiest congratulations to you on your success. May all your dreams come true as you embark on a new journey in your life.  However, always remember an important life lesson. Learning is a constant and never-ending process of exploration, discovery and adventure. A true student never stops the pursuit of knowledge.  Therefore, here is my message to you, and I am only repeating Mahatma Gandhi's wise words: &quot;Learn for life, Learn through life, and Learn throughout life&quot;.  I have another message for you. When you step out of this beautiful campus, you will no doubt carry wonderful memories with you.  But perhaps you will also carry some concern, some uncertainty, some anxiety about the future.  This is only natural. The COVID situation will likely accentuate your thoughts and feelings.  Therefore, I would like to tell you with great emphasis today...venture out with supreme hope and confidence. The future is very bright for India, for you, and for all Indians.  This, our ancient nation, has faced many adversities in the past. And has emerged stronger each time. This is because resilience is in the very DNA of Indian people, Indian culture.  In the post-COVID era, I clearly foresee explosive and exponential growth in the Indian economy. Within a couple of decades, India will be among the top three economies in the world.  Growth will create unprecedented opportunities and possibilities for young and talented people like you. Indeed, most of these opportunities will be created by young entrepreneurs themselves. I see many amongst you as the creators of successful startups.  The world is waiting for you. Step out and take the plunge. Fail, if necessary, but in pursuit of your dreams. With passion, purpose and persistent effort, your dreams will indeed come true.  We, at PDPU, take pride in now calling you our alumni – our ambassadors. Make all of us at PDPU proud. Make your parents proud. Make India proud.  Once again, my hearty congratulations to the Class of 2019 and 2020. Good luck and God bless.  Thank you.

The mega transaction cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to its ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  Reliance Retail-Future Group deal: RIL unit adds Future Group’s retail business to shopping cart for Rs 24,713 crore.   The Future Group houses leading retail formats, including supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory. The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into Future Enterprises Ltd (FEL).  The announcement comes as a setback to Amazon.com which has claimed that Future Group violated its agreement with the US e-commerce giant by entering into the deal with RIL.  Amazon had moved the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October and won an interim stay on the deal. The SIAC passed the interim order asking Future Group to hold its plans of selling its retail business to RIL on October 25.   Amazon, last year, had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into FRL after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owned a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.  Along with this, Amazon even wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and CCI seeking a stay on the deal.  Later, Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) on November 7 moved the Delhi High Court against Amazon.com for interfering in its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Industries (RIL) by misusing the arbitration order passed by SIAC.

RI,2020-10-26T21:32:40+05:30,PTI,"BP eyes India's fuel market, wants gas in GST: CEO Bernard Looney","On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, Looney said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. ","Labelling India as an extraordinary country growing at an incredible scale, energy supermajor BP Plc on October 26 said it is looking to expand its presence in the nation in fuel retailing and mobility solutions, but wanted natural gas to be included in the GST regime. Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, BP Group chief executive Bernard Looney said his firm in partnership with Reliance Industries Ltd will in the next 4-5 years set up 5,500 retail sites that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also offer mobility solutions like EV charging facility.  &quot;India is an extraordinary country with an extraordinary history, an extraordinary group of people, and with extraordinary ambition,&quot; he said, adding the country has a growing population, and an ambitious agenda to cut emissions. This, he said, was &quot;very, very compelling&quot;.  &quot;Why is India important, because it is India,&quot; he said, adding energy mix in the country could fall from 50 percent coal to 40 percent, while gas and renewables will grow. Looney said India will be the fastest-growing fuel and lubricant market in the next 20 years and his group's venture with Reliance will grow the network of petrol pumps to 5,500 in the next 4-5 years from the current 1,400.  As many as 80,000 jobs will be created in the building of the network, he said, adding the venture will offer mobility solutions under the Jio-BP brand. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These have been taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and will be grown in the future. While petrol pumps will be expanded to 5,500, aviation refuelling facilities will grow to 45. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports.  RIL holds 51 percent in the new joint venture company, while BP has the remaining 49 percent. BP paid about Rs 7,000 crore to acquire the 49 percent stake. This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought a 30 percent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India. RIL-BP is investing $5 billion in developing the next set of discoveries in the KG Basin D6 block.  &quot;Our production with Reliance will account for 15 percent of India gas production,&quot; he said. Looney said while the company feels the ease of doing business on the ground, India is a complex market.  GST was a welcome federal initiative to ease trade and it will be good if natural gas is included in that. When Goods and Services Tax (GST), which amalgamated 17 different central and state levies like excise duty and VAT, was implemented in July 2017, five products – petrol, diesel, crude oil, aviation turbine fuel, and natural gas, were kept out of its purview for the time being.  This meant that gas users could not set off tax paid on inputs against those on the final product and tax on tax continued, disincentivising the use of the fuel. He said BP has a &quot;deep, trusting relationship&quot; with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.  On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, he said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. But communities around the world are demanding more affordable, reliable, and clean energy and BP was committed to providing solutions for the same, he said.  Speaking at the same event, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said India is one of the largest markets in the world for energy, but its per capita consumption is just 30 percent of the world average, offering huge potential. &quot;We want to be an important part of India,&quot; he said, adding the French group is investing in setting up LNG import terminal, city gas expansion, and renewable energy projects in the country.

Every time we have announced one, it has been after much deliberation and aimed at specific sections. If there is a need, further stimulus is an option I am open to,” Sitharaman said at the launch of 15th Finance Commission Chairman NK Singh’s autobiography.  “We have only now started doing some sort of assessment (of the economy and budget numbers). We have had inputs now which are very different from July. Sometime, we will have to come out with a statement, whether I do it in public or Parliament is what we have to decide,” she said.  The Finance Ministry has begun the exercise of preparing the 2021-22 Union Budget. The first part of the process is coming up with revised estimates for the current fiscal year, in this case FY21. It remains to be seen if the finance ministry would present fresh GDP numbers for the current year before the Union Budget for next year.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has projected a contraction of 9.5 percent in real GDP for FY21, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecast a contraction of 10.3 percent.  Speaking at the launch, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said India was perfectly placed to embrace cleaner sources of energy over the coming decades. Listing transformation of energy as one of his aims, he said: “India is in the right space to move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the next few decades.”  Ambani also said transformation of India into a digital society and transformation of the education system were some of the initiatives he was planning to undertake.
