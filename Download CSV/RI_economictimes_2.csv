RI,2024-03-01T17:28:00+05:30,PTI,"Viacom-Star merger will substantially reduce bargaining power, says advertising industry","The merger of Walt Disney's Indian media business with Reliance Industries' Viacom18 will create a dominant player in the Indian media industry. The merged entity will have over 70 channels from Star India, 38 TV channels from Viacom18, Jio Cinema, and Hotstar. It will control 75-80% of the Indian sports market in both linear TV and digital platforms.","New Delhi: The merger of the Indian media business of Walt Disney with Reliance Industries' Viacom18 will create a  significant dominant player , which might reduce the bargaining power for media buying agencies, the country's advertising industry has said. The Rs 70,000-crore behemoth, created post-merger may enable it to exert greater control over pricing and inventory of media rights and also influence over content, advertising industry leaders said.  According to the experts, the merged entity will almost have a monopoly in sports properties as it will collectively control 75-80 per cent of the Indian sports market, in both linear TV and digital platforms and may uptick the rates.  The joint venture, which is expected to receive approvals by the first quarter of 2025, will have over 70 channels from Star India and 38 TV channels from Viacom18 in eight languages, along with two large OTT platforms -- Jio Cinema and Hotstar -- and two film studios owned by each of them.   The Star-Viacom merger will substantially reduce the bargaining power of the media buying agencies,  Rediffusion Chairman Sandeep Goyal told PTI.  Last year, media buyers and clients reduced rates during the Indian Premier League (IPL), playing the broadcaster versus the digital rights holder, he said.   That will not happen now. This year, I think there will be an uptick in IPL rates,  Goyal added.  Expressing similar views, Dentsu South Asia CEO Harsha Razdan said this combination  heightens competition and enhances the negotiating power of the newly merged entity, enabling it to exert greater control over pricing and inventory .   Once it has cleared all industry-specific regulation protocols, the combination should create a significantly dominant player in the market, wielding substantial influence over content creation, distribution, and consumption trends,  he said.  According to a joint report from industry body Ficci and EY, the Indian advertising industry crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in 2022.  The report estimates the ad industry to grow at 11 per cent till 2025 and expects it to cross Rs 1.42 lakh crore by 2025, in which traditional media, such as TV, will have a 46 per cent contribution and the remaining 54 per cent will be from new age digital media.  Razdan further said the newly merged entity presents a dual prospect of opportunities and challenges for the advertising and marketing sector.  On the positive side, it provides extensive reach to the industry with its diverse portfolio of channels and platforms, but it also enhances the negotiating power of the newly merged entity.   I hope that in the coming years, the merger achieves a balanced outcome. It is crucial to maintain two or three major players in the market to foster a healthy and competitive environment, which ultimately should serve the end consumer,  he said.  Elara Capital Senior Vice-President, Karan Taurani said the monopoly in sports properties may lead to higher ad revenues of the merged entity.  Disney and Jio collectively control 75-80 per cent of the Indian sports market across both linear TV and digital platforms, he added.   This dominance in sports, primarily cricket, will help command a substantial share of the overall ad market, showcasing strong growth in an industry where sports is a key viewership driver for both linear TV and digital platforms,  said Taurani.  In CY22, sports advertising expenditure in the country stood at Rs 7,100 crore jointly for TV and digital, in which Disney India had a contribution of 80 per cent.  The combined entity will have lucrative sports properties, including the IPL (both TV and digital), ICC cricket tournaments (both TV and digital), Wimbledon, Pro Kabaddi League, and BCCI domestic cricket.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/services/advertising/viacom-star-merger-will-substantially-reduce-bargaining-power-says-advertising-industry/articleshow/108140634.cms

Additionally, it will be granted exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India and will have access to existing content libraries from both entities.“With Reliance well-known for disrupting the industry it enters, we will not be surprised to see this power deal have a material impact on the ad revenue and a faster deterioration in market share of other peers such as Zee, Sun TV, Airtel, and Vodafone,” said Manish Chowdhury, head of research, StoxBox. “The Reliance-Disney joint venture will sport the most lucrative cricketing rights in India and have a 40% share of the advertising market, opening avenues for better ad inventory monetisation and content cost reduction with lower competition.”The merged entity will have a revenue of 25,000 crore compared to 8,500 of Zee, or 7,000 crore of Sony or 4,000 crore of for Sun TV Network.Also, the JV will be particularly strong in sports content distribution due to existing broadcasting rights and the presence of sports channels like Star Sports and Sports 18.“This presence in multiple categories will help the entity understand and capitalize on shifts in consumer preferences and access new content at more competitive prices compared to other players in the industry, thus creating challenges for existing players like Zee, Dish, and Sun TV,” said Yashovardhan Khemka, Analyst, Abans Holding.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/ril-disney-jv-may-impact-media-shares-unfavourably-analysts/articleshow/108120838.cms

The company faces weakened competitive position, reduced bargaining power, tough competition from digital media, and corporate governance issues. Zee shares have lost 44% of their value this year.","With billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RIL) and Viacom18 joining forces with Disney to create a Rs 70,000 crore worth broadcast network, debt-ridden Zee Entertainment Enterprises will now have a tougher time finding an investor that can compete with India's richest tycoon. Zee, which has already been struggling since its merger breakdown with Sony, should be negatively impacted by the creation of a larger entity. Both content producers and advertisers are likely to gravitate towards the RIL-Disney entity, which will also cater to the largest set of audience, further weakening its overall competitive position,  said Pulkit Chawla of Emkay Global.Jio's marketing muscle would also make it more difficult for Zee to grow, he said, adding that the Disney deal leaves Zee with a lesser number of suitors, thus further lowering its bargaining power.Sony is said to have withdrawn the agreement to merge its India operations with Zee, taking the final step in scrapping a two-year-old plan that sought to create a $10 billion media giant, Bloomberg reported earlier in the day.Given the structural risk from digital and OTT platforms, analysts say companies that do not participate in consolidation face a risk of marginalization. Prima facie, this consolidation is negative for Zee, Sony and Sun. Separately, reduced competition in sports would likely weigh on monetization of IPL media rights in the next auction (2028)—negative for IPL franchisees in the long term,  said Jaykumar Doshi of Kotak Equities.Also read | Reliance shares rally but TV18, Network18 fall 5% as investors react to Ambani-Disney dealThe Disney JV will be controlled by RIL and owned 16.34% by RIL, 46.82% by Viacom18, and 36.84% by Disney. Viacom18 is a subsidiary of TV18 Broadcast, which in turn is a subsidiary of Network18 Media & Investments, in which RIL holds a 73.15% stake.The deal, which is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2024 or the first quarter of CY 2025, will lead to the creation of the single-largest player in both the broadcasting and digital space. The combined accounts for 40% market share in linear TV and OTT advertising markets combined. It can consolidate the ad inventory across all cricketing events and monetize better with lower competition. It is also looking at better monetization via customized ads on its FTTH + FWA broadband platform wherein it is bundling content and internet access at Rs 100/month premium to what competitors are charging for internet access only,  Jefferies said.Viacom18 has a portfolio of 40 channels and an OTT platform – JioCinema.

While Russia remains the dominant supplier, Indian refiners are increasingly buying more from Saudi Arabia. Refiners are eager to increase purchases of Russian oil, but require US approval to do so.","Tightening enforcement of US sanctions is denting India’s oil trade with Russia, forcing processors to consider other supplies, according to refinery executives familiar with the matter.Russia is still the dominant supplier to India, but there are signs refiners are buying more from elsewhere. Overall imports from Saudi Arabia are 22% higher this month than January, with the biggest private refiner — Reliance Industries Ltd. — taking its highest volume since May 2020, according to Kpler.India’s refiners are keen to take more Russian oil, but there would need to be US approval for buying to ramp up again, the executives said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. 108102941Russian oil is now only $2-$4 a barrel cheaper than other supplies and double-digit discounts are unlikely to return due to competition for barrels from China, the executives said.

At its peak last year, crude from the OPEC+ producer accounted for almost half of the nation’s purchases, but fresh US sanctions has recently stranded some cargoes.Moscow is also seeking payment in yuan due to increased scrutiny by some banks over using dirhams to settle the trade in the past few months, said a refinery executive and a government official.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/energy/oil-gas/india-looks-elsewhere-for-oil-as-us-sanctions-crimp-russia-trade/articleshow/108102930.cms

Reliance controls over 60% of the new entity, securing a powerful position in India's entertainment market. The joint venture gains exclusive rights to distribute Disney content in India and marks a significant boost for Reliance's streaming platform, Jio Cinema","Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has signed a binding agreement with Walt Disney Co. to form an $8.5 billion media giant through a merger of their operations in the country, securing a dominant position in one of the world’s fastest-growing entertainment markets.Ambani’s oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. will control over 60% of the new unit — 16% directly and 47% via the Viacom18 Media Pvt. Ltd. business it largely owns — while 37% goes to Disney, said a joint statement issued late Wednesday by the companies.Reliance will invest another 115 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) in the new unit as growth capital and Disney may contribute certain additional assets after getting regulatory approvals. The joint venture, which creates the largest player in the local broadcasting and digital sector, will get exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India, along with a license to more than 30,000 Disney content assets.The binding pact, which Bloomberg reported on Feb. 25 had been signed, secures Reliance’s position in Asia’s biggest entertainment market, especially after a rival merger between Japan’s Sony Group Corp. and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. collapsed last month. Disney had initially pursued a far higher valuation for its India arm in merger talks, and the final deal reflects Ambani’s clout in a landscape that the American giant struggled to navigate on its own. “The overall value reflects a significant reduction in Disney’s valuation,” that was estimated to be as much as $17 billion when Disney purchased 21st Century Fox in 2019, Pulkit Chawla, a sector analyst with Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. wrote in a report Thursday. “The deal, however, would hurt other industry players like Zee, as they would have to compete with a much larger entity.”Reliance shares rose as much as 1.6% in Mumbai during trading, the most in two weeks, while Zee slipped as much as 2.9%. Other local media stocks were fell on Thursday.Intense competition and fragmented viewing habits — demand for regional language content, for example — has made it challenging for foreign streaming platforms like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video to see the success they’ve had in other markets.Streaming PotentialThe deal is a massive boost for Reliance’s streaming platform, Jio Cinema, as it can now offer Disney-Star India’s content library alongside its traditional sports broadcasting lineup. Reliance and Disney have been rivals, with the Indian company outbidding the American one in 2022 for rights to the Indian Premier League, the $6.2 billion cricket juggernaut. Viacom18 Media also managed to grab multi-year rights to Warner Bros Discovery Inc.’s HBO shows like Succession, House of the Dragon and The Last of Us among others last year, which had earlier been with Disney in India.Nita Ambani will serve as the chairperson of the joint venture and Uday Shankar is slated to be the vice chairperson, said the statement.

The IPRS, which claims to be an unsecured creditor of both entities, had contended that the two parties had gone ahead with the scheme of arrangement without its consent.The NCLT had ruled that postponing or staying the scheme's process based on IPRS' claims would not be appropriate as its locus to object to the scheme had not been established.It also said that the proposed scheme provides sufficient scope for IPRS' interests to be protected in the event its credentials as a creditor get established.The IPRS has claimed dues of Rs 128 crore from Star India and Novi Digital Entertainment for the period April 2018 to March 2023 as per its published tariff.On February 21, the NCLAT reserved its judgment after hearing the counsels of Star India, Novi Digital Entertainment and IPRS in full. It also asked the parties to submit their notes of submissions and citations to the office of the registry through e-filing within three working days.As per the scheme of arrangement, Novi Digital Entertainment will get amalgamated into Star India, a move that will help the Walt Disney-owned company achieve economies of scale, enable synergies, increase operational efficiencies, put a greater emphasis on growth, make the best use of resources and lower costs.In meetings held on February 8, 2023, the boards of both Star India and Novi Digital Entertainment accepted the merger plan with effect from April 1, 2022.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/nclt-adjourns-hearing-on-star-india-novi-digital-merger/articleshow/108092690.cms

It will have over 750 million viewers across the country and will also cater to the Indian diaspora across the world, the companies said in a statement issued on Wednesday. The merger will create a media giant with a combined FY23 topline of ₹25,000 crore.Mukesh Ambani-led RIL and Bob Iger-led Walt Disney have signed binding, definitive agreements, capping over four months of hectic negotiations. ET was the first to report that Reliance and Disney signed a non-binding term sheet on December 25. As reported by ET on February 28, Nita Ambani will serve as chairperson of the merged entity, while former Star India boss Uday Shankar will provide  strategic guidance  as vice chairperson. 'Landmark agreement'  This is a landmark agreement that heralds a new era in the Indian entertainment industry,  RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani was cited as saying in the statement.  This strategic joint venture... will help us pool our extensive resources, creative prowess, and market insights to deliver unparalleled content at affordable prices to audiences across the nation.

With this fund infusion, RIL's total investment in the media business amounts to ₹22,000 crore in the past year. In April 2023, it had invested over ₹10,839 crore as part of a ₹15,145 crore fund injection in Viacom18 that saw Bodhi Tree Systems invest ₹4,306 crore. Bodhi Tree is promoted jointly by James Murdoch and Shankar.On a post-money basis, the Star-Viacom18 venture will be valued at ₹70,352 crore ($8.5 billion).

He had led Star under both Fox and Disney before calling it quits in December 2020.Based on the shareholding in the joint venture, Viacom18's stake is valued at approximately $4 billion, while that of Star is slightly over $3 billion, a far cry from the $15 billion that it once commanded. Disney had acquired Star as part of a $71 billion Fox entertainment asset acquisition in 2019, during Iger's previous tenure at Disney.The venture will be granted exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India, with a licence to more than 30,000 Disney content assets, providing a full suite of entertainment options for the Indian consumer, according to the statement.The transaction is expected to be completed in the last quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory, shareholder and customary approvals.The deal will see the exit of Paramount Global from Viacom18.

Reliance will be the senior partner and the deal aims to leverage Reliance's understanding of the Indian market. The partnership will create a media powerhouse in India.,"NEW DELHI: The Walt Disney Co. announced Wednesday a joint venture with India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Industries, in an $8.5 billion deal that will create a media powerhouse in the world's most populous nation and end Disney's decadeslong solo effort to gain a foothold in the market. Reliance Industries, which is owned by Mukesh Ambani, India's richest person, will be Disney's senior partner in the deal. With $239 billion in market capitalization and rights to the wildly popular Indian Premier League cricket matches, Reliance is a juggernaut in the media landscape in India. Disney and Reliance already had a combined market share of about 40% to 45% in advertising and about the same fraction of streaming, giving them a big edge over competitors, said Karan Taurani, a research analyst at Elara Capital.  This will lead to better profitability because the content costs could come down  in both TV and streaming, Taurani said. As part of the deal, Disney will merge its Indian operations with those of Viacom18, a part of Reliance Industries. Reliance and Viacom18 will hold 63% of the new venture, and Disney 37%, the companies said in a statement. Reliance will pay $1.4 billion to consolidate its control. Nita M. Ambani, Mukesh Ambani's wife, will be the chair of the joint venture; the vice chair will be Uday Shankar, the former chair of Disney India.  Reliance has a deep understanding of the Indian market and consumer,  Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, said in a statement.  We're excited for the opportunities that this joint venture will provide to create long-term value.  Disney is one of the biggest companies in the world, valued at $200 billion; in India, though, it proved no match for the homegrown hero. Disney first came to India, now a country of 1.4 billion potential media consumers, in 1993 and found a distributor to broadcast some of its content. Along with India's market, Disney's ambitions grew. Last year, accounting and consulting firm EY estimated that India's media landscape would be worth $30 billion this year and $100 billion by 2030. And Disney banked on bringing hundreds of millions of subscribers to its own streaming services. Disney's adventures in India were at their high point in 2019, when it bought 21st Century Fox from the Murdoch family's News Corp. Among Fox's assets, Disney won TV and streaming rights to the Indian Premier League cricket matches. Big subscriber numbers followed but at great cost. At its pandemic-fueled peak, Disney+ had 162 million subscribers in India, but it was losing almost $500 million worldwide in pursuit of viewers. By summer 2022, its global operations had bled more than $11 billion since the purchase of Fox and launch of Disney+. That is when Disney ran into trouble. Reliance Industries snatched away the cricket rights in 2022 for nearly $3 billion. Disney lost 11.5 million Indian subscribers in short order, even as it gained 800,000 new ones in the rest of the world. Still, Disney is not abandoning India.  India remains a key market for the company and one of the strongest international growth markets of scale, and we are committed to ensuring a robust presence there,  Disney executives said in an email to employees Wednesday.When Reliance was started by Mukesh Ambani's father in 1958, it was a trading shop, mainly of polyester fiber. It grew into petrochemicals and now runs the world's largest oil refinery at the port in Jamnagar, on a remote bit of India's western coastline. Along the way, it got into telecommunications and other businesses, and in 2016 started a low-cost mobile network, Jio, which quickly became the world's third-largest. JioCinema, part of a growing family of Jio properties but a relatively small platform when India's streaming wars began, looks likely to become the new home for Disney's content in India. At one point another rival looked ready to emerge, as Japanese media giant Sony was seeking to expand its operations in India by buying Zee Entertainment. With Zee, India's first private cable-TV company, Sony would have been big enough to divide up the TV-and-digital market with Reliance and Disney. But Sony backed out of its deal with Zee on Jan. 22, frustrated by the founding family's insistence on maintaining control. Sony's breakup with Zee seems to have made things even harder for Disney. For one thing, Zee still owes Disney for cricket licensing. Bloomberg reported that the estimated value of Disney's India unit sank to $4.5 billion from $10 billion. Sony's failed merger also made the eventual Disney deal look sweeter for Ambani: What would have been a landscape defined by two giants is instead looking likely to be dominated by just one. Being such a sprawling conglomerate, Reliance has an advantage in the battles for media domination. It does not need content to pay for itself directly. When their subscribers are brought into their retail, telecom and credit operations, the cost of making shows looks small by comparison to combined revenue.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-to-step-back-from-india-in-mega-deal-with-reliance-industries/articleshow/108087431.cms

RI,2024-02-29T00:40:00+05:30,Arijit Barman,From September to a shaadi: How Disney found a new home for Mickey Mouse in India,"The genesis of the Reliance Disney negotiations was in the fall of 2023 but it gathered momentum after Walbrooke visited the Reliance Mumbai office in October followed by Kevin Mayer and Manoj Modi catching up just before Christmas at the Ambani residence in Stoke Park, London, to shake hands and sign a non binding term sheet with a February 17th deadline.","Ever since he landed in Mumbai a week or so ago to help give the final touches to the Reliance-Star India mega merger that was announced on Wednesday, Justin Warbrooke had been struck by a sense of déjà vu. Many years ago, Warbrooke, a Kiwi by birth but with a cool quotient that is innately Californian, had flown into and camped for weeks in India’s financial capital to play matchmaker and close another strategic transaction for his firm — Walt Disney Co’s buyout of Ronnie Srewvala’s UTV Software Communications Ltd, in tranches starting 2006. He was a young executive then, but handles a senior role in Corporate and Business Strategy. A lot of time has lapsed between the two trades. Mumbai arguably is more polluted, a skyline that resembles a mashup between Singapore and Dubai but minus the infrastructure. Yet some things remain the same.If the UTV investment and subsequent buyout gave Walt Disney a chance to make a comeback after its first India tie up with KK Modi Group in 1993 went south, the merger with Mukesh Ambani’s flagship Reliance Industries is expected to give the US media giant, a fresh lease of life in Asia’s biggest streaming market after several missteps ranging from losses in sports to losing top talent. In retrospect, with the UTV deal also underachieving compared to what was originally envisaged, Disney-Reliance had to be a case of being third time lucky.ET spoke to several executives and officials to piece together all the action that played out behind the scenes of this $8.5 billion stock and cash corporate alliance that is no less racy than a thriller. Most spoke on condition of anonymity. The genesis was in the fall of 2023 and a climax just before the grand pre-wedding party for Ambani’s youngest son Anant in Jamnagar this weekend -- all in a span of five months or so. That’s in sharp contrast with another mega merger that took two years to be called off last month.Disney to the partyThe entire Disney top brass including chief executive Bob Iger, advisor Kevin Mayer, Walbrook and K Madhavan Country Manager and President, Disney Star in India are expected to attend the three day jamboree in Jamnagar as special guests. Interestingly, that is where the two main actors of this biggest media story playing across television screens and OTT platforms in India today -- Mukesh Ambani, the 66 yr old chairman of Reliance Industries, also the richest man of the country, and his peer Robert “Bob” Iger will meet in person for the first time ever since the negotiations between both sides began around last September. Both stayed away from the deal maths, manoeuvres or the merger minutiaes. Instead they sent two of their key lieutenants Manoj Modi and Mayers to hammer it out on the playing field.Mayer, once seen as Iger’s likely successor, especially after the launch of Disney+, who had worked closely with the CEO on a series of acquisitions and was a key architect of Disney’s streaming strategy before leaving the firm to start Candle Partners, also a media group, only to be cherry picked and parachuted back last July to “turn around” Disney after Iger was brought in 2022 and then given a 2 year extension to fix the behemoth that was broken in every corner – soaring expenses, furious fans of its once vaunted theme parks, striking screenwriters, dipping revenues, uneven performance of Lucasfilm and Disney’s animation and live-action releases and activist shareholders baying for blood.        108087044Mission IndiaMayer’s India mandate from Iger was simple: a holistic solution and not piecemeal slump sale of assets or businesses. An exit from one of the most promising markets that is consuming content on terabytes of free data was also out of the question.For both Mayer and his colleague Tom Staggs who also had left Disney to start Candle, with the backing of Blackstone, but brought back as Iger’s “advisors”, the world’s largest PE firm was an obvious pit stop. They have a sizable presence in India and had over the years scoped several media assets including Sony’s local operations, Airtel DTH, Dish TV and Eenadu; and had bought into Jagran Media Network. It had also weighed a co-investment with Star in Asianet for a minority stake, after Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling interest in the Kerala-based network from Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a former telecom-and-media business magnate and the current minister of state for electronics and information technology. Madhavan, himself was the managing director and CEO of Asianet at the time.In parallel, Madhavan too was talking to potential suitors including Carlyle to put together an investment consortium that would pump in at least a billion dollars and resuscitate Star India and consolidate his position, people aware said.But for any financial investor, this was a tough call with Jio changing the rules of the game by offering free streaming and cheap data. The financial returns were just not stacking up. “Media in India is also a highly regulated sector with sparring media conglomerates,” said an executive in the know on condition of anonymity. “Which PE firm would want to take on Reliance in India.” None of those conversations therefore moved ahead much. Return of the JediEnter Reliance.As talks progressed, Mayer had roped in Walbrooke, a rainmaker who now wears many hats -- head of international finance, CFO, direct-to-consumer business, and international head of business operations, to help him . Walbrooke, himself a company man, joined as a manager after a stint in consulting about two decades back, knew what his bosses and board were seeking. Once the broad contours were in place, it gathered momentum after Walbrooke visited the Reliance Mumbai office in October followed by Mayer and Modi catching up just before Christmas at the Ambani residence in Stoke Park, London, to shake hands and sign a non binding term sheet with a February 17th deadline.Both businesses too were to be treated as similar-sized ones, a far cry from Star India’s $15 billion valuation that was often thrown around after Murdoch family crown jewel was acquired in 2019.Meanwhile, bankers, the valuation specialists from the big and a bevy of lawyers were already tasked to draw out the finer points. By November, the structure too was also clear – create a step-down subsidiary of Viacom18 Media, which will absorb Star India via a stock swap to avoid significant equity dilution of existing partners of Viacom 18.Viacom18’s entertainment network in the country is a partnership between Ambani’s TV18 Broadcast, Paramount Global and Bodhi Tree Systems.The combined business also needed money largely on account of the mounting losses of Disney’s sports franchise in India after its jaw dropping Rs 23,575 crore IPL TV rights for the 2023-27 cycle. Iger was not over eager putting more cash at this juncture considering globally it only just about “turned a corner” in the quarter ending February 2024 and announced a $3 billion share buyback programme and a 50% dividend increase to soothe its investors' nerves. So Reliance Industries stepped in with a cheque of Rs 11,500 crore (~$ 1.4 billion). That made Reliance Group (including Viacom 18) the controlling shareholder with 63.16% shareholding.“Both Reliance, Disney are no pushovers. Both were looking at scale, and Disney retained a meaningful stake for future upside. This is a happy ending for both.” quipped a Reliance executive. “This is a merger but with unequal shareholding.”Two sides are putting equity instead of one buying the other out for cash. Even the junior shareholder will have rights, added a Disney executive, just before picking his wedding wardrobe for Ambani Junior and Radhika Merchant wedding nuptials with echoes of another union in the background.With Rihanna, AP Dhillon, Daljit Dosanjh performing in Jamnagar, you don’t want to forget your dancing shoes, do you?",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/from-september-to-a-shaadi-how-disney-found-a-new-home-for-mickey-mouse-in-india/articleshow/108083395.cms

She is also the founder of the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre in Mumbai which has become a key venue for music and theatre.
