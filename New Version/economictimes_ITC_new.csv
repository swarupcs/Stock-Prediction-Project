And they do, more often than not. In Budget 2024 though, cigarettes were left untouched as the govt announced no tax hike on tobacco products.This year's Union Budget was presented on July 23 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. No increase was made to the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on cigarettes, which has been a key area for potential adjustment in tobacco taxation in the past.While the GST Council holds the primary authority over tobacco product taxation, the central government also has the power to adjust the NCCD during the Union Budget. The NCCD rates were last modified with a 16 percent increase in the previous year, but they remained unchanged in the recent Budget speech.Following the announcement, shares of India’s largest cigarette manufacturer, ITC, surged nearly 5 percent.ITC relies heavily on its cigarette segment for revenue, with the product accounting for more than 80 per cent of the company’s net profit and approximately 45 per cent of its total revenue.According to an Economic Times report, ITC shares have consistently posted positive returns on Budget Day over the past decade, even amid several tweaks in the NCCD tax.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/cons-products/tobacco/cigarettes-wont-buy-a-bigger-hole-in-smokers-pocket-this-year-as-budget-leaves-prices-unchanged/articleshow/111981389.cms

A 5% jump followed after the government kept tobacco tax rates unchanged. Taxation, handled by the GST Council, includes NCCD on cigarettes, adjustable in Budget.","Shares of diversified conglomerate ITC have surged nearly 10% in the last 2 days, crossing the Rs 500 mark and reaching a new all-time high of Rs 510.60 in today’s session on BSE.The shares of ITC had surged as much as 5% in Tuesday’s session after the government decided to maintain the current tax rates on cigarettes and other tobacco products.While tobacco taxation primarily falls under the purview of the GST Council, the central government also imposes National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on cigarettes, which can be adjusted in the Budget.For ITC, cigarettes constitute over 80% of the company’s net profit and approximately 45% of its revenue. Consequently, changes in taxes significantly affect the company's financial performance.Post the Budget, global brokerage Jefferies has upgraded the stock from hold to buy and increased the target price to Rs 585 from Rs 435.Stating that “no news is great news”, Jefferies said that the GST taxes are also likely to stay stable until Mar-26 until center settles state dues and the demand outlook for the staple sector is improving, which should benefit key businesses of ITC. The next year’s budget in Feb 2025 will gain prominence but a modest price hike this year will set a base for next year. The taxation regime has been stable recently, supporting volume growth in the legal cigarette industry and contributing to tax collections,  BofA stated. ITC's cigarette business has seen volume recovery in FY23 and FY24, with cigarette volume almost at par with its peak volumes in FY13. Stability in taxes and various government initiatives to curb illegal cigarettes have been supporting the legal cigarette market. ITC has done various product innovations in the last 2-3 years to consolidate its market share,  another domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said. We increase weight behind ITC by 50 bps as the current cigarette taxation environment will provide upside in the stock after a long consolidation. A revival in FMCG and paperboard profitability from 2H25 and hotel demerger will further unlock value,  said Prabhudas.Further, the revised changes to new tax regimes would result in savings in the hands of consumers, which will in turn be positive for FMCG-related stocks including ITC.The shares of ITC ended at Rs 494.05 on BSE at close of day.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The budget also aims to create jobs, which will drive consumption in tier-2 and 3 cities. However, the increase in capital gains taxes could impede discretionary spending. ","The budget’s focus on infrastructure, rural outlay and tax savings is likely to fuel rural demand–crucial for sustained revival of packaged consumer goods and two-wheelers–while the focus on job creation will spur consumption in tier-2 and 3 cities, company executives said. The increase in capital gains taxes, however, could impede discretionary spending, they said.Rohit Jawa, MD and chief executive officer of the largest consumer goods company, HUL, said the budget is consumption friendly and will help FMCG categories going forward.The budget has increased allocation towards education, skilling and employment, revised tax rates and raised the standard deduction to Rs 75,000 from Rs 50,000 under the new tax regime, which would result in savings of around Rs 17,500 in net taxes in the hands of consumers“This would mean more disposable income that will lead to sustained demand for branded consumer goods,” Dabur CEO Mohit Malhotra said.According to Jawa, the announcements increasing investment on rural development, investment activities supporting one crore urban poor and schemes for youth employment are good for businesses like ours that serves consumers in nine out of ten households from all parts of the portfolio, mass to the premium.He said all of this will have a multiplier effect, driving consumers to spend more on consumption. “Broadly speaking, the priorities of the budget are bang on when it comes to what is required for nation building. So, I love the consistency of the budget and also the focus on mass consumption,” Jawa said.FMCG stocks surged, helping the Nifty FMCG index rise 2.68% to 62,511.25, buoyed by allocation of funds for rural development.

Rural demand had tapered off over the past five quarters on account of inflationary costs of food, daily essentials and fuel.“There will be a positive impact on rural demand, but we expect it will be a small one since the benefit for consumers will be only in the form of small tax savings. Others like job creation will have mid-tolong term impact,” Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi said.An allocation of Rs 2.66 lakh crore for rural development and Rs 26,000 crore for road connectivity would help last-mile distribution and better reach in rural areas, executives said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/cons-products/fmcg/budget-2024-news-rural-spending-more-money-in-consumers-hand-will-lead-to-a-rise-in-demand-for-consumer-goods/articleshow/111969440.cms

However, the introduction of new income tax benefits under the new tax regime offers some relief to taxpayers, potentially mitigating the negative impact on market sentiment.","The Modi 3.O government's first Budget post the re-election presents a mix of expected and surprising measures. While capital expenditure and the fiscal deficit target remain steady, analysts said significant changes to tax policies, particularly the increases in LTCG, STCG, and STT, are likely to impact the market sentiment.On the taxation front, the introduction of new income tax benefits under the new tax regime provides some relief to taxpayers. Overall, the Budget emphasizes fiscal discipline and targeted support for specific sectors, but its reception by different market segments will vary, with potential underperformance in midcap and smallcap stocks due to valuation concerns. Moving forward, the market's attention will likely shift to earnings reports and global cues,  said Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart.That said, here are 30 stocks from different sectors that will benefit from the Budget.1) Solar:Tata Power, Adani Green Energy, and Waaree EnergiesFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced free electricity of upto 300 units per month to 1 crore households under the Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana. This initiative will lower energy costs, improve living standards, and support economic stability.Additionally, it will benefit companies involved in rooftop solar solutions, such as Tata Power, Adani Green and Waaree Energies, according to Divyam Mour, Research Analyst at Samco Securities2) Banking SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Union Bank of India, AU Small Finance BankSitharaman has announced the extension of Mudra loans limit to Rs 20 lakh from Rs 10 lakh. The Mudra loans are disbursed through PSU banks, small finance banks, and NBFCs. Hence, the announcement of a limit extension will benefit companies like SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Union Bank of India, AU Small Finance Bank,  said Raj Gaikar, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities.3) Agriculture - CDSL, CE Info Systems, Genesys, Kaveri Seeds, Dhanuka AgritechThe Finance Minister announced several measures for the agriculture industry, including digitizing public infrastructure for their lands within 3 years for 6 crore farmers in partnership with states.  This will benefit companies like CDSL, CE Info Systems, Genesys,  said T Manish, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities.Further, the government has announced Rs 1.52 lakh crore provisioning to agriculture and allied sectors, which will aid companies like Kaveri Seeds, Dhanuka Agritech.4) Consumption Stocks - HUL, ITC, Dabur, Nestle, Polyplex, UflexThe Finance Minister announced a revised tax rate under the new tax regime and also hiked the standard deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 for individuals. This would result in savings of around Rs 17,500 in net taxes in the hands of individuals. This would benefit directly to the companies in the FMCG segment such as HUL, ITC, Dabur, Nestle and second order beneficiaries would be suppliers to these FMCG giants such as Polyplex, Uflex.5) Housing -- LIC Housing, PNB Housing, HUDCO, Aadhar Housing FinanceThe allocation of Rs 10 lakh crore for housing the urban poor is poised to significantly enhance the profitability of small ticket-size housing finance companies. Companies such as LIC Housing, PNB Housing, HUDCO, and Aadhar Housing Finance are expected to see an upward trajectory in revenue and PAT in the coming quarters, this potentially drives a surge in their share prices in the longer run,  said Raj Gaikar, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities6) Automobiles: Hero Motocorp and Maruti SuzukiThe government has proposed Rs 2.66 lakh crore for rural development. Furthermore, skill development initiatives are expected to lead to more rural employment. This would increase income levels in rural areas and could result in higher discretionary spending. Consequently, two-wheelers and entry-level passenger vehicles could see increased demand from rural India, benefiting companies like Hero Motocorp and Maruti Suzuki.7) Capital Goods - Dixon TechnologiesThe Finance Minister announced a cut in the basic customs duty (BCD) on mobile phones, mobile printed circuit design assembly (PCDA), and mobile chargers to 15%, recognizing the growth of the Indian mobile industry.

Standard deductions raised to Rs 75,000. Grant Thornton Bharat mentions Rs 1.52 lakh crore for the agricultural sector.","Demand for packaged consumer goods, which depend heavily on the rural economy, is expected to pick up in the hinterland after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget announcements on Tuesday. Executives said rural sops, increased focus on infrastructure and job creation will lead to higher demand in the hinterland, which contributes well over a third to overall sales of fast moving consumer goods.FMCG stocks surged in the day with the government’s focus on rural markets, jobs generation, agriculture and the middle class. ITC surged 5% on intraday basis, while Tata Consumer Products and Dabur India went up over 3% each, with the Nifty FMCG index moving up sharply in the day, fuelled by the government's allocation of funds for rural development.Dabur India chief executive officer Mohit Malhotra said the standout feature of the Union Budget was its focus on speeding up fiscal consolidation with the fiscal deficit being revised down 20 bps from the Interim Budget to 4.9%. “The Budget's push on urban and rural growth will help boost rural consumption and also increase discretionary spending,” he said.Increased allocation towards education, skilling and employment, and increase in standard deductions from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 and revision of tax rates under the New Tax regime will lead to savings of around Rs 17,500 in net taxes for consumers.

With this adjustment, we expect consumers to spend more because they would have higher disposable incomes,” he added.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/cons-products/fmcg/budget-to-spur-fmcg-demand-with-focus-on-jobs-infra-agriculture/articleshow/111965256.cms

Hunt for stocks in these 10 sectors,"Aimed at the trinity of fiscal prudence, investment, and growth momentum, the Union Budget saw the introduction of employment incentives and a simplified income tax regime, which should boost consumption.","Aimed at the trinity of fiscal prudence, investment, and growth momentum, the Union Budget saw the introduction of employment incentives and a simplified income tax regime, which should boost consumption.Investors were, however, caught off guard due to the increase in LTCG and STCG tax rates, leading to a knee-jerk reaction on D-Street. While the budget maintained infrastructure spending at the same level as the interim budget, disappointing expectations of a higher allocation from the RBI dividend, infrastructure stocks are likely to exhibit a gradual positive bias. On the positive side, increased focus on agriculture research and horticulture bodes well for companies like Avanti Feeds. The consumption sector is also expected to benefit from certain sops announced in the budget, with housing finance and cement stocks likely to be key beneficiaries,  said Sonam Srivastava, Manager and Founder, Wright Research.Here are 10 sectors which tend to benefit from Budget announcements:1) Jewellery stocksTo enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal jewellery in the country, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reduced customs duties on gold and silver to 6% and that on platinum to 6.4%. This may lead to a decline in domestic prices and lift demand. The existing duty on gold and silver is 15 percent which comprises 10% of basic custom duty and 5 percent as Agricultural Infrastructure Development cess.“This policy change is expected to significantly benefit companies like Titan and Kalyan Jewellers, enabling them to optimize their supply chains. This will increase their profit margins, and pass on cost savings to consumers,” said Siddhesh Mehta, Research Analyst, Samco Securities.2) Solar stocksBudget has expanded the list of exempted capital goods for use in the manufacture of solar cells and panels in India. PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana has generated remarkable response with more than 1.28 crore registrations and 14 lakh applications.“The Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana offers free electricity up to 300 units per month to 1 crore households. This initiative will lower energy costs, improve living standards, and support economic stability. It enhances energy access and promotes sustainable development, benefiting low-income families and local economies. Additionally, it will benefit companies involved in rooftop solar solutions, such as Tata Power, Adani Green Energy, and Waaree Energies Limited,” Divyam Mour, Research Analyst, Samco Securities, said.3) Bank stocksThe limit of Mudra loans will be enhanced to Rs 20 lakh from the current Rs 10 lakh for those entrepreneurs who have availed and successfully repaid previous loans under the ‘Tarun’ category.“Mudra loans are disbursed through PSU banks, small finance banks, and NBFC. Hence, the announcement of a limit extension will benefit companies like SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Union Bank of India, AU Small finance banks,” Raj Gaikar, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities, said.4) ManufacturingManufacturing sector has been fixed as one of the 9 priorities for Sitharaman in the Budget. It aims to incentivize additional employment in the manufacturing sector, linked to the employment of first-time employees.“This initiative will reimburse employers up to Rs 3,000 per month for two years towards EPFO contributions for each additional employee, aiming to incentivize the additional employment of 50 lakh people,” said Aamar Deo Singh of Angel One.5) Digitisation themeSitharaman has announced that land records in urban areas will be digitized with GIS mapping. She has also announced implementation of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their lands in 3 years. During this year, a digital crop survey for Kharif using the DPI will be taken up in 400 districts. The details of 6 crore farmers and their lands will be brought into the farmer and land registries.The news is positive for listed companies like Benefiting companies like CDSL, CE Info Systems, Genesys, etc.6) Consumption stocksFM has announced that the standard deduction for salaried employees in the new tax regime will increase from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000, which would result in savings of around Rs 17,500 in net taxes in the hands of individuals. “This would benefit directly to the companies in the FMCG segment such as HUL, ITC, Dabur, Nestle and second order beneficiaries would be suppliers to these FMCG giants such as Polyplex, Uflex. Further, increased saving would also boost the inflow to wealth management (AMC’s) in the form of SIPs, and to stock broking companies through brokerage,” T Manish, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities, said.7) HousingThe allocation of Rs 10 lakh crore for housing the urban poor is poised to significantly enhance the profitability of small ticket-size housing finance companies. Companies such as LIC Housing, PNB Housing, HUDCO, and Aadhar Housing Finance are expected to see an upward trajectory in revenue and PAT in the coming quarters, this potentially drives a surge in their share prices in the longer run, said Raj Gaikar, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities.8) AutoBudget has made a provision of Rs 2.66 lakh crore for rural development including rural infrastructure. “Skill development initiatives are expected to lead to more rural employment. This would increase income levels in rural areas and could result in higher discretionary spending. Consequently, two-wheelers and entry-level passenger vehicles could see increased demand from rural India, benefiting companies like Hero Motocorp and Maruti Suzuki. Additionally, since many vehicle purchases are financed to some extent, any interest rate cuts going forward could improve the demand for automobiles,” says Amar Nandu, Research Analyst, Samco Securities.9) Capital goodsBudget also saw a cut in basic customs duty on mobile phones, mobile Printed Circuit Design Assembly (PCDA), and mobile chargers to 15%, recognizing the growth of the Indian mobile industry.

ITC,2024-07-23T17:19:00+05:30,Writankar Mukherjee,Budget 2024: Stable taxation to improve cigarette volumes,BREAKING: Union Budget for 2024-25 keeps cigarette prices stable! Smokers rejoice as taxes remain unchanged. Analysts predict positive impact on tobacco industry. ITC reports decline in legal cigarette consumption in India. Will this lead to a shift in tobacco consumption habits?,"Smokers can cheer with the union Budget for 2024-25 not changing the taxes on cigarettes whereby prices will remain the same. The 2023-24 Budget had increased taxes on cigarettes marginally.Nuvama Institutional Equities executive director Abneesh Roy said any hike was unlikely given legal cigarette volumes are weak. Moreover, two consecutive back to back years of increase in cigarette taxes is rare in the past few years of the Modi government,” said Roy.Last year, the Budget increased national calamity contingent duty (NCCD) by 15-16%. NCCD is levied as a duty on the excise duty. Analysts said stable taxation is positive for the tobacco industry for next seven months when the 2025-26 budget will be announced.Cigarette stocks went up on Tuesday when the benchmark Sensex fell by 0.09%. Market leader ITC Ltd closed at a gain of 5.52% and VST Industries at 1.27% on the Bombay Stock Exchange. As per ITC’s latest annual report, taxes on cigarettes had increased sharply at a CAGR of 15.7% between FY13 to FY17. However, tax revenue from cigarettes grew a mere 4.7% CAGR. Thereafter, relative stability in taxation was observed until January 2020, revenue collections grew by 10.2%. ITC said in the report the share of legal cigarettes in total tobacco consumption in India has declined from 21% in 1981-82 to 9% last fiscal. Despite accounting for less than one-tenth of the tobacco consumed in the country, duty-paid cigarettes contribute more than four-fifths of the revenue generated from the tobacco sector.The company said “discriminatory and punitive taxation on cigarettes has led to progressive migration of consumption from duty-paid cigarettes to other lightly taxed/tax-evaded forms of tobacco products, comprising illicit cigarettes, bidi, chewing tobacco, gutkha, zarda and snuff.  ITC said India accounts for less than 2% of global cigarette consumption despite having 18% of the world’s population - making India’s per capita cigarette consumption amongst the lowest in the world.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/cons-products/tobacco/budget-2024-stable-taxation-to-improve-cigarette-volumes/articleshow/111962190.cms

However, the narrative is mixed, by curtailing expenditure while attaining fiscal prudence, which can limit further growth,  said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. During the year, the market has fairly factored in ongoing growth and trading at a high premium. To sustain that gap, corporate growth has to be maintained, which is experiencing a slowdown as per the ongoing Q1 result,  Nair added.Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares, said,  By forming a Small Red candle with a big lower shadow, the Index has tested and defended its strong support of 24,200. We believe that as long as the index holds 24,200, the uptrend will remain intact. On the higher side, 24,800 will continue to act as a strong hurdle.

Of late, the taxation regime has been stable aiding both volume growth for the legal cigarette industry and tax collections, BofA said.","Shares of diversified conglomerate ITC jumped as much as 5% after the government chose to continue with the existing tax rates on cigarettes and other tobacco products. The stock was last trading 4.67% higher at Rs 488.35 on the NSE.While taxation of tobacco is primarily under the purview of the GST Council, the central government also levies NCCD on cigarettes, subject to changes in the Budget.Of late, the taxation regime has been stable aiding both volume growth for the legal cigarette industry and tax collections, BofA said.Analysts had estimated the benign cigarette taxation to prevail, which will provide upside for the stock in the near term. We increase weight behind ITC by 50 bps as the current cigarette taxation environment will provide upside in the stock after long consolidation. A revival in FMCG and paperboard profitability from 2H25 and hotel demerger will further unlock value,  said Prabhudas.For ITC, cigarettes constitute more than 80% of the company’s net profit, and about 45% of its topline. Therefore, tinkering in taxes has an impact on the company’s financials.In the last 10 Budgets, shares of ITC have ended with positive returns on the Budget day despite several tweaks in NCCD tax over the years. ITC's cigarette business has seen volume recovery in FY23 and FY24, with cigarette volume almost at par with its peak volumes in FY13. Stability in taxes and various government initiatives to curb illegal cigarettes have been supporting the legal cigarette market. ITC has done various product innovations in the last 2-3 years to consolidate its market share,  Motilal said.Motilal Oswal estimates that the company can achieve low- to mid-single digit cigarette volume growth with mid- to high single-digit EBIT growth in the medium term.Further, the revised changes to new tax regimes would result in savings in the hands of consumers, which will in turn be positive for FMCG related stocks including ITC. The changes to income tax would benefit directly to the companies in the FMCG segment such as HUL, ITC, Dabur, Nestle,  said T Manish, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities.Track all the Union Budget and stock market updates here",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/itc-shares-jump-5-as-cigarettes-escape-tax-shocks-in-budget/articleshow/111954859.cms

IndusInd Bank follows at 80%. Worst ITC day was in 2020 due to excise duty hike. Analysts foresee no further hikes; Prabhudas Lilladher raised ITC weight citing stable taxes and business growth. Motilal Oswal projects cigarette volume and EBIT growth.,"While the subdued performance of ITC shares in the last one year may have thrown it off the watchlist of crores of retail investors on Dalal Street, the bluechip has the highest win rate on Budget days among all Sensex stocks.An analysis of how Sensex stocks have performed in the last 10 Budget days shows that ITC has ended with a positive return nine out of 10 times with an average return of 1.47%.Since 2016, the worst Budget day for ITC was in 2020 when the stock ended with a loss of around 7% after Nirmala Sitharaman raised excise duty, by way of National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD), on cigarettes and other tobacco products.   The next best performer on Budget days is IndusInd Bank, whose shares have not only had a win rate of 80% but have also given an average return of 2.5% on D-Day. Its peer Kotak Mahindra Bank has seen 8 out of 10 Budget days in green while HDFC Bank, TCS, and Nestle have enjoyed a 70% win rate.Budget expectationsAnalysts are not expecting any excise duty or NCCD duty hike on cigarettes in this Budget since price hikes were already taken in the last Budget and any increase in taxes will promote illegal consumption of tobacco. Taxes on cigarettes in India are 14x of US, 7x of Japan, and 6x of Germany.A modest tax hike like last year or no change could be viewed positively by the market. The taxation regime of late has been stable aiding both volume growth for the legal cigarette industry and tax collections, BofA said.Prabhudas Lilladher has increased weight behind ITC by 50bps saying that it expects benign cigarette taxation environment to prevail, which will provide upside in the stock after a long consolidation.

The pressure on the broader market is likely to continue since there is more scope for profit booking,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. It is important to understand that the market expects a positive Budget which is growth oriented and fiscally prudent with income tax reliefs for the middle class. Also the market expects status quo on the Long Term Capital Gains taxation. If there is any disappointment in these areas the market can react negatively,  Vijayakumar said.Mandar Bhojane, Research Analyst at Choice Broking, said,  The 24,400 level acts as immediate support; if broken, it could further correct to 24,200 and 24,000 in the coming days.

These startups aim to exploit the growing fashion business, which is currently the second-largest selling category in India's e-commerce industry after electronics and smartphones. ","Quick commerce platforms like Zomato’s Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart are in advanced talks with leading apparel and shoe manufacturers like Arvind Fashions, Fabindia, Woodland and Puma to sell their products to capitalise on a large section of consumers in top 15 cities moving to buy products other than groceries through quick commerce, multiple industry executives said.Fabindia has already finalised terms with Instamart whereby a tenth of the unsold stock will be taken back by the apparel manufacturer, and there will be a no-return policy for consumers. Others like Woodland are negotiating for store-return.Quick commerce firms currently do not have any return policy for products sold through their platform. These startups are hoping to exploit the growing fashion business, which is currently the second-largest selling category in India's e-commerce industry after electronics and smartphones, accounting for around 20-25% of sales. Quick commerce companies are also foraying into electronics and smartphones as ET recently reported.An executive said Arvind Fashions, which sells brands like Arrow, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and US Polo Assn, is in talks to sell innerwear and accessories like socks and belts through quick commerce. Puma, which sold jerseys during IPL through Zepto, is likely to expand the partnership to other products, he said. Currently, at the most, these platforms refund money for products with manufacturing defects. Quick commerce firms are also negotiating to link retail store inventory across locations on their platforms to offer a wider product assortment and avoid the logistical challenge of keeping entire stocks in dark stores since apparel would occupy much more space due to variety, sizes and fits. Such deliveries may also take longer than 10-15 minutes as is the norm currently with quick commerce, executives said.However, basic and fast-selling products like innerwear, socks, belts, white shirts, solid colour t-shirts, kurta, black trousers, blue jeans, black formal shoes, school shoes, clogs, home slippers or walking sneakers would be stocked in dark stores so they can be delivered in 10-15 minutes, the executives said.Woodland India chief executive Harkirat Singh said consumers are increasingly showing a propensity for instant delivery, and quick commerce can become big in fashion as well with already 30% of the company’s sales coming from e-commerce.In fact, the quick commerce platforms have recently made a soft-launch of fashion products. Swiggy Instamart is selling innerwear and basic colour t-shirts of Jockey and Adidas, while Blinkit is selling t-shirt, innerwear, track pants, some footwear, ethnic wear of Jockey, Pepe, Adidas and Manyavar. Zepto too has started selling Adidas and Jockey products. There is no return on these products. Anupam Bansal, director, retail, at shoemaker Liberty said the company plans to sell basic products and not fashion wear through quick commerce, that too only on pre-paid mode to ensure chances of return are low. “Fulfilment would be a challenge because at the end of the day, the fulfilment is happening either through the existing store network where they use only their pickup points, or they will invest in their warehouses to be able to do that commitment of 10 minutes which in the footwear industry is slightly more complicated. So, we want to sell very small merchandise like school shoes, chappals and basic shoes,” he said.Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto, Fabindia, Arvind Fashions and Puma didn’t respond to ET’s email queries till filing of this story. Even in grocery and fast-moving consumer goods categories, quick commerce has become the fastest growing channel for large companies like Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Nestle, Parle Products and Adani Wilmar, accounting for 30-35% of their total e-commerce sales in FY24.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/services/retail/quick-fashion-on-quick-commerce-instamart-blinkit-in-talks-with-top-apparel-brands/articleshow/111866284.cms

The negative divergence and crossover on the momentum indicator indicates that the weakness can continue.

ITC,2024-07-15T09:35:00+05:30,Nikhil Agarwal,Budget and stock markets: How Nifty may behave and 50 stock ideas," Sensex and Nifty rose 5% last month, with markets largely flat pre-Budget. Historically, Nifty shows -0.3% pre-Budget and -0.5% post. Post-Budget, Nifty sees 5.7% average gain in one month.","With the equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty having already jumped over 5% in the last month, a further run-up in share prices looks as the market has generally stayed flat one week before the Budget.An analysis of the Nifty performance one week before the Budget and one week after D-Day shows that the index has given an average return of -0.3% and -0.5%, respectively.However, the post-budget rally has been significant as Nifty has given an average return of 5.7% in one month after the Budget in the last 10 years. 111743354In the post-Budget period, sectors like materials, industrials, staples, and energy have outperformed. Going into the Budget, we expect Staples & Autos (potential consumption boost) & capex facing sectors such as Mortgage/Power financiers/Industrials/Cement/Metals to benefit; we are cautious on financial intermediaries,  said Amish Shah of BofA Securities.When Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the Budget on July 23, the new government is anticipated to increase welfare spending but not pivot entirely from its current economic policies of prudential fiscal discipline.A section of the market is expecting the Budget to use its extra revenues to boost consumption, especially rural consumption through a combination of both personal tax cuts and redistribution. We think the market is likely to be disappointed on this front. Tax cuts really do not help if they happen, they are likely to be quite small and redistribution is very unlikely since it is against the BJP's policy. We believe spending will focus on infrastructure (physical and social) and, therefore, will not be a direct boost to consumption. The government has already committed itself to a larger build of homes for poor people,  Morgan Stanley said.Axis Securities expects the government to continue with the capex plan announced in the Interim Budget, pegged at Rs 11.1 lakh crore. Its unwavering focus on roads, power, urban development, and railways will create key long-term economic multipliers. In a significant development for the railways, the government has announced higher capital outlays of Rs 2.55 lakh crore for the segment, which will notably boost railway infrastructure moving forward. Moreover, the scope of existing PLI schemes is likely to broaden to more sectors capable of generating more employment,  Axis said.In addition to the focus on an investment-led push to the economy, measures to boost the rural economy could also be on the agenda. The government has already increased allocation to MNREGA by 43% in the Interim Budget. Now, it may either look to increase the installment amount under the PM Kisan Nidhi Scheme as an alternative to guaranteeing the MSP for all crops. It may also look to increase rural housing credit subsidy, provide women & child SOPs (interim relief to boost consumption), give job guarantees through various skill development schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna, giving the impression that the government is taking care of roti, kapda, makan,  Sharekhan said.Here are key stock ideas from top brokerages:Sharekhan:FMCG: Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Dabur India, Emami.Auto: Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, M&M, Tata Motors.Infrastructure/Power/Capital Goods: UltraTech, L&T, PNC Infratech, NTPC, Power Grid, Coal India, VA Tech Wabag, DEE Development, Triveni Turbines, Supreme Industries, Tata Power and CESC.Defence: HAL, BEL, Bharat ForgeDiscretionary consumption and real estate: Samhi Hotels, Chalet Hotels, Wonderla Holidays, DLF, Sunteck Realty, Arvind Smart, ABDL.Financials: SBI, Bank of India, PNB, LIC Housing, Canfin Homes, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Lombard.Axis Securities:Hero Motocorp, Ultratech Cement, Nestle, NTPC, Praj Industries, Inox Wind, J Kumar Infra, Ahluwalia Contracts, V-Mart, M&M, Power Grid, Va Tech Wabag, Bharat Electronics and Sarvotech power.Choice Broking:Mahindra Lifespace Developers, Bharat Dynamics Limited, Bharat Electronics Limited and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

IT is currently outshining both BankNifty and Financial indices. However, the extremely high disparity between Nifty’s price and its average, coupled with the looming budget, suggests an imminent time-corrective phase. In scenarios where the support base is rising, and our customised breadth is improving, any retracement is likely to be brief. Thus, seizing breakout opportunities can yield substantial rewards. Revised support for Nifty is seen at around 24,200.What should investors do?The ratio of Nifty Oil & Gas vs Nifty is attempting to break above the February peak. Should this be confirmed, it will signal a continuation of momentum in oil & gas stocks, with ONGC and Gail expected to stand out for a potential rally of 10-12%.

On the daily scale, its average directional index (ADX) indicator has been trending well above 25 level, which is a good sign of retention of trend strength. Therefore, the 5-day EMA support (24,320) is the immediate level to gauge any loss in the ongoing momentum; and the 20-day EMA level (23,996), is a crucial point for determining trend change in case of corrective action. With no signs of any price and indicator divergence or reversal, we expect this gradual up-move to stretch towards 24,780, followed by 24,965 in the coming weeks.What should investors do?Participants may opt for taking some part of their profits after the rally from the election day lows, especially from stocks that have had extended rallies. Top bullish picks include Reliance, SBI, HDFC Life, Crompton Greaves, Vedanta, Indraprastha Gas, BPCL, Dalmia Bharat, and Naukri.ARPAN SHAH, ANALYST, MONARCH NETWORTH CAPITALWhere is the Nifty headed this week?Traders can expect volatility at 24,000-25,000 in benchmark Nifty. Bank Nifty is trading in the range of 51,800-52,800, and a breakout from this zone will provide a trending move in that direction. What should investors do? The Nifty IT index has given a fresh breakout, and any dip in heavyweights TCS and HCL Tech is a buying opportunity. Defensive stocks like ITC and HUL have also given fresh breakouts, and they can be added even at current levels. Auto stocks are showing signs of profit booking at higher levels, and stocks like M&M and Bajaj Auto are selling on the rise. In banking, HDFC Bank has corrected sharply from its recent high, and it’s a buy at the current level. RBL Bank is a short sell idea.

The positive global cue is the decline in inflation in the US by 0.1% in June triggering hopes of a rate cut by the Fed in September for which the market indicates a 90% probability. The positive domestic cue is the better than expected numbers from TCS and positive management commentary which can lift most IT stocks,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.Deven Mehata, Research Analyst at Choice Broking, said,  Nifty can find support at 24,300 followed by 24,200 and 24,150.

In the last two years, more than 60% of launches by large FMCG companies have been in the premium segment.","NEW DELHI: Consumer goods companies are launching low-unit packs and stepping up distribution to and stocking of kirana stores in the hinterland as they shift attention back to rural India, said executives. This is in sharp contrast to the last two years, when fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies such as ITC, Dabur, Marico, Britannia, Parle Products, Emami and Hindustan Unilever had been focused mainly on premiumisation with demand turning sluggish in villages as the rise in prices of daily essentials, vegetables and fuel had forced consumers to cut down on spending. In the last two years, more than 60% of launches by large FMCG companies have been in the premium segment.The companies are also investing in “consumer activation” efforts to increase engagement with rural buyers, the executives said. Apart from the expectations of an above-normal monsoon that could bolster farm incomes, companies are expecting policy measures in the July 23 budget to strengthen the revival of demand in rural India.Dabur, maker of Real juice and Vatika shampoo, is adding close to 100,000 villages in the current fiscal year to the 122,000 it served in FY24.Aspirational Rural ShoppersThe company is pushing Rs 10 packs across its portfolio of hair oils, shampoos and juices “to reap the benefits of improvement in rural consumer sentiment”, said Mohit Malhotra, chief executive of Dabur, which derives 48% of its Rs 9,100 crore annual sales from rural markets. “Alongside, we are expanding our product basket in rural markets with newer, affordable and rural-specific packs to push demand, and investing in consumer activations in the hinterland.”111669823Marico and Dabur had, in their June quarter pre-earnings updates, noted sequential improvement in rural demand in the preceding two quarters. They forecast similar growth going forward, aided by the June-September monsoon and anticipated budget steps aimed at greater rural employment and increasing farmers’ incomes.“The premium segment led to post-pandemic recovery in consumption. However, most categories are now witnessing a revival in the mass segment,” said Anand Ramanathan, partner, consumer products and retail at Deloitte India. “The budget will be an excellent opportunity to add momentum to revival of the mass segment. A normal monsoon, festival season and replacement demand will help drive volumes beyond urban markets to rural and semi-urban centres.” Demand from villages is crucial for overall growth of the FMCG sector, with well over a third of the annual sales of large companies dependent on the hinterland.“Rural growth is where the volumes come from, and that’s where we can grow the base,” said Mayank Shah, vice president at biscuits and snacks maker Parle Products. The company is pushing low-unit packs of even premium brands such as Milano and Hide & Seek. For example, in urban markets, Milano is sold in packs priced at Rs 40, while it’s being rolled out in Rs 10 packs for rural consumers. Hide & Seek is sold in Rs 30 packs in cities and in smaller Rs 10 packs in villages.“This is because aspirational demand of rural consumers is changing very fast,” Shah said. “They also want to try premium brands but in lower-priced packs.”In the January-March period, rural consumption surpassed that in urban areas for the first time in five quarters, consumer intelligence firm NielsenIQ noted in a recent update. The June quarter reflected similar trends, executives said. NielsenIQ is expected to release June-quarter updates early next month.ITC is focused on driving lowunit packs and distribution-led penetration through rural stockists, said Sandeep Sule, divisional chief executive, trade marketing and distribution at the company which makes Sunfeast biscuits and Vivel soap.“We have enabled the sales force in rural markets with analytics support for accessibility and servicing, machine learning to drive distribution, end-to-end digital infrastructure and investments on consumer activation and merchandising across high potential rural markets,” Sule said. Companies are pushing demand even in villages that have a population below 1,000, said an executive at the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation. This is happening both through direct distribution and indirectly --companies collaborating with wholesalers to reach remote villages, the person said.“All eyes are on the government’s initiatives to boost rural incomes in the upcoming budget,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a July 6 report. “Companies have been focusing on driving their core portfolios through various initiatives, like distribution expansion, product relaunches and step-up in marketing budgets.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/cons-products/fmcg/at-fmcg-box-office-rural-to-script-summer-blockbuster/articleshow/111669824.cms

The journey of 10,000 points was skewed by a handful of stocks --- five out of the 30 stocks contributed over half or 5,646 points while the top two contributors added nearly one-third to the rally.

ITC,2024-07-03T21:21:00+05:30,Ranjit Shinde,Valuations take centre stage as Sensex touches new peak,Majority of the Sensex constituents now trade above their respective long-term average valuations. It means investors need to be selective while accumulating blue chip names.  ,"ET Intelligence Group: Is the market getting overheated? Are the benchmark indices being overvalued? Questions such as these crop up each time the benchmark indices hit new milestones. After the S&P BSE Sensex touched 80,000 briefly on Wednesday, it is imperative to check whether valuations are becoming steep. One way to ascertain this is to compare the past valuations of the index and the index components with their current valuations. The exercise undertaken by ETIG reveals that the index valuations are still not on a higher side when compared with the past valuations. However, the majority of the Sensex constituents now trade above their respective long-term average valuations. It means investors need to be selective while accumulating blue chip stocks. Apart from sustained inflow of funds into equities, another reason for the upbeat sentiments is that analysts expect the earnings per share (EPS) of benchmark indices to continue to grow in double digits in the current fiscal year. For instance, Motilal Oswal Financial Services estimates Nifty 50 EPS to grow by 14% and 16% for FY25 and FY26.     111507488To understand the trend in valuations, trailing price-earnings (P/E) multiples were considered instead of forward P/Es to exclude the effect of any aggressive or overoptimistic earnings expectations, which tend to make future valuations attractive. The Sensex P/Es at every 5,000 points since the level of 50,000 (50k) were considered and compared with the current P/E level. In the case of banking and finance stocks, price-book (P/B) multiples were taken into account. According to the study, the current trailing Sensex P/E of 24.3 is among the lowest compared with the P/E levels when the index was at 50k, 55k, 60k, 70k, and 75k. At 65k, the Sensex P/E was a tad lower at 24.2. The highest P/E was 34.4 when the Sensex touched 50k in January 2021. It came down to 31.3 by the time the Sensex crossed 60k in September 2021 reflecting a pickup in the corporate earnings. In terms of valuations of individual constituents of the Sensex, 17 out of 30 companies currently trade above their three-year and five-year average valuations. In the case of banks and finance stocks, five out of the eight stocks including State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd bank trade above their long-term P/Bs. Companies including Reliance Industries, ITC, L&T, and Ultratech Cement among others trade above their long-term P/Es.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/valuations-take-centre-stage-as-sensex-touches-new-peak/articleshow/111465854.cms
