But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations.

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace.

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay. After this, he found the phones of the callers switched off for days on end.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ajmer/ajmer-bizman-duped-of-29l-in-bid-to-get-food-chain-franchise/articleshow/99948190.cms
itc,2023-05-03T08:15:00+05:30,Prafulla Marpakwar,MARATHA SATRAP PLOTS SUCCESSION,Mumbai: Sharad Pawarâs announcement of his stepping down as NCP president came less than a fortnight after his daughter Supriya Sule suggested there w.,"Mumbai: Sharad Pawarâs announcement of his stepping down as NCP president came less than a fortnight after his daughter Supriya Sule suggested there would be âtwo political explosions in 15 days, one in Delhi and the other in Maharashtraâ.His decision came at a time Pawar is seen as one of the leaders who could bring opposition parties together against BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections next year. A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms
itc,2023-05-10T08:08:00+05:30,Bhuvan Gupta,Can Axar-Kuldeep top Chennaiâs spin power?," Chennai: When in Chennai, you must beat the Chennai Super Kings at their own game."," Chennai: When in Chennai, you must beat the Chennai Super Kings at their own game. Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

itc,2023-04-29T02:12:00+05:30,Ishani Duttagupta,USCIS flags concern over multiple registrations by individual applicants for H-1B visas in FY2024,"US News: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024. As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said.

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split.

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi. He grew suspicious when the crooks kept asking for more money and failed to pay him the promised returns,â Pawar said. âThe fraudsters blocked his email ID, phone number and removed him from the social networking site group. He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution.

These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on. It will open for visitors once the exhibits are ready,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/science-city-likely-tobe-ready-before-july/articleshow/100025857.cms

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted.

Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday.

But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it.

Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

itc,2023-04-29T02:12:00+05:30,Ishani Duttagupta,USCIS flags concern over multiple registrations by individual applicants for H-1B visas in FY2024,"US News: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024. As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said.

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split.

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi. He grew suspicious when the crooks kept asking for more money and failed to pay him the promised returns,â Pawar said. âThe fraudsters blocked his email ID, phone number and removed him from the social networking site group. He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution.

These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on. It will open for visitors once the exhibits are ready,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/science-city-likely-tobe-ready-before-july/articleshow/100025857.cms

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted.

Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday.

But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it.

Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

itc,2023-04-29T02:12:00+05:30,Ishani Duttagupta,USCIS flags concern over multiple registrations by individual applicants for H-1B visas in FY2024,"US News: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024. As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said.

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split.

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi. He grew suspicious when the crooks kept asking for more money and failed to pay him the promised returns,â Pawar said. âThe fraudsters blocked his email ID, phone number and removed him from the social networking site group. He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution.

These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on. It will open for visitors once the exhibits are ready,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/science-city-likely-tobe-ready-before-july/articleshow/100025857.cms

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted.

Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday.

But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it.

Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

itc,2023-04-29T02:12:00+05:30,Ishani Duttagupta,USCIS flags concern over multiple registrations by individual applicants for H-1B visas in FY2024,"US News: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024. As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said.

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split.

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi. He grew suspicious when the crooks kept asking for more money and failed to pay him the promised returns,â Pawar said. âThe fraudsters blocked his email ID, phone number and removed him from the social networking site group. He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution.

These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on. It will open for visitors once the exhibits are ready,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/science-city-likely-tobe-ready-before-july/articleshow/100025857.cms

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted.

Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday.

But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it.

Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

itc,2023-04-29T02:12:00+05:30,Ishani Duttagupta,USCIS flags concern over multiple registrations by individual applicants for H-1B visas in FY2024,"US News: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024. As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said.

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split.

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi. He grew suspicious when the crooks kept asking for more money and failed to pay him the promised returns,â Pawar said. âThe fraudsters blocked his email ID, phone number and removed him from the social networking site group. He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution.

These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on. It will open for visitors once the exhibits are ready,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/science-city-likely-tobe-ready-before-july/articleshow/100025857.cms

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted.

Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday.

But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it.

Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

itc,2023-04-29T02:12:00+05:30,Ishani Duttagupta,USCIS flags concern over multiple registrations by individual applicants for H-1B visas in FY2024,"US News: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024. As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said.

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split.

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi. He grew suspicious when the crooks kept asking for more money and failed to pay him the promised returns,â Pawar said. âThe fraudsters blocked his email ID, phone number and removed him from the social networking site group. He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution.

These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on. It will open for visitors once the exhibits are ready,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/science-city-likely-tobe-ready-before-july/articleshow/100025857.cms

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted.

Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday.

But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it.

Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

itc,2023-04-29T02:12:00+05:30,Ishani Duttagupta,USCIS flags concern over multiple registrations by individual applicants for H-1B visas in FY2024,"US News: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024. As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said.

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split.

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi. He grew suspicious when the crooks kept asking for more money and failed to pay him the promised returns,â Pawar said. âThe fraudsters blocked his email ID, phone number and removed him from the social networking site group. He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

He then approached police.âIn the Khadak case, a software developer lost Rs 7.6 lakh in a similar way between April 20 and 25.Senior inspector Sangeeta Yadav on Tuesday said: âThe fraudsters sent the woman a text for a work from home job to review eateries.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it.

Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution.

These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed. All the facilities and are interconnected. Landscaping and infrastructure work has been going on. It will open for visitors once the exhibits are ready,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/science-city-likely-tobe-ready-before-july/articleshow/100025857.cms

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted.

Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits. The company will pay another 10,000 towards the complainant's litigation expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-packing-one-biscuit-less-city-court-fines-itc-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/103409661.cms

There were no injuries, and ","GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a flat in a highrise in the Supertech Icon society in Nyay Khand 1 of Indirapuram on Tuesday evening. There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames. It took them over one and a half hours to bring the fire under control because it surrounded the room, âpuja gharâ and kitchen,â he said.âAccording to an initial inquiry, a short circuit in the AC in the room started the fire. When it happened, Chandrashekhar was at his office while his wife had gone out for work with her children,â he said.As soon as the news of the fire spread, the maintenance staff disconnected the electricity to the tower. A security guard and some residents helped people on the 5th floor get out of their flats.âThe fire safety systems in the society were in working condition and sounded an alarm as soon as the fire broke out. The maintenance team tried to douse the flames using fire safety equipment on the society premises. After two fire brigades reached the spot, we completely extinguished the fire using water dispensers,â said the CFO.Ranjeet Kumar, a resident, said that all residents panicked after hearing about the fire. But the maintenance team, jointly with some residents, helped rescue everyone from the tower. âThe fire officials also reached and controlled the situation well,â he said.âIt was our responsibility to evacuate them safely. At least 20 staff members from the maintenance team and security guards evacuated people. With the electricity cut, we took them down via the stairs, the safest option,â he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/owners-away-short-circuit-leads-to-fire-in-ipuram-flat-doused-in-an-hour-a-half/articleshow/100146691.cms

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations.

The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers.

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

Later, they asked him to invest in pre-paid tasks with a promise of good returns. By April 17, the man ended up transferring Rs 8.55 lakh in nine instalments to four bank accounts in Delhi.

The victim lodged an FIR at Christian Ganj police station here on Monday.As per the FIR, the complainant, Jaikishan of Vaishali Nagar, was asked to pay the fees of license, registration and a no-objection certificate (NOC). He said he got a call from a man named Deepak Sharma telling him that the famous food chain company wanted to allot an outlet on franchise in Ajmer. Sharma sent him an online form to fill up, and Jaikishan happily filled it up, providing his PAN details and other documents in February. Jaikishan received in March an e-mail on the companyâs letterhead demanding that he submit copies of registry and other documents and pay Rs 2.65 lakh as GST.Jaikishan said he paid the money and then got a call on April 17 from someone identifying himself as Rahul, a representative of the company, and asking him to deposit Rs 7.75 lakh. Jaikishan said he was then asked to deposit a license fee and the fee for the NOC in April and that he thus paid a total of Rs 26 lakh for formalities till April 24. When Jaikishan asked for a meeting so that he could start the outlet of the food chain in Ajmer, he was on April 26 asked to pay Rs 40 lakh as deposit for the paperwork. But Jaikishan refused to pay.

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms

But the focus is on indigenisation and acquiring helicopters from within the country.""Our phasing out will start in two-three years but then we are hopeful we will start getting Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) so whatever gets phased out would get replaced in a reasonable timeframe by these LUHs,"" according to sources.""For the replacement of Cheetah and Chetaks in Army Aviation, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. We are progressing with the induction of Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and also looking at alternative replacement helicopters. For modernisation, we are looking to achieve an optimum balance of airlift and airstrike capability, hence we are also processing cases for additional LCH helicopters. Integration of HELINA missiles with ALH-WSI is also under progress,"" said a senior Army officer.The officer said that the modernization of Army Aviation began over two decades ago with the induction of multi-engine Dhruv helicopters. While ALH gained a reputation as a reliable tactical lift platform, the induction of Armed Helicopters in 2013, added firepower to our arsenal. Today's Army Aviation includes modern Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Mk-III, Weapon System Integrated (WSI) helicopter and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) and is set to add state-of-the-art Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) and Apache Attack Helicopters in its inventory.The transfer of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) has further enhanced surveillance as well as strike capability and transformed Army Aviation into a potent force multiplier capable of operating in Combined Combat Teams concept and of performing varied tasks across the varied terrain of our country, the officer added.In a supporting role, Army aviation has to be part of combat teams or combined arms teams and that is something that has started happening.Right from the planning stage, the Army aviation is involved. Unlike earlier when operations were first planned and then aviation used to come in a supportive role. This is that they have learned from wars and it has been already put in place, the officer said.Flight Safety is and will be the biggest concern for Aviation Operations as this profession remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and human error. We are implementing strong measures at a tri-service level to minimize such tragedies.Synchronisation of policies and Aviation Standards is being undertaken at the Tri-Service level. In addition, to prepare aviators for adverse weather situations and disorientation, training on motion simulators has been enhanced.

When he opened the packets, he found only 15 biscuits though the wrapper mentioned it was a 16-biscuit packet. There was no proper response when Dillibabu approached the store as well as the ITC for explanation.Dillibabu pointed out in his complaint that the cost of each biscuit is 75 paise.  He said in his complaint that ITC Limited manufactured close to 50 lakh packets a day and a back-of-the-envelope calculation would suggest the company cheated more than 29 lakh from the public every day.In its response, the firm argued that the said product was sold only based on the weight and not on number of biscuits. The advertised net weight of the biscuit packet was 76 grams. However, when the commission examined it, they found out that all unwrapped biscuit packets (containing 15 biscuits) were only 74 grams.ITC's counsel said the Legal Metrology Rules 2011 allowed a maximum permissible error of 4.5 grams in case of pre-packaged commodities. Not accepting it, the forum said such exemptions were applicable only for products which were volatile in nature or have the quality to get reduced due to weather conditions during transport. It is not applicable for items like biscuits which can't lose weight over time.The defence that the product was sold not in terms of 'numbers' but in terms of 'weight' was also turned down for the reason that the wrapper highlighted the number of biscuits and forum observed that potential buyers will be influenced on what information is printed on the wrapper or labels.On August 29, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Thiruvallur ordered ITC to not only pay 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service but also to discontinue the sales of the particular batch (No.0502C36) of biscuits.

There were no injuries, and fire officials said they suspect a short circuit in the AC led to the blaze.At the time, flat owner Chandrashekhar and his family had gone out for work. Chandrashekhar works with a pharma company in the city and lives with his wife and children in the flat on the 5th floor of Tower E.A video of the fire on social media shows flames and smoke engulfing at least two rooms of the flat. When the blaze reached the balcony, residents of a nearby tower saw it and alerted the society maintenance team and the fire department.Chief fire officer Rahul Pal said the fire broke out at 6.45pm on Tuesday, and residents informed them about it at 6.50pm. After that, three fire tenders reached the site to douse the flames.âA team of 15 fire officials reached and tried to douse the flames.

A packed Eden Gardens chanted âRinku Rinkuâ when Kolkata Knight Ridersâ acclaimed finisher Russell was still there at the crease.Singh, who had already caught the eyeballs by smashing five sixes in a row to seal an incredible victory over reigning champions Gujarat Titans earlier in the tournament, was again at it pulling off a dramatic five-wicket victory in a must-win game with a last-ball boundary against Punjab Kings.It was Russell himself who was all praise for the 25-year-oldâs effort. The West Indian brought a tricky chase under control hitting three sixes off Sam Curranâs penultimate over of the match. Needing six in the last over, Punjab left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh kept things tight giving away just four runs from five deliveries before running out Russell for 42 off 23 balls, ending the 54-run fifth-wicket stand with Rinku.âDefinitely in any other game, with any other batter Iâm not sure if I would have run (for that). Iâve never really done those things before. I would back myself to bat till the last delivery and get the job done,â Russell saidâBut when you have a batter like Rinku at the other end and who has been successful in the past few games for us, I was definitely confident,â Russell stated after the victory. âI have faith in him to finish it. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what heâs been doing. I have company at the back -end.âFormer India cricketer Mohammad Kaif was impressed with Rinkuâs confidence. âAn uncapped Indian player like Rinku Singh asking a finisher like Russell to come to the non-strikerâs end on the fifth ball of the over shows the confidence this player has in his game. This, for me, is a story of IPL,â Kaif said while commentating for the game.Russell felt Rinkuâs ability to stay calm in any situation works for him.âThe key for Rinku is heâs very calm. When you are a batter, you have to have an open mind and be relaxed. You canât expect a full pitch delivery every time. You have to expect all kinds of deliveries â a slower one, slower wide ball, a Yorker, a short one,â he said.âRinku gets into a position from where he can face any delivery and has a shot for it. His technique is very simple,â Russell added.The all-rounder, however, had a word of caution for Rinku. âNo matter how many people keep shouting âRussell, Russell, Russellâ, I always just stay humble. When you get swell-headed, thatâs when you lose it. Heâs a great guy, I love him like a brother and I hope he keeps doing what heâs doing,â Russell stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-have-faith-in-rinku-russell/articleshow/100116974.cms

Teams have learnt this the hard way, and the scenario will be no different for the Delhi Capitals, who have to win on Wednesday to stay in contention for a playoff berth. The pitch is likely to be sluggish and spinners are expected to rule the roost, which means DCâs frontline tweakers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel need to measure up against CSKâs spin troika of Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali and Maheesh Theekshana at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Kuldeep and Axar have had lukewarm success with the ball in the tournament so far, picking up eight and seven wickets respectively. But more than the dismissals, their ability to slow things down and keep the likes of Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad at bay when they come after them will be critical. Considering the conditions they will get here, especially if they end up bowling first, the visitors might be tempted to include a third spinner in the XI in the form of 26-year-old offie Lalit Yadav. While Axarâs bowling will be important, his role as a batter will also be extremely crucial. He is one player who can deal with spinners on these surfaces and DC can think of promoting him up the order. It will be interesting to see if CSK, who will look to close in on a top-two berth, will alter their arsenal in any way if they have to bowl second, when the dew could become a big factor. Batting coach Michael Hussey said the team management will certainly mull it over. The home team has missed the services of talismanic allrounder Ben Stokes for a major portion of the tourney as he was sidelined by a toe injury after playing just the first two games. Hussey confirmed that Stokes is now fit and available for selection, and has not been featuring in the playing XI for the last few games because of the nature of the surface and the corresponding team combination.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-axar-kuldeep-top-chennais-spin-power/articleshow/100116823.cms

The leg-spinner has kept aside the disappointment of not making it to the Test squad during Australiaâs tour of India earlier this year. He is not even thinking too far ahead about the ODI World Cup in October. The 31-year-old, who played for Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016 and 2017 and then for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, says he is having a good time in the company of his new teammates â Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin.Currently the finest Australian leg-spinner in the limited-over formats, Zampa sat down with TOI for a light-hearted chat where he talked about his experience in the IPL, his equation with fellow spinners, Chahal and Ashwin, his go-to delivery, and more. Excerpts:It is your fourth season in the IPL and first with the Royals. How has it been so far in Royals camp?I am enjoying it here. It has been a couple of years since I played the IPL, and my last season was in a bubble in 2020 in Dubai. So, itâs good to be back. It has been an epic competition this year, most of the games are high scoring and finishing close. The competition has been taken to a new level.There is a relaxed feeling here (in Royals camp). I feel there is a lot of trust in terms of everyoneâs preparation for the game. This franchise is in a good space and itâs not really an emotional roller-coaster like some franchises can be. We play well and deep breathe, we play poorly and deep breathe, trying to get better. As simple as that.Royals already have two star Indian spinners in Ashwin and Chahal in the squad. How difficult does it make for you to find a place in the playing XI?In 11 games, I have played four. Itâs obviously a balancing act trying to get three spinners in, but weâve shown that we can make it work. From my point of view, it is about preparing and getting ready. I have played enough cricket now to know what I need to do to sum up a match situation and play my role.It has been more than a month since the IPL started. Are you now friends with Ashwin and Chahal? Any notes shared on bowling, especially with Chahal who is also a leg-spinner?Three of us have played together before. The relationship was already there, so here at the Royals we have gotten along pretty naturally. We get great feedback from each other, there are a lot of cricket conversations around bowling and how to get better on different surfaces. I mean, these have happened over the last few years, not just the last month.The grounds here in India are very different from the ones you have in Australia. What changes do you make while bowling on the Indian wickets?I think Iâve played in India just as much as Iâve played in Australia. It feels like Australia play India every year and weâre here every year. So, I have experience and knowledge of these wickets here. My first couple of tours to India were the ones where I tried working out on things. Now when I am here, I have a gameplan and I stick to that. Wickets at home are a lot different. They bounce more and are faster. Here sometimes either we get a spinning wicket or the one which is low and slow.How different is IPL from BBL?BBL and IPL are a lot different. I mean BBL has gone through waves of success and failures and is still fighting its identity whereas IPL is an unbelievable competition, the feel is unreal, the quality of cricket (competition) is sometimes harder than international cricket.Playing at different venues here might benefit you in the ODI WC later this year in India. What do you think? No, I am not really thinking about the World Cup now. At that moment, itâs going to be a totally different format and we donât even know how the pitches are going to be at that time and at which venues we are going to play. So, itâs not even on my mind now.What is your go-to delivery when batters start dominating you?I bowl this delivery called the âsplittyâ. Itâs a split finger delivery which comes out a little bit slower.You were snubbed for the Test series in India earlier this yearâ¦Thatâs potentially they passed me by, to be honest. I really donât know. I made it obvious that I was disappointed to not play on that tour. I still feel I could have been a good option. But they saw it differently, and thatâs just how it panned out, unfortunately. And now I donât know what the future lies in that format for me.While growing up, which spinner had an influence on you?I watched a lot of Stuart McGill and Shane Warne. I had these two guys to look up to.Talking about Warne, do you think any other Australian can match his legacy?No. Definitely not. He changed the game, and it would never ever change as much as he changed it. He was a rockstar and a legend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/competition-in-ipl-is-at-times-harder-than-intl-cricket-zampa/articleshow/100087423.cms

The Sunrisers Hyderabad are lying at the bottom with just six points to their credit and the situation looks hopeless for the skipper.However, Markram is optimistic about good results in the remaining part of the ongoing IPL. The SRH skipper knows the daunting task ahead but keeps his composure as his side faces hosts Rajasthan Royals at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.âUnfortunately, we have not done it the way we would have liked it. There were a couple of very close defeats including the last one against KKR. We could not be able to cross the lines. We canât change what has happened so far. We still have five games, and we are hopeful of good results in those games,â said Markram during a pre-match press conference here on Saturday.The South African cricketer also hasnât lived up to his batting potential and failed to put up tall scores in the competition so far. Some of the leading batters of the side including Harry Brook, Mayank Agarwal, and Heinrich Klaasen couldnât rise to the occasion and were inconsistent in their form.âIt is not the ideal situation to be in when you are second from the bottom. We need to forget the past and focus on the remaining outings. The competition is stiff, and this is the toughest league. We have not been able to deliver despite trying hard. The positive part is we have been able to put up quite a strong fight in the last couple of matches. We are close but just couldnât deliver the knockout punch,â said Markram.The SRH team reached Jaipur early and saw the match when GT beat RR quite comfortably on Friday. Markram is hoping to capitalize on the lack of form of RR batters.âYeah, we landed yesterday. Obviously, guys go to their rooms and then do their own things to take a bit of off time. But I believe I donât watch too much of the game. It was kind of on in the background and we saw it. It was a low scoring game, but we saw with Gujarat innings when they added that itâs still a pitch that you can score runs on. So, weâre looking at it from that point of view. Weâll do some proper analysis tonight and then go tomorrow into the game. See exactly how the pitch played and. Hopefully from there we can. Select the team that hopefully can do it. Very well for us tomorrow,â added Markram.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/we-will-try-to-get-good-results-in-remaining-5-games-markram/articleshow/100045127.cms

This follows in the wake of the chapter on evolution being deleted from the NCERT textbook for Std X. Hundreds of members of the scientific community from across the country have written to NCERT to restore the chapter that was deleted as part of the rationalisation of textbooks during the pandemic, which continue to be used in the same form now. MANS has slammed the BJP-ruled central government for deleting the chapter, alleging that it does not want students to learn about scientific evolution. They said the party âwants students to believe in supernatural powers or religious concepts of creation, the basis of many blind faiths followed in society.â Through the campaign, the activists will distribute booklets in schools to students and teachers about evolution. MANS will also pitch for studying evolution to start from Std VII not directly in Std X. âWe plan to prepare audio-visual content to help students learn Darwinâs Theory and other concepts. We will also hold workshops for science teachers and prepare a network of speakers to visit schools and make presentations. While it is the governmentâs job to develop scientific temper among students through the education system, they are not doing so,â said MANS activist and son of Narendra Dabholkar, Hamid Dabholkar .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mans-to-bring-back-theory-of-evolution-for-students/articleshow/100026061.cms

Being constructed over 36,000 square metres area on 21 acre land near Moinul Haq Stadium at Rajendra Nagar, it is expected to promote and popularise science among the people as well as demonstrating the illustrious scientific development.State building construction departmentâs secretary Kumar Ravi said the civil work has been completed in all the galleries, learning suites, auditoriums, orientation hall and other supporting structures of science city. âThe furnishing work has been going on in full swing and is expected to be completed in the next couple of months,â he said.The G+1 building has four large galleries namely, âBasic Sciencesâ, âSpace and Astronomyâ, âSustainable Planetâ and âBody and Mindâ. The building will have one small gallery, which will be named âBe a Scientistâ. It will be the introductory gallery and give an overview of the science city. Besides, there will be four learning suites â maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym, where the visitors will observe and learn things.âThe galleries and learning suites will have various science exhibits and models. The concept designs of 243 exhibits have been prepared by the agency and approved by the science and technology department. Now, we will initiate the bidding process for the fabrication of selected exhibits. These exhibits include 2D and 3D, interactive, touch screens, experiments and holograms and even static models,â Ravi told TOI.The team, which prepared the exhibits, has studied five different science cities, including Kolkata, Montreal, Canada, Toronto and Boston. The exhibits are categorized into 57 sub-themes as per the galleries and learning suites, such as robotics, numbers (binary system), shapes and velocity in basic sciences.Similarly, in sustainable planet, the visitors will see models related to sub-themes like eco system, earth cycle, biodiversity, water cycle, monsoon, cyclone, flooding and landslide. Astronomical instruments and solar system in space and astronomy while human body, digestive system and respiratory system in body and mind. Learning suites will mostly comprise of working models.Ram Babu, executive engineer of building construction department, said apart from galleires and learning suites, the modern science city will have back-up house, multi-purpose hall, auditorium, souvenir shops, 4D gallery, exhibition hall. âA G+4 dormitory to accommodate 200 people is also constructed.

But his glittering 41-ball 75 in the previous match against the Punjab Kings would have dispelled doubts about the southpawâs form and his importance in the Mumbai Indians setup.The knock would also have done Ishanâs own confidence a world of good, and he acknowledges as much. âIt's very important when you are chasing such a big total. You need a good start. We scored 54 runs in the powerplay in the last game and have got over 50 runs in each game,â the 24-year-old from Jharkhand said ahead of Saturdayâs clash against the Chennai Super Kings.Losing early wickets can often subdue top-order players, but Ishan made it clear that it doesnât alter his approach as the goal is to make the most of the field restrictions. He explained: âIf we lose wickets early like we lost Rohit bhai (Rohit Sharma) the other day (against PBKS), we still have that intent of going after the bowlers. We donât want to let them dominate the game. That's the positive mindset we keep in every game so that we can call the shots from any situation.âA spin-friendly Chepauk pitch would make it critical for Ishan to try and do most of the heavy lifting on Saturday. âWe have played our matches so far on tracks very good for batting, but if it turns here, it's very important for the top-order batters to spend time in the middle, so that we don't put pressure on the ones who will come in to bat at No. 4, 5 and 6.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/being-fearless-the-key-for-ishan/articleshow/100025381.cms

The MoU was signed between Prof. Parameswar K Iyer, officiating director, IIT Guwahati and Manoj Raghavan, chief executive officer, and managing director of Tata Elxsi. Prof. Praveen Kumar of electronics and electrical engineering department of IIT-G said, âMost importantly, our collaborative work will help predict the failures in EVs before it actually happens. This is the broad idea and we have started working on it.â Raghavan told TOI that though switching over to electric mode has been slow in the country, gaining pace is just a matter of time. âOnce more options are available and prices come down, use of EVs will gain pace. Everything is going in the right direction. Itâs just a matter of time,â he said. He said efforts are on to use technology for maintenance and develop tools and technology for preventive maintenance.Raghavan felt that the fault analysis solution will be exemplary and show the way how industry-academia collaboration can bring together original thinking and application of the latest digital technologies to solve very specific industry needs from operators, OEMs and system suppliers in the transportation industry.Under the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021, the state government has planned to convert its existing public transport and government vehicles to electric vehicles by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tata-elxsi-iit-g-team-up-to-research-ev-fault-solutions/articleshow/100000665.cms

Konaraddi switched over from JD(S) to Congress in December 2021 and has since then been a Congress ticket aspirant. Youngster Vinod Asuti, who had given both Munenakoppa and Konaraddi a tough challenge in 2018, was eyeing a Congress ticket yet again, but was left disappointed. In spite of being a member of the Kuruba community, Asuti gained a fair bit of popularity across all communities because of his tireless work during the Covid pandemic in Navalgund taluk. Denial of ticket to Asuti triggered some confusion among the electorate, which is now likely to be a boon for JD(S) candidate and former minister KN Gaddi, who joined the party at the 11th hour before filing of nominations, after failing to secure a Congress ticket.Though a total of 13 candidates are in the fray from Navalgund, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the fight looks primarily between the BJP and Congress. However, there is a possibility that the JD(S) candidate may throw up quite a challenge for the two prime contenders by cashing in on the differences within the Congress and a perceived anti-incumbency against the BJP.If Asuti continues to maintain his distance from the Congress campaign, there are chances that the votes of the Kuruba community will be split and JD(S) candidate Gaddi could well be the direct beneficiary of that. A similar split in the Muslim vote, too, can benefit JD(S).In six out of the first eight elections since 1957, the Congress emerged victorious, except in 1972 and 1978 when NCO (National Congress-Organisation) and Congress(I) won, respectively.A major change came about in 1994, when KN Gaddi of KCP emerged victorious, defeating MK Kulkarni of Congress. Gaddi again won in 1999, but on a Congress ticket. He also went on to become a minister in the SM Krishna government.The BJP recorded its first win in Navalgund in 2004, when its candidate RB Shiriyannavar defeated Gaddi of the Congress. The trend continued as Munenakoppa won the seat in 2008, once again for the BJP, with Gaddi yet again fighting as a Congress candidate.JD(S) fielded a candidate form this constituency for the first time in 1999, with NH Konaraddi fighting the elections on a JD(S) ticket. In 2004 and 2008, too, he was the JD(S) candidate, though he lost on all those occasions. He tasted success for the first time as a JD(S) candidate in 2013, when he staved off the challenge from Munenakoppa of BJP and Gaddi of Congress.However, the combined vote share of the BJP and KJP candidates was more than the votes polled by NH Konaraddi.In the 2018 polls, BJPâs Munenakoppa defeated Konaraddi with a margin of more than 20,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Basavaraj Bommaiâs cabinet.As May 10 approaches, all three major parties are hopeful of an impressive showing, though a lot will depend upon the extent to which votes of the various communities, including minorities, are split. By all means, it looks like Navalgund is headed for a keen contest.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/prime-contenders-look-to-make-the-most-of-split-in-votes-in-navalgund/articleshow/100000298.cms

A four-time chief minister who also served as union defence and agriculture minister, Pawar was instrumental in stitching together the unlikely coalition of NCP, Congress and their ideological foe Shiv Sena to form the MVA government after the 2019 assembly elections.After the customary welcome speeches at the book release function at the Y B Chavan Centre on Tuesday, Pawar in his speech post-noon made some remarks about his nearly six-decades-long political journey and then said it was necessary to take a step back. He said after a long period of public life from May 1960 to 2023, he intended to do âmore work in the field of education, agriculture and cooperation, sports and culture. I will pay attention to issues related to youths, students, workers, Dalits, tribals and weaker section of societyâ. He said he was setting up a party committee to be led by his colleague Praful Patel to decide on the election of a new president. âNow I have three years in the Rajya Sabha. I am not keen on taking up any fresh responsibility. I want to focus on issues related to Maharashtra,â he said. NCP leaders then climbed on to the dais in order to plead with him to relent. In turns, Praful Patel, Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil, Dhananjay Munde, Chhagan Bhujbal, Sunil Tatkare and over a dozen senior legislators and MPs asked him to stay on, saying that they would not accept his resignation and that the party meant little without him at the helm.Even as pressure was mounting on the octogenarian leader, Ajit Pawar justified the NCP presidentâs decision, saying it was high time the party got a new leadership. âWith the changing political situation, we must take new decisions. Most of the political parties have new leaders. I do not think Sharad Pawar will reconsider his decision,â Ajit Pawar said. For two hours, NCP leaders and activists surrounded Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre and asked him to change his mind. Pawar, though, sat silently with his wife Pratibha by his side. His daughter and MP Supriya Sule sat among party leaders and activists. Praful Patel finally said, at 2.45pm, that activists needed to vacate the auditorium as Pawar had not had his lunch. âSharad Pawar is old, he must follow a certain discipline about food. It will not be good if skips his lunch,â Patel said.Pawar left subsequently for his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai but the activists still squatted inside the Y B Chavan Centre. It was soon decided that a team of NCP leaders would be deputed to meet him post-lunch and talk to him. Ajit Pawar, accompanied by NCP netas Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and Supriya Sule, later met Pawar at his residence. Around 6pm, Ajit Pawar returned to the Y B Chavan Centre to brief party activists about the meeting with the NCP president.âWe had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar. We explained to him the sentiments of people. He has sought 2-3 daysâ time for taking a decision on his resignation. All workers must immediately leave the Y B Chavan Centre, and no one should quit official posts or resort to agitation,â Ajit said. Following Ajit Pawarâs statement, party workers finally left the premises, ending a day filled with political drama.

RCB have struggled to maintain momentum provided by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell, who have done all the scoring in the eight games so far.With most teams bunched up closely in the standings, the margin for errors has reduced in the second half of the competition. Kohli, du Plessis and Maxwell canât be expected to do the job in every game and it is high time the likes of Mahipal Lomror, Shahbaz Ahmed and Dinesh Karthik step up.The fielding and catching too needs to improve, something which was pointed by Kohli himself after the loss to KKR. The former India captain will continue to lead the side unless du Plessis, who has been used as an âImpact Playerâ, regains full fitness.Mohammad Siraj has been the stand out bowler for RCB and he needs support from the other fast bowlers. Harshal Patel is tasked with bowling the tough overs but he would want to bring down his economy rate from 9.94.LSG, on the other hand, head into the game after a thumping victory against Punjab Kings. The batting performance against Punjab was a testament to the firepower they posses. No total is safe when Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran get going.Skipper K L Rahul, however, will be the feeling heat and would want to make a statement at LSGâs home ground. The pitch in Lucknow has been bit of a letdown and worked against the strengths of the home team.Offered a batting beauty in Mohali, LSG batters went on the rampage but they have struggled due to the slow nature of the surface here. Rahul and Co. would, however, be expected to put up a much better show than what they managed in their previous home game as they failed to chase 136 from a commanding position.

itc,2023-04-29T02:12:00+05:30,Ishani Duttagupta,USCIS flags concern over multiple registrations by individual applicants for H-1B visas in FY2024,"US News: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Friday, released the much awaited figures of H-1B visa registrations for the financial year 2024. As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS had received enough electronic registrations to reach the FY 2024 H-1B cap.As had been predicted by several immigration experts, during the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. A whopping 780,884 registrations were received for H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 annually, compared with 483,927 for FY 2023.In its announcement on Friday, USCIS has flagged the fact that there have been a large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple registrations - much larger than in previous years â raising serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. âThis may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition,â the announcement said.The USCIS announcement goes further to remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct; the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and the registrant, or the organisation on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.âIf USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted,â the announcement warns. Further, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. USCIS has also announced that it is working on an upcoming H-1B modernisation rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.Immigration experts and lawyers have, in fact, been pointing out the need for an overhaul of the USCIS rule allowing multiple registrations for H-1B visas by individual applicants. âDuplicate registrations means either a group of employers filing multiple coordinated registrations for same employee or the employee approaching numerous companies to submit H-1B registration on his/her behalf,â explains says Manjunath Gokare, an immigration lawyer based in Atlanta, Georgia. He feels that the only logical explanation for the huge number of filings this year is duplicate registrations. âThe practice of duplicate registrations reduces the chances of selection collectively for all. This practice disadvantages everyone,â he adds.In a closed group of users on a social media platform, that was accessed by the Times of India, a large community of Indians have been discussing issues related to H-1B registrations for FY 2024, for the last few weeks. Many of them are IT professionals based in India and several are Indian students in the US, who are currently on the optional practical training period, but looking to switch to the H-1B work visas that will allow them to remain in the US. While many of the members of this group have been selected in the H-1B visa lottery, they have causes for worry. In fact, several questions are being raised about consulting companies, which had registered for the H-1B lottery for some of these applicants and now the applicants are not sure whether the consultancies are genuine employers or if they are fraudulent entities. Also on their minds is the worry about what their fate will be if their H-1B application comes under the scanner of the USCIS. This forum, like many others, is a platform largely to share information about consulting companies that have been filing applications for thousands of Indians who are hopeful of getting selected through the H-1B lottery.As pointed out by the USCIS on Friday, most immigration lawyers and experts, too, feel that there are several consultancies which file multiple coordinated registrations for the same beneficiary through different companies. Many of these consultancies have multiple offices in the US and in India. âEssentially, companies collude with each other to maximise the chances of their resource getting through the lottery. Once the registration selections are announced these companies strategize which company will file the H-1B and for which resource,â says Gokare. He adds that often employees approach multiple consulting companies and these companies may file the registration unaware that some other employer may also be submitting the registration for same employee. The H-1B electronic registration process involves prospective petitioners first registering and paying the fee for each prospective beneficiary. Under this process, prospective petitioners, and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker, according to USCIS.Gokare feels that though USCIS does provide a means to check for duplicate registration, it is not clear how effective this is to prevent fraudulent practices. âIt is evident that the current H-1B registration process, although well intentioned, is not working to everyoneâs benefit. As such, changes are necessary for the H-1B registration process to be effective,â he says. One of the steps suggested by him is a significant increase in the registration fee; which will disincentivise the practice of duplicate registrations. âUSCIS should collect a portion of eventual H-1B filing fees at the registration stage, which could then be adjusted if the case gets filed. So, if there are frivolous duplicate filings that get selected but are not filed by employers, there is a financial implication for such filers,â he adds.Employers of several Indian students, who are in the US on OPT visas, had registered for H-1B visas for them. Thousands of them have been disappointed because they were not selected in the lottery for FY2024. Many are running out of time and will have to leave the US soon when their OPT period ends and they go out of visa status. âDuplicate registrations for the same candidate by consultancies who are gaming the H-1B lottery system is a big problem. USCIS is aware of the issue with consultancies issuing fake offer letters; individuals paying consultancies for H-1B filing and petition fees instead of the employer; and no genuine clients or projects available at the time of registering for the lottery; but turns a blind eye,â an Indian student who has completed his masters degree from an US university, but did not want to be named, told the Times of India. He is now employed with an analytics firm in Chicago; but was not lucky in the H-1B lottery, despite support from his employer.

But the sales of hard liquor have remained stagnant. A total of 27,50,334 boxes of liquor were sold during the financial year that ended on March 31, while it was 27,07,465 boxes in 2021-22. In 2020-21, 15.94 lakh boxes of beer were sold, and the liquor sale was recorded at 22.79 lakh boxes. In 2015-16, Dakshina Kannada alone used to sell 19.6 lakh boxes of beer.âEver since the pandemic struck, there have been few takers for beer. They took a beer break to keep away from Covid-19. However, sales are up in the 2022â23 fiscal year. In fact, there is a short supply of beer not just in Dakshina Kannada, but across the state,â said a senior excise official.Another official added that beer sales have gone up in the past six months due to rising temperatures. âMillennials prefer beer over liquor. There are others who aslo have ditched liquor and switched to beer due to the sizzling summer this year,â the official said. Sources also pointed out that in order to stop the distribution of liquor ahead of assembly polls, the excise department has limited the sale by vendors. For example, if a liquor shop sold 100 boxes of beer during the same month last year, it is allowed to lift only an additional 20% of boxes this time. The demand for extra liquor/ beer is discouraged, they said. According to liquor vendors, they had a tough time selling beer as it has a maximum shelf life of six months. âCurrently, there is a demand for beer but not much stock of certain beer brands is available. Besides this, liquor shops used to give discounts or offers on beer, and it has stopped with sales going upward,â shared a liquor vendor.Bindushree P, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dakshina Kannada, was not available for comments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/beer-sales-head-north-in-dk-as-covid-19-eases/articleshow/99802030.cms
