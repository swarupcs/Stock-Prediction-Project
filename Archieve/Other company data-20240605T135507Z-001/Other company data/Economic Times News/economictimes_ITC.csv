On the other hand, plastic recyclers and innovative packaging companies such as Ganesh, EPL, Uflex and ITC, which can provide solutions for making plastic recyclable, develop products using post-consumer recycled material (PCR), and offer economical alternatives to plastics, will be the key beneficiaries of the roll-out of the new rules.India will implement the mandatory norms for the recycling and reuse of recycled content for producers, importers and brand-owners of plastic packaging in a phased manner from FY2025. The new rules are a part of the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules 2022 (PWM), which aim to boost secondary plastic markets by enacting new norms to create a circular plastic economy and address the rising concerns about plastic pollution.Kotak sees Colgate and Nestle getting impacted the most among companies in its coverage as the regulations will have a higher impact on the food and oral care segment and products that require the use of transparent packaging which requires higher-quality of recycled plastic packaging material. This trades at a 40-50% premium to virgin plastic.The packaging costs of companies in the consumer staples universe are in the range of 5-13% of their revenues with a high exposure to plastic given its unique value proposition.

ITC,2024-05-05T06:00:00+05:30,Writankar Mukherjee and Sagar Malviya,From powders to liquids: Competition heats up in liquid cleaners market in India,"India's market sees a surge in liquid cleaners' popularity, driven by ecommerce growth and competition among top players like HUL, ITC, and Colgate. The trend towards premium, differentiated products reflects changing consumer preferences and aspirations.","Kolkata|Mumbai: Powders and bars are passe - liquids are cleaning up the market. India is showing a distinct shift in consumption habits, with liquid products in soaps, detergents and dish cleaners being adopted readily, executives at top companies said. Aided by the growth in ecommerce, competition in liquids cleaners is heating up with the entry of multiple new players - not just in cities but in smaller towns too.According to a recent report by researcher Kantar, just two categories in the home and personal care segment added more than 10 million new consumers in 2023, both in the liquid format. Liquid fabric softeners and washes added 14 million and 13.1 million new users, respectively. Against the overall fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market growth of 5%, these segments grew 13% and 20% each, Kantar estimated.Sales of such products have accelerated at a faster pace than solids and powders. Hindustan Unilever (HUL), ITC and Colgate-Palmolive India are expanding their liquid products portfolio. 109846047This is across brands and price points, making liquid soaps and washes the next hotspot.Everyone’s vying for a piece of the pie — startups as well as established brands such as Mamaearth, Wow, Safewash, Santoor and Wipro Consumer Care’s Chandrika, Godrej Fab and several other labels of ecommerce majors and retailers.Sameer Satpathy, divisional chief executive of personal care products at ITC, said the shift reflects the needs of an aspirational society looking for premium products that are unique and differentiated. “This trend is further fuelled by the penetration of ecommerce and digital acceleration,” he said.HUL chief executive and managing director Rohit Jawa told analysts last month that there was a macro-secular trend of consumers moving toward liquids across categories. He said there is more competition now from tier II brands, especially in fabric wash liquids. That market has now opened up and become sizable, with many global and local players having entered, he said.Jawa said HUL has already built a liquids business of almost Rs 4,000 crore across categories and relaunched liquid Surf Excel and Vim, leading to higher growth last fiscal.ITC has been betting on labels such as Fiama, Dermafique, Savlon and Nimwash to expand its liquids play. Analysts believe Colgate-Palmolive plans to expand the Palmolive brand much faster than its oral care business, with a focus on products such as body wash.The growth rate for liquid products is upwards of 50-60%, compared with the single-digit pace of growth in powders and bars. Lower penetration of liquid products has a part to play. As Jawa pointed out, the reach of bodywashes is still under 2%. This compares with 90-95% for soaps.Supermarkets are also said to be driving the shift to liquids. Reliance Retail sells more machine wash liquids than powders, which is part of the “bullish, growing and premiumising” of supermarkets in India, chief executive for the grocery business, Damodar Mall, posted on X in January.

In an interview to PTI, Samir shared the expansion plans of Fortune Hotels, which has just opened its first international hotel -- Fortune Resort & Wellness Spa Bhaktapur -- in Nepal.  He described it as a significant milestone in the company's  beyond borders  expansion strategy, envisioning its presence in South Asia and proximal markets.   Following on the heels of this prestigious opening, we are poised to open at least four to six more hotels in the first half of the fiscal year in unique destinations like Kevadia (Ekta Nagar, Gujarat), Candolim (Goa), Palampur (Himachal Pradesh), and a beach resort in Chennai amongst others and an equal number in H2 (second half: October-March),  Samir said.   This pace aligns with our goal of establishing a new hotel almost every month in this fiscal year, marking significant progress towards our expansion targets,  he added.  Elaborating on the challenges for India's hospitality sector, Samir said economic uncertainties, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, geo-political tensions, and global economic downturns, can impact travel demand and consumer spending, posing challenges for hotels in terms of revenue management, occupancy rates, and profitability.

The 30-share BSE Sensex rallied 941.12 points or 1.28 per cent to finish at 74,671.28. During the day, it zoomed 990.99 points or 1.34 per cent to 74,721.15.

Markets witnessed phenomenal buying support as Sensex quickly moved towards the crucial 75K mark after investors cheered strong corporate earnings from select frontline banking and cement companies, indicating their smooth sailing despite the global vagaries.   Optimism prevailed from the start of the trading session as cooling of US bond yields and letdown in the Middle East conflict coupled with a drop in crude oil prices generated a lot of enthusiasm amongst the investors,  Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, said.  The two-day Fed's monetary policy meeting starting Tuesday will be closely watched by global investors, although markets don't expect any change in the policy outcome, he added.  From the Sensex basket, ICICI Bank climbed nearly 5 per cent after the company on Saturday said its March quarter consolidated net profit grew 18.5 per cent to Rs 11,672 crore, helped by lower provisions.  State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank, UltraTech Cement, Axis Bank, NTPC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank and Sun Pharma were the other major gainers.  HCL Technologies tanked nearly 6 per cent after the company reported a flat year-on-year growth in net profit in the March quarter at Rs 3,986 crore.  ITC, Wipro and Bajaj Finserv were the other laggards.  In the broader market, the BSE midcap gauge jumped 0.79 per cent and smallcap index advanced 0.07 per cent.   The Indian benchmark indexes rebounded, aided by an upbeat in US tech quarter earnings and a drop in US 10-year yield. Domestically, the Bank Nifty outperformed, driven by its strong performance in the fourth quarter. An ease in the Middle East tensions, coupled with stable earnings, is expected to maintain positive market sentiment,  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.  Indian markets opened in the green following positive Asian markets, said Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.  Traders are awaiting the US Fed's policy meeting decision this week post hotter-than-expected inflation print. Traders were seen piling up positions in the banking sector's stocks, Solanki added.

ITC,2024-04-28T15:23:00+05:30,Navdeep Singh,Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide stock action on Monday,"Domestic benchmark equity indices experienced a decline on Friday, primarily due to weakness in the financial sector. However, these losses did not overshadow the weekly gains, which were fueled by a post-results rally in key index constituents and reduced concerns regarding the Middle East.","Domestic benchmark equity indices experienced a decline on Friday, primarily due to weakness in the financial sector. However, these losses did not overshadow the weekly gains, which were fueled by a post-results rally in key index constituents and reduced concerns regarding the Middle East.The NSE Nifty 50 was down 0.67% to 22,420, on the day, while the S&P BSE Sensex shed 0.82% to 73,730. Both the indexes snapped a five-day winning streak. However, for the week, the Nifty 50 and Sensex gained about 1.25% and 1%, respectively.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: The Nifty witnessed selling pressure throughout the day and closed weak for the day down ~120 points. On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty has faced selling pressure from the resistance zone of 22560 – 22625. Until this zone is not taken out decisively, we can expect the consolidation to continue. On the downside, crucial support is now placed at 22240 – 22200 where support parameters in the form of the 40-day moving average and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from 21777 – 22626 is placed,  said Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Nifty remained under selling pressure throughout the session as the index failed to sustain above the crucial level of 22500. On the daily chart, a dark cloud cover pattern is observed, indicating a potential bearish reversal. Immediate support is situated at 22300, below which the Nifty could extend its losses towards 22000. On the other hand, the level of 22500 might act as a technical resistance for the Nifty. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday's action:US Market Close HigherUS stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq registered their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2023. Benchmark S&P 500 snapped three weeks of losses, while the Nasdaq ended four straight weeks of declines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.40%, the S&P 500 gained 1.02% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.03%.European Shares Notch 1.8% Weekly GainThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 1.2% higher, notching up a weekly gain of 1.8%, its biggest since late January.The basket of STOXX 600 banks touched a nine-month high, aided by a 6.1% jump in NatWest after the British bank's first-quarter results.Tech View: Dark cloud cover candlestickNifty ended 150 points lower on Friday to form a dark cloud cover candlestick on the daily chart while the weekly one saw a high wave type candle suggesting consolidation in the near term.The short-term trend of Nifty seems to have reversed down after a reasonable rise from the lows. Immediate support is placed at 22300 and the weakness below this support could trigger more declines ahead. Immediate resistance is at 22625 levels, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.Stocks showing bullish bias:Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of HUDCO, Westlife Foodworld, Tech Mahindra, DCM Shriram, Lemon Tree Hotels, and Bank of Maharashtra among others.The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.Stocks signaling weakness aheadThe MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of Borosil Renewables, Tata Consumer, Tamilnad Mercantile, Mankind Pharma, CSB Bank, and Bajaj Finance among others.

Immediate support is situated at 22,300, below which the Nifty could extend its losses towards 22,000. On the other hand, the level of 22,500 might act as a technical resistance for the Nifty.

Its next greenfield hotel property will open in the coastal city of Puri in Odisha.","ITC Ltd is exploring expansion opportunities for its hotel business in Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Middle East while investing Rs 700-Rs 1,000 crore annually over the next few years on greenfield projects and renovating existing properties in India, chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said on Thursday.He said ITC is looking to add more than 70 hotels over the next five years in India, mostly through management contracts. Its next greenfield hotel property will open in the coastal city of Puri in Odisha.Puri said the demerger process of the hotel business into a separate listed entity will be completed in the fiscal second half. He, however, added that ITC won’t be involved in any plan by BAT Plc to sell its 14-15% resultant stake in the demerged hotel entity as indicated by the conglomerate’s largest shareholder, noting that BAT will certainly not sell at a discount.Puri said BAT may appoint a merchant banker to find a buyer if it eventually decides to sell.BAT chief executive Tadeu Marroco had earlier indicated it may divest its shares in the hotel business which it will get as part of the demerger process since hospitality is not an area of interest for the company.Last month, BAT sold 3.5% stake in ITC in a block deal to institutional investors for Rs 16,690 crore, paring its holding to 25.51%. Marroco had said ITC was helping BAT in the divestment process due to complex regulations and curbs on foreign investment in the Indian cigarette industry.“Even the block deal by BAT was subscribed at the upper end of the price circuit. The regulations are not an issue for divestment of shares in hotels business,” said Puri.ITC called a meeting of shareholders on June 6 to discuss approving the proposed scheme of arrangement among ITC and ITC Hotels Ltd.The company on Thursday inaugurated its first overseas hotel, ITC Ratnadipa, in Colombo, built at an investment of $500 million, also the company’s largest investment in hospitality. The five-star property has 352 rooms and an adjacent tower for residencies with 132 apartments for outright sales. Puri said the company is exploring possibilities of building residencies adjacent to its existing and new hotels in India since it is an emerging area.On overseas expansion, Puri said ITC’s subsidiary in Nepal, Surya Nepal, has a land parcel and it might build a hotel property in Kathmandu while it is also exploring management contracts. “There could be one or multiple properties there. We are also exploring more opportunities in Sri Lanka including management contracts,” he said.ITC opened 22 new hotels in the last two years, of which only one was a greenfield project with the rest being management contracts. The company currently has 134 properties.ITC is the second largest hospitality company in India, while it is a leader in cigarettes, paper and packaging industries, and the second largest in food FMCG products.Puri said there is a resurgence of tourism in India even when international tourism is not so buoyant. He said once the demerger process is over, the hotel business will also draw up an overseas expansion plan using its existing brands.The company has six brands -- ITC Hotel and Mementos in the luxury space, Storii in the premium segment, Welcomhotel in the upper to upscale segment, Fortune in the midscale segment and WelcomHeritage in heritage leisure space.

NSE Nifty advanced 168 points to close at 22,570. Nifty formed a bullish engulfing candle following a series of small candles","Domestic equity indices rebounded from a sluggish start to close higher for the fifth consecutive session on Thursday. The post-earnings surge in key benchmark constituents like Axis Bank and Nestle India fueled the gains, while Kotak Mahindra Bank plummeted following the central bank's ban on adding clients digitally.The 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex surged 487 points or 0.66% to settle at 74,339. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty advanced 168 points or 0.75% to close at 22,570.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: The resistance of Nifty is at 22650 to 22850 levels. Today's upsurge was owing to the trap of writers at the 22500 levels. These writers will further cause flurry as they are present in the May expiry as well,  said Rahul Ghose Founder & CEO, Hedged.in.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Nifty continues to stay above the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a critical near-term moving average. Additionally, the momentum indicator RSI is showing a bullish crossover, indicating positive momentum in the index value. Over the short term, the index might remain strong with an upside potential ranging between 22750-22800. On the lower end, support is placed at 22450. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday's action:US marketUS stocks were sharply lower on Thursday, dragged down by growth stocks after the quarterly results from Meta Platforms, while signs of persistent inflation dampened hopes of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates anytime soon.Meta plunged 14.7% after the Facebook-parent forecast higher expenses and lighter-than-expected revenue.Social media firms such as Snap and Pinterest fell 4.2% and 4.9%, respectively.At 9:41 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 563.67 points, or 1.47%, at 37,897.25, the S&P 500 was down 72.69 points, or 1.43%, at 4,998.94, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 336.28 points, or 2.14%, at 15,376.47.Downbeat results from other companies also weighed on equities.European sharesEuropean stocks edged lower on Thursday as traders gauged mixed earnings from blue-chip companies such as Nestle and Deutsche Bank, while big M&A news in the mining sector powered Britain's FTSE 100 to fresh peaks.The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1%, as of 0857 GMT, dented by losses in food and beverage and industrial goods sectors.Weighing on the food and beverage sector, Nestle dropped 3.4% after the world's biggest packaged food company missed estimates for first-quarter organic sales growth.Tech View: Bullish engulfing candleNifty on Thursday ended 168 points higher to form a bullish engulfing candle following a series of small candles, suggesting meaningful buying activity during the day.The hourly momentum indicator has triggered a positive crossover which is a buy signal and thus we expect the positive momentum to continue over the next few trading sessions. On the upside the next immediate hurdle is placed at 22,776. The stop-loss for long positions should be trailed at 22,430 levels, which is the 20 hour moving average, Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan said.Analysis of Nifty Put options indicates a concentration of Open Interest (OI) at the 22,500 level, suggesting potential support. On the Call side, significant OI concentrations are observed at the 22,900 and 23,000 levels, nearing all-time highs.Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of Dixon Technologies, Bajaj Finance, Cummins India, Kirloskar Industries, and Craftsman Automation, among others.The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.Stocks signalling weakness aheadThe MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of Bharat Bijlee, M&M, JSW Energy, Symphony, and Tata Power, among others.

The company's arm ITC Hotels, which had opened 22 new properties in the last 24 months, plans to add another 70 hotels in the next five years in India as part of expansion plans in the hospitality sector.  Besides the hotels business, the company will look for opportunities to expand the presence of FMCG and other verticals in new overseas markets as well.   We are open to exploring opportunities that come about. I think we have strong credentials in hospitality which we can take outside India now. Very clearly at the moment the focus is on proximal markets, be it for hospitality, be it for FMCG...,  Puri said here at a press conference after the opening of the 352-room luxury property, ITC Ratnadipa here.  He said as the company explores and understands a place for a particular business, it may look at it as a market for other verticals as well.  Citing the example of Nepal, Puri said, We started with other businesses and are now looking at hospitality (there). Here (in Sri Lanka) we have started with hospitality...as we explore and understand the place, we will look at possibilities in some of our other sectors as well.   On overseas expansion of the hospitality business, while the company's focus is more on 'proximal markets', he said, We are open to it if there are some interesting opportunities beyond it. We will certainly be interested in pursuing that.   When asked if ITC is looking at the Middle East as a market for the hospitality business, he said it is a vibrant economy right now with terrific growth plans and  if opportunity comes our way then we will certainly explore that .  Puri also said the company will look to expand in more destinations in Sri Lanka going forward.   This (opening of ITC Ratnadipa) is the starting point and yes, we want to expand and grow the economy and contribute to the development of tourism in Sri Lanka,  he said.  When asked about ITC's overall expansion plans in the hospitality sector, he said, We have a very healthy pipeline of 70 hotels in five years.   All these 70 hotels are for the Indian domestic market and most of them will be the upscale segments.  He, however, said  (For) overseas we're just starting our journey. So we have not yet got to the stage to start putting a number right here.   On investments planned for the overall expansion, he did not share a specific number but said  between renovation and new properties will spend somewhere between Rs 700 crore to Rs 1,000 crore a year .  When asked about the progress of the demerger of ITC Hotels and its planned public listing, Puri said it is happening in line with the indicated timelines and is expected  before the second half of this year or the end of this year .  At its new property here, the company had invested about USD 500 million. It was inaugurated on Thursday by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe.  The ITC Ratnadipa or 'Island of Gems' has 352 guest rooms, suites and service apartments, each with private balconies with waterfront views.  Earlier in the day, speaking at the opening of the new hotel, Puri said, It is very natural for us to specifically focus on markets in proximal areas, encouraged also by our Prime Minister's (Narendra Modi) vision of neighbourhood first where Sri Lanka has a very special position. ITC is deeply committed to growing our presence and contributing to hospitality in the region.

The scheme would unlock value of the hotels business for existing shareholders of the demerged company through independent market driven valuation of their shares in the resulting company, which will be listed pursuant to the scheme, along with the option and flexibility to remain invested in a pure play hospitality focused listed entity,  ITC said.As part of the demerger, ITC Hotels would be given a licence to use ‘ITC’ prefix as part of its corporate name and also as part of some of its properties or brand name for royalty fee.The share entitlement ratio has been determined on the basis of the share capital or the number of shares of the two companies and has no bearing on the market capitalisation of ITC Hotels.The Kolkata-based diversified conglomerate said its hotels business has matured over the years and is well poised to chart its own growth path and operate as a separate listed entity in the fast-growing hospitality industry, whilst continuing to leverage ITC’s institutional strengths, strong brand equity and goodwill.The demerger will enable the hotels unit to raise capital from equity and debt markets towards funding its growth requirements as well as attract the right sets of investors, strategic partners and collaborations, whose investment strategies and risk profiles are aligned more sharply with the hospitality industry.Following the scheme of arrangement, there would be no change in the shareholding pattern of ITC.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

ITC,2024-04-24T09:34:00+05:30,Nikhil Agarwal,How GQG's $11 billion India empire is growing fast beyond Adani,"Rajiv Jain's GQG empire in India has expanded to $11 billion, diversifying beyond Adani stocks to include stocks from various sectors like energy, banks, real estate. The portfolio now comprises a wide range of stocks.","On a high after having spotted the lucrative opportunity in Adani stocks well ahead of peers, star NRI investor Rajiv Jain is prowling Dalal Street and has picked at least 8 non-Adani stocks in the last one year with the size of his portfolio surging to $11 billion.Jain made international headlines last year in March by splurging $2 billion on Adani stocks in the peak of the Hindenburg crisis when no one was willing to catch the falling knife. With each passing quarter, GQG has been topping up its account with not just more and more of Adani stocks but is also diversifying across sectors like energy, banks, real estate, telecom, infrastructure and FMCG.The value of Florida-based GQG's Adani portfolio has now grown multi-fold to about $6.5 billion and includes six stocks - Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports, Adani Power and Ambuja Cements.Even in the March quarter, GQG raised stake in all the six Adani stocks and is believed to have spent another around $1 billion on the conglomerate. The value of his India portfolio has now surged to about $11 billion, according to calculations using shareholding data.At the end of the March quarter, GQG owned stakes in at least 14 Indian stocks while the 15th one - Vodafone Idea - was added later by investing around Rs 1,347 crore in the telecom operator’s FPO. Last month, the FII had picked up 0.8% stake in Bharti Airtel from Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) for about Rs 5,900 crore.In the March quarter, GQG raised its stake in GMR Airports by 350 basis points to 5.13%, in IDFC First Bank by 190 bps to 2.98%, in JSW Energy by 150 bps to 2.91%.Macrotech Developers, which is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the real estate upcycle, was a new pick during the quarter with 1.3% stake.The only two places in which GQG reduced stakes are in ITC (4 bps) and Max Healthcare Institute (150 bps). ITC remains its single largest bet valued at around Rs 14,600 crore.GQG started taking bigger strides on Dalal Street beyond Adani in the September quarter last year when it picked stakes in JSW Energy, Patanjali Foods and IDFC First Bank while GMR was added to its portfolio in December last year.The fund manager had earlier owned small stakes in SBI, HDFC Bank and Sun Pharma but the current ownership could not be verified independently as companies are not mandated to report names of investors with holding below 1%.Jain had last year said he expects his investment in Adani companies to deliver multibagger returns over a five-year period. We like private sector banks, IT and consumer staples. But we feel infrastructure is the new story and still under-appreciated,  the India-born emerging markets investor had said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

ITC,2024-04-23T20:46:00+05:30,Navdeep Singh,Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-Street action on Wednesday,"The NSE Nifty 50 settled 0.14% higher at 22,368, while the S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.12% to 73,738. They have gained about 1.7% each over the past three sessions.","Key equity indices rose for a third straight session on Tuesday and volatility plunged to within a whisker of its record closing low as worries over a major escalation in the Middle East conflict abated.The NSE Nifty 50 settled 0.14% higher at 22,368, while the S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.12% to 73,738. They have gained about 1.7% each over the past three sessions.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty is consolidating around the 22,400 mark, which coincides with the 61.82% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous fall from 22,776 to 21,777 and also the lower end of the gap area formed on the 15th of April. A brief consolidation is likely considering the sharp run-up and the hourly momentum indicator turning negative. This suggests that there could be a few range-bound days of price action ahead. On the upside we expect Nifty to target levels of 22560 from a short-term perspective,  said Jatin Gedia, Sharekhan.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing a bullish crossover with a reading below 60. On the higher end, the range of 22350-22400 is likely to act as a resistance zone; a decisive breakout above 22400 might trigger a rally in the market. On the lower end, support is positioned at 22250; a breach below this level might weaken the bullish sentiment. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday's action:US marketWall Street's main indexes rose on Tuesday as some growth and chip shares gained, while stocks like General Motors and Spotify advanced on upbeat earnings updates ahead of quarterly reports from big technology companies.Some megacap growth stocks including Meta Platforms , Microsoft and Alphabet gained between 1.1% and 2.3% in early trading.At 9:49 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 152.31 points, or 0.40%, at 38,392.29, the S&P 500 was up 34.72 points, or 0.69%, at 5,045.32, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 135.98 points, or 0.88%, at 15,587.28.European sharesEuropean stocks scaled to their highest levels in more than a week on Tuesday, driven by the healthcare and technology sector, as investors found comfort in upbeat corporate earnings, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index climbed to hit an all-time peak.The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.6%, as of 0838 GMT, boosted by a nearly 0.9% jump in healthcare stocks .Helping the sector's rise was a 4.8% gain in Novartis as the Swiss drugmaker raised its full-year outlook after reporting first-quarter results that surpassed expectations.Tech View: Small negative candleNifty on Tuesday ended 32 points higher to reclaim its level above 20-DEMA placed at 22309 and formed a small negative candle, which is indicating ongoing range-bound movement in the market.The near-term uptrend status of Nifty remains intact and the short-term trend is choppy. Further consolidation or minor dip could be a buying opportunity. A sustainable move above 22500 could open next upside towards 22800 levels. Immediate support is at 22200 levels, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.Analyzing the Open Interest (OI) data, the highest OI on the call side was observed at 22,500 followed by the 22,600 strike prices. Conversely, on the put side, the highest OI was recorded at the 22,100 strike price.Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of Tata Teleservices, ITI, Aptus Value Housing Finance, Biocon, Nazara Technologies, and Kaynes Technology India among others.The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.

ITC,2024-04-21T23:06:00+05:30,Anumeha Chaturvedi,Delhi hotels far from being able to benefit from rising big-ticket events business,"Ayush Dabas, owner of Welcomhotel by ITC Hotels in Dwarka, Delhi, is eager to expand his property's facilities to meet the increasing demand for MICE events. However, existing norms make it unfeasible for hotels to increase their floor area ratio (FAR) due to restrictions on parking and ground coverage. This limitation, coupled with high FAR rates for hotels compared to commercial establishments, has hindered the growth of hotel supply in Delhi.","Ayush Dabas, owner of Welcomhotel by ITC Hotels in Dwarka, Delhi, would like to expand the facilities at his property to cater to the growing demand from big-ticket MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) events, but is unable to do so because the existing norms make it “unfeasible”. “In 2014, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) increased the floor area ratio (FAR) for hotels from 225 to 375, an over 60% increase. But, that has become a paper exercise as technically, hotels are unable to increase FAR because the development norms of parking and ground coverage were not relaxed,” said Dabas. “The FAR rates for hotels for adding new supply are also four to five times that of commercial establishments. The business for commercial establishments is a much more stable business with a fixed stream of rentals which can sold or discounted by banks. The hotel business on the other hand is cyclical, and less stable, more capital intensive with lower returns and the capital markets for hotels unlike commercial are non existent,  he added. Dabas said there is talk of India pitching for the COP-33 summit, and bidding for the 2036 Olympic Games and the Delhi airport becoming one of the largest in the world with the opening of a new T1. “But, if hotels are unable to add new supply, the city will become unaffordable for travelers. It takes four to five years to build hotels, and supply can’t be added overnight,” he added. 109481889 According to industry body Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI), given a lacklustre addition of supply over the past 10 years and a similar situation being foreseen going ahead, hotels in Delhi run the risk of running out of rooms, or becoming unaffordable in case of big ticket events.Other industry insiders said several significant impediments contribute to the dearth of new supply in Delhi’s hospitality sector. Pradeep Shetty, president, FHRAI, told ET FHRAI has written to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on the matter. He said DDA had notified a policy in April 2014 for an increase in the floor area ratio (FAR) for hotels. However, despite more than 10 years since the formulation of the policy, no hotel in Delhi has been able to enhance the FAR. As per the 2023 Hotelivate Trends & Opportunities report, between 2013-14 to 2022-2023, markets such as Bengaluru, Agra, Goa, Chennai and Kolkata saw an uptick in supply by 51%, 72.5%, 87.2%, 37.3%, and 124% respectively compared to 20.5% for New Delhi. As per the report, Bengaluru has overtaken New Delhi to become the largest hotel market in India in terms of inventory, and while Mumbai added lesser supply at 13.4%, going forward, with a larger proposed pipeline, Mumbai is likely to overtake New Delhi to become the second largest hotel market.Mandeep S. Lamba, president and CEO (South Asia) at HVS ANAROCK said the hotel sector in New Delhi, currently with nearly 15,000 branded hotel keys, has experienced a modest supply growth at a CAGR of 1.4% since 2014. “The sluggish supply growth in New Delhi, combined with a rise in demand has led to a demand-supply imbalance which is expected to become significant over the next few years, thereby boosting both average room rates and occupancy rates,” he added.According to Lamba, the main ⁠hurdle for supply growth has been the lack of land availability in Grade A locations.  The last significant land allocation in the city was at the Aerocity, which has now been fully absorbed. This has spurred hotel supply growth in nearby areas such as Gurugram,  he added. Nandivardhan Jain, founder and CEO of NOESIS Capital Advisors said the exorbitant cost of land in the capital renders many projects financially unviable, resulting in diminished return on investment vis a vis other asset classes like retail and office spaces. “Hotel projects entail high capital expenditure and protracted gestation periods, typically spanning three to four years for development and an additional two years for business stabilisation,” he said. “The financial viability of such projects is further hampered by the costs associated with debt and its tenure which often deter potential investors. Additionally, the limited floor space index available for development in comparison to other metropolitan areas exacerbates the challenge of expanding the hospitality infrastructure in Delhi,” he added. Jain said regrettably, Delhi’s proposed new growth lags behind several key markets such as Bengaluru, Mumbai and Kolkata. “This disparity underscores the urgency for concerted efforts to address the prevailing challenges and incentivise investment in the hospitality sector to sustain Delhi’s competitiveness in the market,” he added.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/delhi-hotels-far-from-being-able-to-benefit-from-rising-big-ticket-events-business/articleshow/109481285.cms

But they lost about 1.6% over the holiday-shortened week.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: Technically, the set-up is mildly negative at this point with Nifty below the crucial resistance zone of 22,300-350. A crossover beyond this area is required for the bulls to be back in the game. Any immediate closing above 22,300-350 levels should bring back fresh buying momentum. Support for Nifty is now seen at 22,000 and 21,700-800. On the higher side, the immediate resistance zone for Nifty is at 22,150-175 levels and the next crucial resistance zone is at 22,300-350 levels. Overall, the coming week should set up the market for a large trending move,  said Tejas Shah, JM Financial & BlinkX.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Looking ahead, bulls may drive Nifty's recovery towards 22,300. Furthermore, a decisive breakthrough above 22,300 could trigger a sustained rally towards 22,600. On the downside, support on a closing basis is situated at 22,000. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday's action:US marketThe Nasdaq and the S&P 500 ended lower on Friday as Netflix shares weighed, but American Express kept the Dow afloat after quarterly earnings from both companies, while growing pessimism that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon also dented sentiment.For the week, the S&P 500 fell 3.05%, the Nasdaq declined 5.52%, and the Dow climbed 0.01%. The S&P suffered its biggest weekly decline since March 2023 and the Nasdaq its largest since the week of October 31, 2022.European sharesEuropean stocks closed lower on Friday, but off their over one-month intraday low, as anxiety around escalating Middle East tensions seemed to ease, while French cosmetic giant L'Oreal logged its best day since early January after robust results.The continent-wide STOXX 600 closed 0.1% lower, but notching its biggest weekly decline of 1.2% since mid-January owing to renewed focus on geopolitical tensions that steered investors away from risky assets and a rout in technology stocks.Tech View: Bullish reversal patternNifty on Friday ended 151 points higher after four successive days of decline and formed a bullish reversal pattern on the daily chart.The psychological mark of 22,000 holds intermediate support, followed by strong support of the 21800-21700 subzone. On the higher end, the 20-DEMA placed at 22300, followed by a bearish gap of 22430-22500, is likely to act as a daunting task in the near period and an authoritative breakthrough could only re-strengthen the lost momentum to the bulls of D-Street, said Osho Krishan of Angel One.Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of Kalpataru Power, Linde India, JSPL, Chennai Petro, HUL, and Power Grid among others.The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.

ITC,2024-04-16T19:06:00+05:30,ET Online,Boardroom Leela: Why are ITC and Hotel Leela at loggerheads?,"The battle between the two has been raging for the last five years and, of course, Hotel Leelaventure Limited (HLV) has contested claims made by ITC which holds a 7.92% stake in HLV.","One of India's biggest diversified conglomerates, tobacco-to-hotels ITC Ltd, has claimed  oppression  at the hands of the promoters of Hotel Leelaventure Limited (HLV) which runs hotels in India under the Leela brand. ITC says being a minority shareholder its interests are being ignored by HLV. The battle between the two has been raging for the last five years and, of course, HLV has contested claims made by ITC which holds a 7.92% stake in HLV.Since 2008, ITC has been buying shares of HLV from the open market through Russell Credit, its investment arm. In March 2017, after part of HLV's debt was converted into equity, ITC’s shareholding in the hotels chain had dropped from 11.8% to the current level of 7.92%. At that time, JM Financial ARC had converted Rs 275 crore debt into 26% equity in Hotel Leela.How it all began In January 2019, debt-laden HLV Limited went into insolvency under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). HLV had announced in March 2019 that the company's hotel business together with all the assets and liabilities of hotels located in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Udaipur were being acquired by Brookfield on a slump sale basis for ?3,950 crore.The company had said besides the four assets, the transaction included the transfer and assignment of all the company's contracts for the operation and management of hotels and the provision of amenity services in serviced apartments, as well as 100% shareholding in subsidiary Leela Palaces and Resorts, which owns the property and licence for the development of a hotel in Agra.In April 2019, ITC moved Sebi against the sale, and Sebi asked HLV and Brookfield to hold off the hotel assets deal even as the NCLT declined to admit ITC’s petition opposing the deal. NCLT cited its apparent ineligibility under the Companies Act which requires that only a person or entity owning at least 10 per cent of the issued share capital can move a petition of this nature. ITC was not granted relief by Sebi. The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) had allowed Leela's sale of assets to Brookfield, rejecting the ITC application challenging Sebi's order.ITC had filed a separate application seeking a waiver of the 10%-shareholding threshold needed to raise such complaints against a company. This year under its January 24 order, NCLT allowed ITC's petition.What has ITC saidITC has challenged the Leelaventure-Brookefield transaction complaining of “oppression and mismanagement”. ITC has alleged that the Leela-Brookfield transaction had been structured in a manner to circumvent applicable laws and for the benefit of the promoters who received Rs 300 crore or more out of deal consideration of Rs 4,250 crore, while the minority shareholders of HLV limited were left with nothing but a shell business and its associated liabilities. It alleges that the sale entitles promoters of the chain to a payout of Rs 300 crore for intellectual property held by them pertaining to the assets that are being sold as well as for other business expansion services that the promoters have agreed to provide to the investor. ITC alleges that the sale benefitted the promoter shareholders at the expense of other shareholders.ITC also claimed that the postal ballot for voting regarding the transaction did not disclose critical details regarding valuation of the assets, merchant bankers involved, etc.ITC said its shareholding was pushed below 10%, making it ineligible to complain after a conversion of some debt into equity by JM Financial ARC bumped up its stake in HLV. It also said that resultantly, any resolution, even special resolutions, could be passed at meetings of shareholders of HLV Limited by virtue of the brute majority of the promoters and JM Financial and Assets Reconstruction Company Limited, and the rights of the minority shareholders, including ITC, were  stifled .What has HLV saidPromoters for Hotel Leelaventure on had alleged at the NCLT in 2019 that ITC was trying to scuttle their deal with Brookfield, because the Canadian asset manager could pose it challenges in the hotels industry in India.HLV told the NCLT that ITC wanted to block its deal with Brookfield to sell some properties because it didn’t want to face a  global giant  with hotel assets worth $13 billion.  ITC is currently a rival to Brookfield and does not want to face Brookfield once it comes to India with all its might,  Ravi Kadam, a senior counsel appearing for the promoters of Leelaventure, had told the tribunal.Kadam also responded to ITC counsels' claim that Brookfield, being a PE fund, did not have expertise in running a premier hotel chain in India and was hence paying Rs 300 crore to the promoters of the company and entering into  side deals  with them while leaving minority shareholders out. Brookfield has 275 hotels across the globe but doesn’t have any in India, so it needs someone with knowledge of the local market, claimed the lawyer. He claimed the proposed payment of Rs 300 crore was  contingent  on the promoters fulfilling certain targets with half of it being a payment for the trademarks belonging to the promoter family.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/boardroom-leela-why-are-itc-and-hotel-leela-at-loggerheads/articleshow/109350706.cms

Markets extended their losing streak for a third straight session on the back of weak global cues as a sharp rise in US bond yields due to rising Middle East tensions has made equity markets less attractive and prompted investors to resort to profit-taking.

On the other hand, plastic recyclers and innovative packaging companies such as Ganesh, EPL, Uflex and ITC, which can provide solutions for making plastic recyclable, develop products using post-consumer recycled material (PCR), and offer economical alternatives to plastics, will be the key beneficiaries of the roll-out of the new rules.India will implement the mandatory norms for the recycling and reuse of recycled content for producers, importers and brand-owners of plastic packaging in a phased manner from FY2025. The new rules are a part of the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules 2022 (PWM), which aim to boost secondary plastic markets by enacting new norms to create a circular plastic economy and address the rising concerns about plastic pollution.Kotak sees Colgate and Nestle getting impacted the most among companies in its coverage as the regulations will have a higher impact on the food and oral care segment and products that require the use of transparent packaging which requires higher-quality of recycled plastic packaging material. This trades at a 40-50% premium to virgin plastic.The packaging costs of companies in the consumer staples universe are in the range of 5-13% of their revenues with a high exposure to plastic given its unique value proposition.

ITC,2024-05-05T06:00:00+05:30,Writankar Mukherjee and Sagar Malviya,From powders to liquids: Competition heats up in liquid cleaners market in India,"India's market sees a surge in liquid cleaners' popularity, driven by ecommerce growth and competition among top players like HUL, ITC, and Colgate. The trend towards premium, differentiated products reflects changing consumer preferences and aspirations.","Kolkata|Mumbai: Powders and bars are passe - liquids are cleaning up the market. India is showing a distinct shift in consumption habits, with liquid products in soaps, detergents and dish cleaners being adopted readily, executives at top companies said. Aided by the growth in ecommerce, competition in liquids cleaners is heating up with the entry of multiple new players - not just in cities but in smaller towns too.According to a recent report by researcher Kantar, just two categories in the home and personal care segment added more than 10 million new consumers in 2023, both in the liquid format. Liquid fabric softeners and washes added 14 million and 13.1 million new users, respectively. Against the overall fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market growth of 5%, these segments grew 13% and 20% each, Kantar estimated.Sales of such products have accelerated at a faster pace than solids and powders. Hindustan Unilever (HUL), ITC and Colgate-Palmolive India are expanding their liquid products portfolio. 109846047This is across brands and price points, making liquid soaps and washes the next hotspot.Everyone’s vying for a piece of the pie — startups as well as established brands such as Mamaearth, Wow, Safewash, Santoor and Wipro Consumer Care’s Chandrika, Godrej Fab and several other labels of ecommerce majors and retailers.Sameer Satpathy, divisional chief executive of personal care products at ITC, said the shift reflects the needs of an aspirational society looking for premium products that are unique and differentiated. “This trend is further fuelled by the penetration of ecommerce and digital acceleration,” he said.HUL chief executive and managing director Rohit Jawa told analysts last month that there was a macro-secular trend of consumers moving toward liquids across categories. He said there is more competition now from tier II brands, especially in fabric wash liquids. That market has now opened up and become sizable, with many global and local players having entered, he said.Jawa said HUL has already built a liquids business of almost Rs 4,000 crore across categories and relaunched liquid Surf Excel and Vim, leading to higher growth last fiscal.ITC has been betting on labels such as Fiama, Dermafique, Savlon and Nimwash to expand its liquids play. Analysts believe Colgate-Palmolive plans to expand the Palmolive brand much faster than its oral care business, with a focus on products such as body wash.The growth rate for liquid products is upwards of 50-60%, compared with the single-digit pace of growth in powders and bars. Lower penetration of liquid products has a part to play. As Jawa pointed out, the reach of bodywashes is still under 2%. This compares with 90-95% for soaps.Supermarkets are also said to be driving the shift to liquids. Reliance Retail sells more machine wash liquids than powders, which is part of the “bullish, growing and premiumising” of supermarkets in India, chief executive for the grocery business, Damodar Mall, posted on X in January.

The 30-share BSE Sensex rallied 941.12 points or 1.28 per cent to finish at 74,671.28. During the day, it zoomed 990.99 points or 1.34 per cent to 74,721.15.

Markets witnessed phenomenal buying support as Sensex quickly moved towards the crucial 75K mark after investors cheered strong corporate earnings from select frontline banking and cement companies, indicating their smooth sailing despite the global vagaries.   Optimism prevailed from the start of the trading session as cooling of US bond yields and letdown in the Middle East conflict coupled with a drop in crude oil prices generated a lot of enthusiasm amongst the investors,  Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, said.  The two-day Fed's monetary policy meeting starting Tuesday will be closely watched by global investors, although markets don't expect any change in the policy outcome, he added.  From the Sensex basket, ICICI Bank climbed nearly 5 per cent after the company on Saturday said its March quarter consolidated net profit grew 18.5 per cent to Rs 11,672 crore, helped by lower provisions.  State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank, UltraTech Cement, Axis Bank, NTPC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank and Sun Pharma were the other major gainers.  HCL Technologies tanked nearly 6 per cent after the company reported a flat year-on-year growth in net profit in the March quarter at Rs 3,986 crore.  ITC, Wipro and Bajaj Finserv were the other laggards.  In the broader market, the BSE midcap gauge jumped 0.79 per cent and smallcap index advanced 0.07 per cent.   The Indian benchmark indexes rebounded, aided by an upbeat in US tech quarter earnings and a drop in US 10-year yield. Domestically, the Bank Nifty outperformed, driven by its strong performance in the fourth quarter. An ease in the Middle East tensions, coupled with stable earnings, is expected to maintain positive market sentiment,  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.  Indian markets opened in the green following positive Asian markets, said Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

However, these losses did not overshadow the weekly gains, which were fueled by a post-results rally in key index constituents and reduced concerns regarding the Middle East.","Domestic benchmark equity indices experienced a decline on Friday, primarily due to weakness in the financial sector. However, these losses did not overshadow the weekly gains, which were fueled by a post-results rally in key index constituents and reduced concerns regarding the Middle East.The NSE Nifty 50 was down 0.67% to 22,420, on the day, while the S&P BSE Sensex shed 0.82% to 73,730. Both the indexes snapped a five-day winning streak. However, for the week, the Nifty 50 and Sensex gained about 1.25% and 1%, respectively.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: The Nifty witnessed selling pressure throughout the day and closed weak for the day down ~120 points. On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty has faced selling pressure from the resistance zone of 22560 – 22625. Until this zone is not taken out decisively, we can expect the consolidation to continue. On the downside, crucial support is now placed at 22240 – 22200 where support parameters in the form of the 40-day moving average and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from 21777 – 22626 is placed,  said Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Nifty remained under selling pressure throughout the session as the index failed to sustain above the crucial level of 22500. On the daily chart, a dark cloud cover pattern is observed, indicating a potential bearish reversal. Immediate support is situated at 22300, below which the Nifty could extend its losses towards 22000. On the other hand, the level of 22500 might act as a technical resistance for the Nifty. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday's action:US Market Close HigherUS stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq registered their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2023. Benchmark S&P 500 snapped three weeks of losses, while the Nasdaq ended four straight weeks of declines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.40%, the S&P 500 gained 1.02% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.03%.European Shares Notch 1.8% Weekly GainThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 1.2% higher, notching up a weekly gain of 1.8%, its biggest since late January.The basket of STOXX 600 banks touched a nine-month high, aided by a 6.1% jump in NatWest after the British bank's first-quarter results.Tech View: Dark cloud cover candlestickNifty ended 150 points lower on Friday to form a dark cloud cover candlestick on the daily chart while the weekly one saw a high wave type candle suggesting consolidation in the near term.The short-term trend of Nifty seems to have reversed down after a reasonable rise from the lows. Immediate support is placed at 22300 and the weakness below this support could trigger more declines ahead. Immediate resistance is at 22625 levels, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.Stocks showing bullish bias:Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of HUDCO, Westlife Foodworld, Tech Mahindra, DCM Shriram, Lemon Tree Hotels, and Bank of Maharashtra among others.The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.

Its next greenfield hotel property will open in the coastal city of Puri in Odisha.","ITC Ltd is exploring expansion opportunities for its hotel business in Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Middle East while investing Rs 700-Rs 1,000 crore annually over the next few years on greenfield projects and renovating existing properties in India, chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said on Thursday.He said ITC is looking to add more than 70 hotels over the next five years in India, mostly through management contracts. Its next greenfield hotel property will open in the coastal city of Puri in Odisha.Puri said the demerger process of the hotel business into a separate listed entity will be completed in the fiscal second half. He, however, added that ITC won’t be involved in any plan by BAT Plc to sell its 14-15% resultant stake in the demerged hotel entity as indicated by the conglomerate’s largest shareholder, noting that BAT will certainly not sell at a discount.Puri said BAT may appoint a merchant banker to find a buyer if it eventually decides to sell.BAT chief executive Tadeu Marroco had earlier indicated it may divest its shares in the hotel business which it will get as part of the demerger process since hospitality is not an area of interest for the company.Last month, BAT sold 3.5% stake in ITC in a block deal to institutional investors for Rs 16,690 crore, paring its holding to 25.51%. Marroco had said ITC was helping BAT in the divestment process due to complex regulations and curbs on foreign investment in the Indian cigarette industry.“Even the block deal by BAT was subscribed at the upper end of the price circuit. The regulations are not an issue for divestment of shares in hotels business,” said Puri.ITC called a meeting of shareholders on June 6 to discuss approving the proposed scheme of arrangement among ITC and ITC Hotels Ltd.The company on Thursday inaugurated its first overseas hotel, ITC Ratnadipa, in Colombo, built at an investment of $500 million, also the company’s largest investment in hospitality. The five-star property has 352 rooms and an adjacent tower for residencies with 132 apartments for outright sales. Puri said the company is exploring possibilities of building residencies adjacent to its existing and new hotels in India since it is an emerging area.On overseas expansion, Puri said ITC’s subsidiary in Nepal, Surya Nepal, has a land parcel and it might build a hotel property in Kathmandu while it is also exploring management contracts. “There could be one or multiple properties there. We are also exploring more opportunities in Sri Lanka including management contracts,” he said.ITC opened 22 new hotels in the last two years, of which only one was a greenfield project with the rest being management contracts. The company currently has 134 properties.ITC is the second largest hospitality company in India, while it is a leader in cigarettes, paper and packaging industries, and the second largest in food FMCG products.Puri said there is a resurgence of tourism in India even when international tourism is not so buoyant. He said once the demerger process is over, the hotel business will also draw up an overseas expansion plan using its existing brands.The company has six brands -- ITC Hotel and Mementos in the luxury space, Storii in the premium segment, Welcomhotel in the upper to upscale segment, Fortune in the midscale segment and WelcomHeritage in heritage leisure space.

ITC,2024-04-25T21:21:00+05:30,Navdeep Singh,Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-Street action on Friday,"Sensex on Thursday surged 487 points to settle at 74,339. NSE Nifty advanced 168 points to close at 22,570. Nifty formed a bullish engulfing candle following a series of small candles","Domestic equity indices rebounded from a sluggish start to close higher for the fifth consecutive session on Thursday. The post-earnings surge in key benchmark constituents like Axis Bank and Nestle India fueled the gains, while Kotak Mahindra Bank plummeted following the central bank's ban on adding clients digitally.The 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex surged 487 points or 0.66% to settle at 74,339. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty advanced 168 points or 0.75% to close at 22,570.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: The resistance of Nifty is at 22650 to 22850 levels. Today's upsurge was owing to the trap of writers at the 22500 levels. These writers will further cause flurry as they are present in the May expiry as well,  said Rahul Ghose Founder & CEO, Hedged.in.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Nifty continues to stay above the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a critical near-term moving average. Additionally, the momentum indicator RSI is showing a bullish crossover, indicating positive momentum in the index value. Over the short term, the index might remain strong with an upside potential ranging between 22750-22800. On the lower end, support is placed at 22450. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday's action:US marketUS stocks were sharply lower on Thursday, dragged down by growth stocks after the quarterly results from Meta Platforms, while signs of persistent inflation dampened hopes of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates anytime soon.Meta plunged 14.7% after the Facebook-parent forecast higher expenses and lighter-than-expected revenue.Social media firms such as Snap and Pinterest fell 4.2% and 4.9%, respectively.At 9:41 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 563.67 points, or 1.47%, at 37,897.25, the S&P 500 was down 72.69 points, or 1.43%, at 4,998.94, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 336.28 points, or 2.14%, at 15,376.47.Downbeat results from other companies also weighed on equities.European sharesEuropean stocks edged lower on Thursday as traders gauged mixed earnings from blue-chip companies such as Nestle and Deutsche Bank, while big M&A news in the mining sector powered Britain's FTSE 100 to fresh peaks.The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1%, as of 0857 GMT, dented by losses in food and beverage and industrial goods sectors.Weighing on the food and beverage sector, Nestle dropped 3.4% after the world's biggest packaged food company missed estimates for first-quarter organic sales growth.Tech View: Bullish engulfing candleNifty on Thursday ended 168 points higher to form a bullish engulfing candle following a series of small candles, suggesting meaningful buying activity during the day.The hourly momentum indicator has triggered a positive crossover which is a buy signal and thus we expect the positive momentum to continue over the next few trading sessions. On the upside the next immediate hurdle is placed at 22,776. The stop-loss for long positions should be trailed at 22,430 levels, which is the 20 hour moving average, Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan said.Analysis of Nifty Put options indicates a concentration of Open Interest (OI) at the 22,500 level, suggesting potential support. On the Call side, significant OI concentrations are observed at the 22,900 and 23,000 levels, nearing all-time highs.Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of Dixon Technologies, Bajaj Finance, Cummins India, Kirloskar Industries, and Craftsman Automation, among others.The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.Stocks signalling weakness aheadThe MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of Bharat Bijlee, M&M, JSW Energy, Symphony, and Tata Power, among others.

Investors placed more bullish bets on the monthly F&O expiry day, which saw benchmark indices rally for the fifth straight session led by gains in frontline banking and metal stocks. Even the fall in other Asian and European indices and US Dow Futures witnessing a sharp fall too didn't deter local investors.   FIIs fund outflows have been a concern area but India's strong growth prospects and hopes of a majority win for the ruling party in the upcoming elections has been drawing a lot of domestic investors to take exposure to equities,  Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, said.  From the Sensex basket, Axis Bank jumped 6 per cent after the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 7,599 crore during the March 2024 quarter.  State Bank of India, JSW Steel, Nestle, Sun Pharma, ITC, NTPC, Mahindra & Mahindra and HCL Technologies were among the other major gainers.  Kotak Mahindra Bank tanked 10.85 per cent after the RBI barred the company from onboarding customers online and issuing credit cards.  Hindustan Unilever, Titan, Bajaj Finance, Maruti and Asian Paints were among the other laggards.   The market breadth was strong, with oil prices correcting due to easing conflict in the Middle East and weakening US demand. The global market largely traded on a mixed note and is now focused on earning reports,  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.

ITC,2024-04-25T15:29:00+05:30,PTI,ITC plans to open more hotels overseas: Sanjiv Puri,"Besides the hotels business, the company will look for opportunities to expand the presence of FMCG and other verticals in new overseas markets as well.","India's diversified entity ITC plans to open more hotels overseas with neighbouring countries and the Middle East as primary target markets after opening of its first international property here, company Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said on Thursday. The company's arm ITC Hotels, which had opened 22 new properties in the last 24 months, plans to add another 70 hotels in the next five years in India as part of expansion plans in the hospitality sector.  Besides the hotels business, the company will look for opportunities to expand the presence of FMCG and other verticals in new overseas markets as well.   We are open to exploring opportunities that come about. I think we have strong credentials in hospitality which we can take outside India now. Very clearly at the moment the focus is on proximal markets, be it for hospitality, be it for FMCG...,  Puri said here at a press conference after the opening of the 352-room luxury property, ITC Ratnadipa here.  He said as the company explores and understands a place for a particular business, it may look at it as a market for other verticals as well.  Citing the example of Nepal, Puri said, We started with other businesses and are now looking at hospitality (there). Here (in Sri Lanka) we have started with hospitality...as we explore and understand the place, we will look at possibilities in some of our other sectors as well.   On overseas expansion of the hospitality business, while the company's focus is more on 'proximal markets', he said, We are open to it if there are some interesting opportunities beyond it. We will certainly be interested in pursuing that.   When asked if ITC is looking at the Middle East as a market for the hospitality business, he said it is a vibrant economy right now with terrific growth plans and  if opportunity comes our way then we will certainly explore that .  Puri also said the company will look to expand in more destinations in Sri Lanka going forward.   This (opening of ITC Ratnadipa) is the starting point and yes, we want to expand and grow the economy and contribute to the development of tourism in Sri Lanka,  he said.  When asked about ITC's overall expansion plans in the hospitality sector, he said, We have a very healthy pipeline of 70 hotels in five years.   All these 70 hotels are for the Indian domestic market and most of them will be the upscale segments.  He, however, said  (For) overseas we're just starting our journey. So we have not yet got to the stage to start putting a number right here.   On investments planned for the overall expansion, he did not share a specific number but said  between renovation and new properties will spend somewhere between Rs 700 crore to Rs 1,000 crore a year .  When asked about the progress of the demerger of ITC Hotels and its planned public listing, Puri said it is happening in line with the indicated timelines and is expected  before the second half of this year or the end of this year .  At its new property here, the company had invested about USD 500 million. It was inaugurated on Thursday by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe.  The ITC Ratnadipa or 'Island of Gems' has 352 guest rooms, suites and service apartments, each with private balconies with waterfront views.  Earlier in the day, speaking at the opening of the new hotel, Puri said, It is very natural for us to specifically focus on markets in proximal areas, encouraged also by our Prime Minister's (Narendra Modi) vision of neighbourhood first where Sri Lanka has a very special position. ITC is deeply committed to growing our presence and contributing to hospitality in the region.

ITC,2024-04-24T18:32:00+05:30,Shivendra Kumar,ITC Hotels Demerger: ITC to hold meeting of ordinary shareholders on June 6 to approve scheme,The move comes following an order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to convene a meeting of the ordinary shareholders of the company.  ,"Cigarette-to-FMCG conglomerate ITC will convene a meeting of the company’s ordinary shareholders on June 6, 2024, to approve the proposed scheme of arrangement involving the demerger of ITC Hotels from ITC Limited into a separate listed subsidiary, the company on Wednesday said in an exchange filing.The meeting will be held at 10:30 am India time through the electronic mode.The move comes following an order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to convene a meeting of the ordinary shareholders of the company. The announcement was made after market hours and ITC shares on Wednesday ended flat on the NSE at Rs 429.40.The board had on August 14 approved the scheme of arrangement under which the shareholders of ITC will get 1 share in the demerged hotels business for every 10 shares held in the parent company.Once the demerger is completed following approval from shareholders, creditors, stock exchanges, Sebi, NCLT and other regulatory authorities, ITC is likely to get the new stock listed on stock exchanges in another 15 months.ITC shareholders will directly hold about 60% in ITC Hotels in proportion to their stake in the parent company. The remaining 40% stake will continue with ITC. No cash consideration is payable under the demerger scheme. The scheme would unlock value of the hotels business for existing shareholders of the demerged company through independent market driven valuation of their shares in the resulting company, which will be listed pursuant to the scheme, along with the option and flexibility to remain invested in a pure play hospitality focused listed entity,  ITC said.As part of the demerger, ITC Hotels would be given a licence to use ‘ITC’ prefix as part of its corporate name and also as part of some of its properties or brand name for royalty fee.The share entitlement ratio has been determined on the basis of the share capital or the number of shares of the two companies and has no bearing on the market capitalisation of ITC Hotels.The Kolkata-based diversified conglomerate said its hotels business has matured over the years and is well poised to chart its own growth path and operate as a separate listed entity in the fast-growing hospitality industry, whilst continuing to leverage ITC’s institutional strengths, strong brand equity and goodwill.The demerger will enable the hotels unit to raise capital from equity and debt markets towards funding its growth requirements as well as attract the right sets of investors, strategic partners and collaborations, whose investment strategies and risk profiles are aligned more sharply with the hospitality industry.Following the scheme of arrangement, there would be no change in the shareholding pattern of ITC.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The portfolio now comprises a wide range of stocks.","On a high after having spotted the lucrative opportunity in Adani stocks well ahead of peers, star NRI investor Rajiv Jain is prowling Dalal Street and has picked at least 8 non-Adani stocks in the last one year with the size of his portfolio surging to $11 billion.Jain made international headlines last year in March by splurging $2 billion on Adani stocks in the peak of the Hindenburg crisis when no one was willing to catch the falling knife. With each passing quarter, GQG has been topping up its account with not just more and more of Adani stocks but is also diversifying across sectors like energy, banks, real estate, telecom, infrastructure and FMCG.The value of Florida-based GQG's Adani portfolio has now grown multi-fold to about $6.5 billion and includes six stocks - Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports, Adani Power and Ambuja Cements.Even in the March quarter, GQG raised stake in all the six Adani stocks and is believed to have spent another around $1 billion on the conglomerate. The value of his India portfolio has now surged to about $11 billion, according to calculations using shareholding data.At the end of the March quarter, GQG owned stakes in at least 14 Indian stocks while the 15th one - Vodafone Idea - was added later by investing around Rs 1,347 crore in the telecom operator’s FPO. Last month, the FII had picked up 0.8% stake in Bharti Airtel from Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) for about Rs 5,900 crore.In the March quarter, GQG raised its stake in GMR Airports by 350 basis points to 5.13%, in IDFC First Bank by 190 bps to 2.98%, in JSW Energy by 150 bps to 2.91%.Macrotech Developers, which is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the real estate upcycle, was a new pick during the quarter with 1.3% stake.The only two places in which GQG reduced stakes are in ITC (4 bps) and Max Healthcare Institute (150 bps). ITC remains its single largest bet valued at around Rs 14,600 crore.GQG started taking bigger strides on Dalal Street beyond Adani in the September quarter last year when it picked stakes in JSW Energy, Patanjali Foods and IDFC First Bank while GMR was added to its portfolio in December last year.The fund manager had earlier owned small stakes in SBI, HDFC Bank and Sun Pharma but the current ownership could not be verified independently as companies are not mandated to report names of investors with holding below 1%.Jain had last year said he expects his investment in Adani companies to deliver multibagger returns over a five-year period. We like private sector banks, IT and consumer staples. But we feel infrastructure is the new story and still under-appreciated,  the India-born emerging markets investor had said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

They have gained about 1.7% each over the past three sessions.","Key equity indices rose for a third straight session on Tuesday and volatility plunged to within a whisker of its record closing low as worries over a major escalation in the Middle East conflict abated.The NSE Nifty 50 settled 0.14% higher at 22,368, while the S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.12% to 73,738. They have gained about 1.7% each over the past three sessions.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty is consolidating around the 22,400 mark, which coincides with the 61.82% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous fall from 22,776 to 21,777 and also the lower end of the gap area formed on the 15th of April. A brief consolidation is likely considering the sharp run-up and the hourly momentum indicator turning negative. This suggests that there could be a few range-bound days of price action ahead. On the upside we expect Nifty to target levels of 22560 from a short-term perspective,  said Jatin Gedia, Sharekhan.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing a bullish crossover with a reading below 60. On the higher end, the range of 22350-22400 is likely to act as a resistance zone; a decisive breakout above 22400 might trigger a rally in the market. On the lower end, support is positioned at 22250; a breach below this level might weaken the bullish sentiment. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday's action:US marketWall Street's main indexes rose on Tuesday as some growth and chip shares gained, while stocks like General Motors and Spotify advanced on upbeat earnings updates ahead of quarterly reports from big technology companies.Some megacap growth stocks including Meta Platforms , Microsoft and Alphabet gained between 1.1% and 2.3% in early trading.At 9:49 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 152.31 points, or 0.40%, at 38,392.29, the S&P 500 was up 34.72 points, or 0.69%, at 5,045.32, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 135.98 points, or 0.88%, at 15,587.28.European sharesEuropean stocks scaled to their highest levels in more than a week on Tuesday, driven by the healthcare and technology sector, as investors found comfort in upbeat corporate earnings, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index climbed to hit an all-time peak.The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.6%, as of 0838 GMT, boosted by a nearly 0.9% jump in healthcare stocks .Helping the sector's rise was a 4.8% gain in Novartis as the Swiss drugmaker raised its full-year outlook after reporting first-quarter results that surpassed expectations.Tech View: Small negative candleNifty on Tuesday ended 32 points higher to reclaim its level above 20-DEMA placed at 22309 and formed a small negative candle, which is indicating ongoing range-bound movement in the market.The near-term uptrend status of Nifty remains intact and the short-term trend is choppy. Further consolidation or minor dip could be a buying opportunity. A sustainable move above 22500 could open next upside towards 22800 levels. Immediate support is at 22200 levels, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.Analyzing the Open Interest (OI) data, the highest OI on the call side was observed at 22,500 followed by the 22,600 strike prices.

ITC,2024-04-21T23:06:00+05:30,Anumeha Chaturvedi,Delhi hotels far from being able to benefit from rising big-ticket events business,"Ayush Dabas, owner of Welcomhotel by ITC Hotels in Dwarka, Delhi, is eager to expand his property's facilities to meet the increasing demand for MICE events. However, existing norms make it unfeasible for hotels to increase their floor area ratio (FAR) due to restrictions on parking and ground coverage. This limitation, coupled with high FAR rates for hotels compared to commercial establishments, has hindered the growth of hotel supply in Delhi.","Ayush Dabas, owner of Welcomhotel by ITC Hotels in Dwarka, Delhi, would like to expand the facilities at his property to cater to the growing demand from big-ticket MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) events, but is unable to do so because the existing norms make it “unfeasible”. “In 2014, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) increased the floor area ratio (FAR) for hotels from 225 to 375, an over 60% increase. But, that has become a paper exercise as technically, hotels are unable to increase FAR because the development norms of parking and ground coverage were not relaxed,” said Dabas. “The FAR rates for hotels for adding new supply are also four to five times that of commercial establishments. The business for commercial establishments is a much more stable business with a fixed stream of rentals which can sold or discounted by banks. The hotel business on the other hand is cyclical, and less stable, more capital intensive with lower returns and the capital markets for hotels unlike commercial are non existent,  he added. Dabas said there is talk of India pitching for the COP-33 summit, and bidding for the 2036 Olympic Games and the Delhi airport becoming one of the largest in the world with the opening of a new T1. “But, if hotels are unable to add new supply, the city will become unaffordable for travelers. It takes four to five years to build hotels, and supply can’t be added overnight,” he added. 109481889 According to industry body Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI), given a lacklustre addition of supply over the past 10 years and a similar situation being foreseen going ahead, hotels in Delhi run the risk of running out of rooms, or becoming unaffordable in case of big ticket events.Other industry insiders said several significant impediments contribute to the dearth of new supply in Delhi’s hospitality sector. Pradeep Shetty, president, FHRAI, told ET FHRAI has written to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on the matter. He said DDA had notified a policy in April 2014 for an increase in the floor area ratio (FAR) for hotels. However, despite more than 10 years since the formulation of the policy, no hotel in Delhi has been able to enhance the FAR. As per the 2023 Hotelivate Trends & Opportunities report, between 2013-14 to 2022-2023, markets such as Bengaluru, Agra, Goa, Chennai and Kolkata saw an uptick in supply by 51%, 72.5%, 87.2%, 37.3%, and 124% respectively compared to 20.5% for New Delhi. As per the report, Bengaluru has overtaken New Delhi to become the largest hotel market in India in terms of inventory, and while Mumbai added lesser supply at 13.4%, going forward, with a larger proposed pipeline, Mumbai is likely to overtake New Delhi to become the second largest hotel market.Mandeep S. Lamba, president and CEO (South Asia) at HVS ANAROCK said the hotel sector in New Delhi, currently with nearly 15,000 branded hotel keys, has experienced a modest supply growth at a CAGR of 1.4% since 2014. “The sluggish supply growth in New Delhi, combined with a rise in demand has led to a demand-supply imbalance which is expected to become significant over the next few years, thereby boosting both average room rates and occupancy rates,” he added.According to Lamba, the main ⁠hurdle for supply growth has been the lack of land availability in Grade A locations.  The last significant land allocation in the city was at the Aerocity, which has now been fully absorbed. This has spurred hotel supply growth in nearby areas such as Gurugram,  he added. Nandivardhan Jain, founder and CEO of NOESIS Capital Advisors said the exorbitant cost of land in the capital renders many projects financially unviable, resulting in diminished return on investment vis a vis other asset classes like retail and office spaces. “Hotel projects entail high capital expenditure and protracted gestation periods, typically spanning three to four years for development and an additional two years for business stabilisation,” he said. “The financial viability of such projects is further hampered by the costs associated with debt and its tenure which often deter potential investors. Additionally, the limited floor space index available for development in comparison to other metropolitan areas exacerbates the challenge of expanding the hospitality infrastructure in Delhi,” he added. Jain said regrettably, Delhi’s proposed new growth lags behind several key markets such as Bengaluru, Mumbai and Kolkata. “This disparity underscores the urgency for concerted efforts to address the prevailing challenges and incentivise investment in the hospitality sector to sustain Delhi’s competitiveness in the market,” he added.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/delhi-hotels-far-from-being-able-to-benefit-from-rising-big-ticket-events-business/articleshow/109481285.cms

But they lost about 1.6% over the holiday-shortened week.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: Technically, the set-up is mildly negative at this point with Nifty below the crucial resistance zone of 22,300-350. A crossover beyond this area is required for the bulls to be back in the game. Any immediate closing above 22,300-350 levels should bring back fresh buying momentum. Support for Nifty is now seen at 22,000 and 21,700-800. On the higher side, the immediate resistance zone for Nifty is at 22,150-175 levels and the next crucial resistance zone is at 22,300-350 levels. Overall, the coming week should set up the market for a large trending move,  said Tejas Shah, JM Financial & BlinkX.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Looking ahead, bulls may drive Nifty's recovery towards 22,300. Furthermore, a decisive breakthrough above 22,300 could trigger a sustained rally towards 22,600. On the downside, support on a closing basis is situated at 22,000. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday's action:US marketThe Nasdaq and the S&P 500 ended lower on Friday as Netflix shares weighed, but American Express kept the Dow afloat after quarterly earnings from both companies, while growing pessimism that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon also dented sentiment.For the week, the S&P 500 fell 3.05%, the Nasdaq declined 5.52%, and the Dow climbed 0.01%. The S&P suffered its biggest weekly decline since March 2023 and the Nasdaq its largest since the week of October 31, 2022.European sharesEuropean stocks closed lower on Friday, but off their over one-month intraday low, as anxiety around escalating Middle East tensions seemed to ease, while French cosmetic giant L'Oreal logged its best day since early January after robust results.The continent-wide STOXX 600 closed 0.1% lower, but notching its biggest weekly decline of 1.2% since mid-January owing to renewed focus on geopolitical tensions that steered investors away from risky assets and a rout in technology stocks.Tech View: Bullish reversal patternNifty on Friday ended 151 points higher after four successive days of decline and formed a bullish reversal pattern on the daily chart.The psychological mark of 22,000 holds intermediate support, followed by strong support of the 21800-21700 subzone. On the higher end, the 20-DEMA placed at 22300, followed by a bearish gap of 22430-22500, is likely to act as a daunting task in the near period and an authoritative breakthrough could only re-strengthen the lost momentum to the bulls of D-Street, said Osho Krishan of Angel One.Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of Kalpataru Power, Linde India, JSPL, Chennai Petro, HUL, and Power Grid among others.The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.

ITC,2024-04-16T19:06:00+05:30,ET Online,Boardroom Leela: Why are ITC and Hotel Leela at loggerheads?,"The battle between the two has been raging for the last five years and, of course, Hotel Leelaventure Limited (HLV) has contested claims made by ITC which holds a 7.92% stake in HLV.","One of India's biggest diversified conglomerates, tobacco-to-hotels ITC Ltd, has claimed  oppression  at the hands of the promoters of Hotel Leelaventure Limited (HLV) which runs hotels in India under the Leela brand. ITC says being a minority shareholder its interests are being ignored by HLV. The battle between the two has been raging for the last five years and, of course, HLV has contested claims made by ITC which holds a 7.92% stake in HLV.Since 2008, ITC has been buying shares of HLV from the open market through Russell Credit, its investment arm. In March 2017, after part of HLV's debt was converted into equity, ITC’s shareholding in the hotels chain had dropped from 11.8% to the current level of 7.92%. At that time, JM Financial ARC had converted Rs 275 crore debt into 26% equity in Hotel Leela.How it all began In January 2019, debt-laden HLV Limited went into insolvency under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). HLV had announced in March 2019 that the company's hotel business together with all the assets and liabilities of hotels located in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Udaipur were being acquired by Brookfield on a slump sale basis for ?3,950 crore.The company had said besides the four assets, the transaction included the transfer and assignment of all the company's contracts for the operation and management of hotels and the provision of amenity services in serviced apartments, as well as 100% shareholding in subsidiary Leela Palaces and Resorts, which owns the property and licence for the development of a hotel in Agra.In April 2019, ITC moved Sebi against the sale, and Sebi asked HLV and Brookfield to hold off the hotel assets deal even as the NCLT declined to admit ITC’s petition opposing the deal. NCLT cited its apparent ineligibility under the Companies Act which requires that only a person or entity owning at least 10 per cent of the issued share capital can move a petition of this nature. ITC was not granted relief by Sebi. The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) had allowed Leela's sale of assets to Brookfield, rejecting the ITC application challenging Sebi's order.ITC had filed a separate application seeking a waiver of the 10%-shareholding threshold needed to raise such complaints against a company. This year under its January 24 order, NCLT allowed ITC's petition.What has ITC saidITC has challenged the Leelaventure-Brookefield transaction complaining of “oppression and mismanagement”. ITC has alleged that the Leela-Brookfield transaction had been structured in a manner to circumvent applicable laws and for the benefit of the promoters who received Rs 300 crore or more out of deal consideration of Rs 4,250 crore, while the minority shareholders of HLV limited were left with nothing but a shell business and its associated liabilities. It alleges that the sale entitles promoters of the chain to a payout of Rs 300 crore for intellectual property held by them pertaining to the assets that are being sold as well as for other business expansion services that the promoters have agreed to provide to the investor. ITC alleges that the sale benefitted the promoter shareholders at the expense of other shareholders.ITC also claimed that the postal ballot for voting regarding the transaction did not disclose critical details regarding valuation of the assets, merchant bankers involved, etc.ITC said its shareholding was pushed below 10%, making it ineligible to complain after a conversion of some debt into equity by JM Financial ARC bumped up its stake in HLV. It also said that resultantly, any resolution, even special resolutions, could be passed at meetings of shareholders of HLV Limited by virtue of the brute majority of the promoters and JM Financial and Assets Reconstruction Company Limited, and the rights of the minority shareholders, including ITC, were  stifled .What has HLV saidPromoters for Hotel Leelaventure on had alleged at the NCLT in 2019 that ITC was trying to scuttle their deal with Brookfield, because the Canadian asset manager could pose it challenges in the hotels industry in India.HLV told the NCLT that ITC wanted to block its deal with Brookfield to sell some properties because it didn’t want to face a  global giant  with hotel assets worth $13 billion.  ITC is currently a rival to Brookfield and does not want to face Brookfield once it comes to India with all its might,  Ravi Kadam, a senior counsel appearing for the promoters of Leelaventure, had told the tribunal.Kadam also responded to ITC counsels' claim that Brookfield, being a PE fund, did not have expertise in running a premier hotel chain in India and was hence paying Rs 300 crore to the promoters of the company and entering into  side deals  with them while leaving minority shareholders out. Brookfield has 275 hotels across the globe but doesn’t have any in India, so it needs someone with knowledge of the local market, claimed the lawyer. He claimed the proposed payment of Rs 300 crore was  contingent  on the promoters fulfilling certain targets with half of it being a payment for the trademarks belonging to the promoter family.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/boardroom-leela-why-are-itc-and-hotel-leela-at-loggerheads/articleshow/109350706.cms
