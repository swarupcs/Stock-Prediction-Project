Check top 4 picks","Infosys, TCS and HCL Tech remain top picks of brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities followed by Cyient in the mid-tier segment amid an extended outlook for weak demand and macro uncertainty in the IT sector.","Infosys, TCS and HCL Tech remain top picks of brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities followed by Cyient in the mid-tier segment amid an extended outlook for weak demand and macro uncertainty in the IT sector.“Recovery hopes have been pushed back to FY2026. Stock price corrections in the past few months have made valuations more palatable. Infosys is our top pick followed by TCS and HCLT. We like Cyient among mid-tier. Further correction can make other mid-tier IT stocks interesting,” stated the report.Here’s a summary of the target price for the above-mentioned stocks:InfosysThe target price for the stock has been set at Rs 1,750, with a ‘buy’ rating. This indicates an upside potential of 22.7%.TCSKIE recommends a target price of Rs 4,300, signaling a 9.7% upside from the current market price of Rs 3,992.HCL TechnologiesHCL’s target price has been fixed 17.7% higher at Rs 1,600.CyientThe target price for Cyient is placed at Rs 2,275, 28% higher than the current price.The brokerage views that Infosys has a reasonable growth visibility in FY2025 aided by large deal wins in the past few quarters and will stand to benefit disproportionately compared to Tier-1 peers when discretionary spending picks up. Stocks such as LTIM and Persistent have come off from highs but still trade at expensive valuations. Mid-tier grew at an aggregate of 3.5% year-on-year (YoY) compared to 0.1% YoY growth of Tier-1. The difference in growth rates has reduced significantly in the past several quarters although mid-tier continues to outpace Tier-1 on growth.“IT companies outlook leads to a reset of both growth and margin expectations for FY2025. Revenue growth guidance for FY2025 missed expectations for all companies. Modest guidance was driven by a weak discretionary spending environment, continuation of ramp-downs in existing engagements although at a lower pace and slower conversion of pipeline to TCV and revenue. Companies do not expect any improvement in FY2025,” Kotak further added.IT firms indicated working on several gen AI PoCs for clients but have not provided any break-up of revenue from generative AI, unlike Accenture. At the current stage of adoption, it appears that the revenue from generative AI projects is not significant for Indian IT. Scaled-up programs and foundation work required for AI such as the development of appropriate cloud and data infrastructure can drive revenues in case the adoption increases among clients.Also read: Vijay Kedia's Portfolio: 4 stocks surge 25-60% in CY24; do you own any?(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

INFOSYS,2024-04-25T21:21:00+05:30,Navdeep Singh,Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-Street action on Friday,"Sensex on Thursday surged 487 points to settle at 74,339. NSE Nifty advanced 168 points to close at 22,570. Nifty formed a bullish engulfing candle following a series of small candles","Domestic equity indices rebounded from a sluggish start to close higher for the fifth consecutive session on Thursday. The post-earnings surge in key benchmark constituents like Axis Bank and Nestle India fueled the gains, while Kotak Mahindra Bank plummeted following the central bank's ban on adding clients digitally.The 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex surged 487 points or 0.66% to settle at 74,339. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty advanced 168 points or 0.75% to close at 22,570.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: The resistance of Nifty is at 22650 to 22850 levels. Today's upsurge was owing to the trap of writers at the 22500 levels. These writers will further cause flurry as they are present in the May expiry as well,  said Rahul Ghose Founder & CEO, Hedged.in.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Nifty continues to stay above the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a critical near-term moving average. Additionally, the momentum indicator RSI is showing a bullish crossover, indicating positive momentum in the index value. Over the short term, the index might remain strong with an upside potential ranging between 22750-22800. On the lower end, support is placed at 22450. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday's action:US marketUS stocks were sharply lower on Thursday, dragged down by growth stocks after the quarterly results from Meta Platforms, while signs of persistent inflation dampened hopes of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates anytime soon.Meta plunged 14.7% after the Facebook-parent forecast higher expenses and lighter-than-expected revenue.Social media firms such as Snap and Pinterest fell 4.2% and 4.9%, respectively.At 9:41 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 563.67 points, or 1.47%, at 37,897.25, the S&P 500 was down 72.69 points, or 1.43%, at 4,998.94, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 336.28 points, or 2.14%, at 15,376.47.Downbeat results from other companies also weighed on equities.European sharesEuropean stocks edged lower on Thursday as traders gauged mixed earnings from blue-chip companies such as Nestle and Deutsche Bank, while big M&A news in the mining sector powered Britain's FTSE 100 to fresh peaks.The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1%, as of 0857 GMT, dented by losses in food and beverage and industrial goods sectors.Weighing on the food and beverage sector, Nestle dropped 3.4% after the world's biggest packaged food company missed estimates for first-quarter organic sales growth.Tech View: Bullish engulfing candleNifty on Thursday ended 168 points higher to form a bullish engulfing candle following a series of small candles, suggesting meaningful buying activity during the day.The hourly momentum indicator has triggered a positive crossover which is a buy signal and thus we expect the positive momentum to continue over the next few trading sessions. On the upside the next immediate hurdle is placed at 22,776. The stop-loss for long positions should be trailed at 22,430 levels, which is the 20 hour moving average, Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan said.Analysis of Nifty Put options indicates a concentration of Open Interest (OI) at the 22,500 level, suggesting potential support. On the Call side, significant OI concentrations are observed at the 22,900 and 23,000 levels, nearing all-time highs.Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of Dixon Technologies, Bajaj Finance, Cummins India, Kirloskar Industries, and Craftsman Automation, among others.The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.Stocks signalling weakness aheadThe MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of Bharat Bijlee, M&M, JSW Energy, Symphony, and Tata Power, among others. Bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they have just begun their downward journey.Most active stocks in value termsKotak Bank (Rs 10,952 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 5,154 crore), SBI (Rs 2,933 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 2,680 crore), RIL (Rs 2,323 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 2,211 crore), and Infosys (Rs 1,305 crore) were among the most active stocks on the NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with highest trading turnovers in the day.Most active stocks in volume termsKotak Bank (Shares traded: 6.6 crore), Tata Steel (Shares traded: 5 crore), Axis Bank (Shares traded: 4.6 crore), SBI (Shares traded: 3.6 crore), ITC (Shares traded: 2.9 crore), Power Grid (Shares traded: 2.2 crore), and ICICI Bank (Shares traded: 1.9 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on the NSE.Stocks showing buying interestShares of SBI, JSW Steel, Eicher Motors, Hindalco, and ICICI Bank among others witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signalling bullish sentiment.Stocks seeing selling pressureShares of Kotak Bank and Dalmia Bharat hit their 52-week lows, signalling bearish sentiment on the counters.Sentiment meter favours bullsOverall, market breadth favoured bulls as 2,076 stocks ended in the green, while 1,718 names settled in the red.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

INFOSYS,2024-04-24T05:32:00+05:30,Kairavi Lukka,"D-Street goes short on fear, VIX plunges 20%"," The drop in VIX is unprecedented, as previously readings of VIX near 8-9% were seen when markets were making a top. This is showing that traders have become overly positive about the upcoming days. ","Mumbai: The Volatility Index or VIX - stock market's fear gauge - unexpectedly plunged nearly 20% on Tuesday, as strengthening expectations of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance winning by a wide margin in the upcoming general elections further boosted risk-on sentiment in the market. Analysts said an imminent change in the lot size of Nifty derivative contracts from Friday could have also contributed to Tuesday's drop in the VIX - the third-largest fall in a day. The drop in VIX is unprecedented, as previously readings of VIX near 8-9% were seen when markets were making a top. This is showing that traders have become overly positive about the upcoming days. VIX, an index based on Nifty option premiums, is a measure of traders' perception of near-term risks to the market. When traders foresee higher uncertainty, VIX increases and vice-versa. In the past, VIX has tended to spike in the run-up to key events, like elections, when the outcomes tend to be uncertain. Soon after the election outcomes, VIX plunges with the uncertainty out of the way. Usually, option premiums stay highest during the month of polling until the day of the announcement of results,  said Srivastava.  Last elections, we saw a movement of about 3% on results day, and a movement of about 7-8% in 2014, but this time the market has eliminated the outlook of a single-day movement and has already priced in and discounted the gains of the election results. 109545964The drop in VIX on Tuesday was unprecedented and may be signalling that the market is complacent, said analysts.  This fall (in VIX) ahead of elections is unique because it always moves up before the announcement of the poll results,  said Rajesh Palviya, head of technical and derivatives research at Axis Securities.  It also indicates that the market is confident or even overconfident about the outcome of the elections. The Sensex and the Nifty ended 0.1% higher on Tuesday in a choppy session, while the mid-cap and small-cap indices surged over 1% each.The VIX has mostly traded in the band of 11-14 in recent months. It hit a high of 16.7 in February before sliding to current levels. The gauge closed at 10.19 on Tuesday. In the past five years, the highest level that VIX has surged to was 86 in March 2020 - at the start Covid. VIX is trading at the lower range of its price band, which may not sustain as going ahead any uncertainty or event can lead to a pullback,  said Palviya.A change in the lot size for Nifty options from the expiry of April contracts on Thursday also added to the fall in VIX. The lot size of Nifty have been cut from 50 to 25 starting the May expiry. This will lead to an increase in liquidity and a reduction of the bid-ask spread of OTM (Out of the Money) call and put options,  said Apurva Sheth, head of research at Samco Securities.  The reduction in spreads may have led to a fall in India VIX calculation which considers both the near and next month's OTM option premiums for calculations. Analysts said signs of receding tensions in West Asia is also easing uncertainty.  We saw a fall in India VIX as the tensions related to a war between Iran and Israel have subsided, along with the results of market heavyweights like Infosys, HDFC Bank and RIL already declared, which has reduced volatility,  said Ruchit Jain, lead research analyst at 5Paisa.com.  Premiums have declined in both call and put sides, which is beneficial for option sellers but negative for option buyers, as the move in premium has been disproportionate.

Additionally, Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, Media, and Consumer Durables sectors also saw gains ranging from 0.5% to 0.7%.Expert Take The domestic market exhibited range-bound performance, tracking positive global cues with sustained outperformance of the broader market. While tensions between Iran and Israel were perceived to have limited escalation, the uptick in crude prices suggests investors’ reassessing the risks. With higher levels of dollar index and US bond yields, FIIs are expected to continue with outflows, but inflows from DIIs are supporting the recovery,  said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities said, “The Nifty remained sideways throughout the session as it failed to provide any directional breakout. On the higher end, the range of 22,350-22,400 is likely to act as a resistance zone; a decisive breakout above 22,400 might trigger a rally in the market. On the lower end, support is positioned at 22,250; a breach below this level might weaken the bullish sentiment.

Europe's booming tech sector, outpacing North America, has fueled over a dozen acquisitions since the pandemic.","Indian outsourcing leaders are increasingly acquiring companies in Europe, where the pace of revenue expansion has lately dwarfed growth rates the other side Atlantic seaboard to justify about a dozen M&As in the continent since the pandemic.While last week’s acquisition announcement of in-tech by Infosys is tipped to be the largest in the latter’s history, even Capco’s acquisition by Wipro in 2021 is the largest ever acquisition made by the company.HCLTech has done three major acquisitions overseas in the last two years, all in Europe. Similarly, for Tech Mahindra, acquisition of CTC (Com Tec Co IT Ltd) in 2022, is the second-largest acquisition that the company has made after scam-hit Satyam in April 2010.An email to Infosys didn’t elicit any response until the publication of this report.Out of the total number of acquisitions done by Infosys in the last six years, nearly 40% focused on Europe. In absolute numbers, the IT major made a total of 16 acquisitions since April 2018, and out of that six were done in Europe, followed by five in the US, as per a Kotak analyst note. The latest acquisition being an engineering R&D services provider, in-tech that is focused on the German automotive industry. The cost of the acquisition is pegged at $480 million (450 million euros).Similarly, Wipro’s largest acquisition in its history was in Europe. It acquired London-based global management and tech consultancy firm Capco for a consideration of $1.45 billion in 2021 to boost its presence in banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical. Wipro during the Q4 earnings also revealed that consulting business is seeing green shoots and Capco unit grew 6.6% sequentially, much higher than Wipro’s overall revenue growth at 0.01% QoQ.For the third largest IT major in India, HCLTech – the three major acquisitions that it has made in the last two years were all in Europe. It made its European acquisition last year when it bought German automotive engineering services company ASAP Group for $279 million. The other two acquisitions in 2022 were Starschema, a leading provider of data engineering services, based in Budapest, Hungary and Confinale AG, a Switzerland-based digital banking and wealth management consulting specialist.Fifth largest Indian IT major, Tech Mahindra’s acquisition of Europe-based CTC (Com Tec Co IT Ltd) in 2022 for $310 million, is the second-largest acquisition that the company has made after scam-hit Satyam in April 2010.Pareekh Jain, CEO, EIIRTrend “There is huge headroom for growth in Europe. But IT companies need language capabilities and local presence to penetrate the market. They are augmenting their capabilities across all service lines in Europe. For IT services, the US is the biggest market. But as far as ER&D (engineering and research and development) services is concerned, Europe is the largest amongst all geography.”Europe ER&D market size is $41 billion out of a total global $94 billion, highest in any geography. It is also fastest growing at 10% vs 8.5% globally, added Jain. And that’s one of the strong reasons for the majority of big ER&D M& As in Europe. There were more than 25 ER&D acquisitions in Europe in three years, he added.Peter Bendour Samuel, CEO, Everest Group, said, “Europe is an attractive market for Tech Services. It has grown faster than North America for 10 straight quarters and until the last two quarters it has been the fastest growing market in all the Geographies. Furthermore it is still well behind North America (NA) on digital transformation and is likely to remain an attractive market as European firms spend to catch up with their North American competitors. It also favors tech services firms with a strong domestic presence, hence the Indian companies are very active in looking for and acquiring European assets which will anchor their ongoing expansion in the region.” New Jersey based Cognizant, which has a majority of its employees based in India, acquired Mobica, an eastern European engineering service provider with 900 people, last year.Analysts say that India's largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) which is generally shy of inorganic route, hasn’t made any significant acquisitions in the last 10 years. But the IT bellwether has been active in acquiring captives of clients and its last major acquisition of client’s captive was its acquisition of 100% of the shares of Postbank Systems AG (PBS) from Deutsche Bank AG.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/europe-emerges-as-hotspot-for-indian-it-mas-tops-buy-chart/articleshow/109515130.cms

Various companies and sectors were involved in these transactions.","Hoping to see a turnaround of fortunes in FY25, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) raised stakes in TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro, Coforge and Persistent Systems in the March quarter. But as the macro environment remains uncertain with further challenges in the short run, dollar money is now having second thoughts.In the first fortnight of April, FIIs sold IT stocks worth around Rs 4,700 crore to buy power and banks.

INFOSYS,2024-04-22T06:30:00+05:30,Kumar Shankar Roy,ESG mutual funds: Why these MFs may not be the right choice for investors,"Having failed to beat even simpler fund categories, ESG funds may not be the right choice for investors.","The bull market rally that began after the Covid lows proved to be a turning point for ESG (environment, social, and governance) investing. Investors shifted their focus from how much money companies make to how they make it. In response, fund houses in India, like their global counterparts, launched a raft of ESG thematic offerings to capture the trend. However, three years down the line, most ESG funds have failed to generate superlative returns despite filling up portfolios with the so-called ‘do-gooders’ of the corporate terra firma. The category has struggled to beat one-year and three-year returns of simpler products, such as large-cap funds and flexi-cap funds.ESG investing is built on the way investee company treats the planet, cares about people, and is being governed. ESG-focused funds primarily invest in companies that are selected on ESG criteria as defined by their proprietary investment framework. The ESG theme garnered popularity in the post-Covid era, coinciding with the phase when investors sought a new plank to justify premium valuations of certain stocks. Between 2020 and 2021, eight new ESG funds were launched. In total, there are 10 ESG schemes today (eight actively managed and two passively managed) managing about Rs.11,000 crore investor assets.Active funds employ sector-level and stock-level screening to identify ESG-compliant companies. Companies are included in ESG portfolios based on strength in one or two ESG parameters, not necessarily all three. While ESG scores/risk scores are an integral part of the investment research process, funds are not restrained by them. In July 2023, market regulator Sebi allowed AMCs to launch multiple ESG schemes with different sub-strategies like exclusion, integration, best-in-class and positive screening, impact investing, sustainable objectives, and transition or transition-related investments. ESG funds are required to allocate a minimum 80% of total assets to equities, following their specified strategy.Following this, two ESG funds from ABSL and Axis specified that they would employ integration strategy, while two from ICICI Pru and Kotak said they would use exclusion strategy. In integration strategy, the fund considers ESG factors, along with financial ones, while deciding where to invest. On the other hand, those with exclusion strategy build portfolios by avoiding investments tied to certain ESG activities, business practices, or segments. Average performanceESG strategy is like a lion without claws as it has failed to boost the returns of ESG funds. Among the 20 equity fund categories, the ESG category with 33% absolute gain is ranked 16th in one-year time frame, while its 17.1% CAGR places it in a similar rank in the three-year time frame.In the one-year period, six out of eight actively managed ESG funds have lagged the benchmark Nifty 100 ESG Total Return Index. In the three-year period, four out of eight have shown underperformance. ESG funds from Quant and ICICI Pru have been notable exceptions to the category trend, but overall, the ESG fund category has underperformed simpler equity fund categories such as large-cap and flexi-cap baskets.From a portfolio standpoint, ESG funds are biased towards large-caps (55-79%). Except for Quant ESG’s concentrated portfolio (19 stocks), most funds have 40-55 stocks. The most frequently held stocks across ESG fund portfolios are ICICI Bank, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Maruti Suzuki, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance, RIL, HUL, and HCL Tech.ESG funds lagged largecap funds in past 3 years   109452148What explains ESG funds’ pedestrian returns? Top bank stocks and tech stocks have underperformed in the past year, causing a return drag, while some boost came from Maruti, Bharti, HCL Tech, Titan, Zomato, REC, L&T, TVS Motor, and Tata Motors.Experts say generating high returns from ESG portfolios could be a tough task in India if one were to stick to large caps. While US markets have hundreds of large caps, in India there are 100 large caps. “ESG funds add another layer of selection to choose ESG stocks as per their framework. This could leave them with a much smaller universe. In this situation, it’s all about assigning accurate weights to get outperformance,” says Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital.Other experts say the ESG theme could struggle due to premium valuations. “Themes such as ESG may find it difficult to beat broad market indices in some markets as the emphasis on ‘quality’ might mean holding stocks with a slightly premium valuation that can curtail the upside,” notes Vidya Bala, Co-Founder, PrimeInvestor.in.Due to portfolio positioning, most ESG funds haven’t been able to capture the market upsides in the last one- and three-year periods. However, the downside capture has been less than the market, staying true to expectations that firms scoring high in ESG offer a better cushion during declines.Investors should understand ESG data’s challenges and reporting. ESG scores aren’t mandatory and there’s no standardisation for formal disclosures. This gives rise to greenwashing examples, where some companies selectively disclose positive ESG practices while concealing negative aspects. This makes it challenging to gauge firms’ actual impact on ESG criteria and select them for fund portfolios. Hence, ESG theme investing is not for every investor, especially if your sole aim is high returns. Consider your goals, preferences and risk tolerance before going for ESG funds as they are yet to see a full market cycle.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//wealth/invest/esg-mutual-funds-why-these-mfs-may-not-be-the-right-choice-for-investors/articleshow/109452190.cms
INFOSYS,2024-04-21T17:01:00+05:30,Navdeep Singh,Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide stock action on Monday,"Indian benchmark equity indices defied global weakness to close higher on Friday, boosted by HDFC Bank, although the gains were not enough to prevent their first weekly loss in five on worries over the Middle East conflict and U.S. rates.","Indian benchmark equity indices defied global weakness to close higher on Friday, boosted by HDFC Bank, although the gains were not enough to prevent their first weekly loss in five on worries over the Middle East conflict and U.S. rates.The Nifty 50 rose 0.69% to 22,147, while the S&P BSE Sensex added 0.83% to 73,088, gaining for the first time this week. But they lost about 1.6% over the holiday-shortened week.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: Technically, the set-up is mildly negative at this point with Nifty below the crucial resistance zone of 22,300-350. A crossover beyond this area is required for the bulls to be back in the game. Any immediate closing above 22,300-350 levels should bring back fresh buying momentum. Support for Nifty is now seen at 22,000 and 21,700-800. On the higher side, the immediate resistance zone for Nifty is at 22,150-175 levels and the next crucial resistance zone is at 22,300-350 levels. Overall, the coming week should set up the market for a large trending move,  said Tejas Shah, JM Financial & BlinkX.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Looking ahead, bulls may drive Nifty's recovery towards 22,300. Furthermore, a decisive breakthrough above 22,300 could trigger a sustained rally towards 22,600. On the downside, support on a closing basis is situated at 22,000. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday's action:US marketThe Nasdaq and the S&P 500 ended lower on Friday as Netflix shares weighed, but American Express kept the Dow afloat after quarterly earnings from both companies, while growing pessimism that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon also dented sentiment.For the week, the S&P 500 fell 3.05%, the Nasdaq declined 5.52%, and the Dow climbed 0.01%. The S&P suffered its biggest weekly decline since March 2023 and the Nasdaq its largest since the week of October 31, 2022.European sharesEuropean stocks closed lower on Friday, but off their over one-month intraday low, as anxiety around escalating Middle East tensions seemed to ease, while French cosmetic giant L'Oreal logged its best day since early January after robust results.The continent-wide STOXX 600 closed 0.1% lower, but notching its biggest weekly decline of 1.2% since mid-January owing to renewed focus on geopolitical tensions that steered investors away from risky assets and a rout in technology stocks.Tech View: Bullish reversal patternNifty on Friday ended 151 points higher after four successive days of decline and formed a bullish reversal pattern on the daily chart.The psychological mark of 22,000 holds intermediate support, followed by strong support of the 21800-21700 subzone. On the higher end, the 20-DEMA placed at 22300, followed by a bearish gap of 22430-22500, is likely to act as a daunting task in the near period and an authoritative breakthrough could only re-strengthen the lost momentum to the bulls of D-Street, said Osho Krishan of Angel One.Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of Kalpataru Power, Linde India, JSPL, Chennai Petro, HUL, and Power Grid among others.The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.
