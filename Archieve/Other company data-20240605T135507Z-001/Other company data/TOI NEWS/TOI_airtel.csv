According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward.

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Despite the capital inf","Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report. The value of GQG’s stake in Adani stocks has grown about fivefold within a year, making these one of the many winning picks for the Florida-based investment firm in India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajiv-jains-gqg-to-invest-around-400-million-in-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109362179.cms

Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus.

Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms

According to a report by Economic Times, the aim is to boost participation in the upcoming rounds of voting, according to sources.EC sets 100 million per day targetThe ECI has proposed sending approximately 100 million text messages daily to engage voters, but telecom companies have expressed their inability to meet this demand, citing a maximum capacity of 20 million texts per day.Discussions between the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), ECI representatives, and telecom executives have been ongoing to reach an agreement on the volume of messages to be distributed.With the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1 and vote counting set for June 4, the plan is to dispatch these messages promptly, ideally before the third phase on May 7.Inquiries directed to the ECI, major telecom operators, and the DoT by ET have not received responses as of this writing.Low voter turnout may be behind EC's appealThe voter turnout for the first two phases on April 19 and April 26 was recorded at around 66%, a decrease from the 2019 elections. Experts suggest that higher-than-average temperatures in several states may have discouraged voter participation.While telecom companies have intermittently sent messages for the ECI, there is now a push to intensify this effort.Telecom firms, while not directly involved in election processes, play a crucial role in various digital operations. Their services have been utilized by the government during emergencies and significant events.The ECI has also increased its monitoring of SMS and voice call campaigns by political entities to maintain the integrity of the elections.ET reports that the commission is tracking campaign spending through various channels to ensure compliance with election expenditure caps. The ECI audits financial records to verify that candidates and parties adhere to the set limits of ₹70 lakh for Lok Sabha candidates and ₹40 lakh for assembly candidates, covering all campaign-related expenses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/election-commission-makes-a-voting-appeal-to-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea/articleshow/109755962.cms
airtel,2024-04-29T08:54:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Why Motilal Oswal's CIO is bullish on telecom stocks,"India Business News: India's telecommunications sector is poised for a resurgence, driven by anticipated tariff increases and the adoption of high-speed networks, which ar","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said. The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd, the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers. Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline. Mobile operators are urging the government to discontinue 2G services, aiming to cut network-related expenses and transition over 200 million users to higher data plans. Motilal Oswal’s Shah expects a full migration of all customers to 4G or 5G within the next two to three years. These price hikes, alongside the migration and lower interest burden, will drive profits in the coming years, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-motilal-oswals-cio-is-bullish-on-telecom-stocks/articleshow/109677229.cms

Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.5G rollout plans of Vodafone-IdeaAhead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being.

Other institutional investors are also expected to buy into the sale, they added.The $2.2 billion share sale, which will start on April 18 and close April 22, has a floor price of 10 rupees (12 cents) per share and a ceiling price of 11 rupees, the Mumbai based firm said in exchange filings last week. Representatives of Vodafone Idea and GQG Partners did not offer any immediate comments. A statement filed by the telecoms operator dated Tuesday showed several GQG funds are among a handful of investors that have subscribed to 54 billion rupees of shares.The backing from GQG is a major shot in the arm for Vodafone Idea. The telecom operator has been plagued by financial losses and an eroding subscriber base as users switched to stronger rivals, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd. While it hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2016, recent comments by the Indian government that it won’t allow a duopoly in the Indian telecom sector has bolstered investor hopes that Vodafone Idea will survive and stage a comeback.The Indian government emerged as Vodafone Idea’s largest shareholder in 2022 when the wireless operator converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the administration into a 36% stake. The smallest of India’s three private sector wireless operators, it has struggled to upgrade its infrastructure while Reliance Jio and Bharti have rapidly rolled out their 5G networks across the country, luring subscribers away.Jain’s GQG has been in the spotlight for investing in several Adani Group firms in March 2023, weeks after they were thrashed by a stinging short seller report.

airtel,2024-04-12T13:54:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel may increase mobile tariff by 15-17% post Lok Sabha election,"TECH NEWS : Antique Stock Broking anticipates a 15-17% telecom tariff hike post Lok Sabha elections, with Airtel's ARPU potentially reaching Rs 286 by FY27. Jio i","The country’s telecom industry may see a 15-plus tariff hike in the range of 15-17 percent following the Lok Sabha elections, according to a recent analysis by Antique Stock Broking, as reported by new agency PTI. The report, which terms the tariff increase as ""imminent,"" identifies Bharti Airtel as the biggest beneficiary of this move. The Lok Sabha elections are scheduled from April 19 to June 1.""We expect the industry to take a 15-17 per cent tariff hike post the elections,"" the analyst stated, highlighting the positive outlook for the telecom sector in the coming years.The report predicts that Airtel's current industry-leading ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Rs 208 will rise to Rs 286 by the end of FY27. This growth will be driven by several factors, including the expected tariff hike contributing Rs 55, the upgradation of 2G customers to 4G adding Rs 10, and customer upgradation to higher data plans (both 4G and 5G) and postpaid plans delivering an additional Rs 14.Airtel could record its best finances in over a decade""We expect Bharti's subscriber base to grow at about two per cent per annum, against the industry growth of one per cent per annum,"" the Antique Stock Broking added, emphasising Airtel's strong position in the market.The brokerage firm anticipates Airtel to experience its best financial performance in over a decade, driven by the tariff hike, 2G upgradation, robust growth in enterprise and Fibre-to-the-Home segments, and a decrease in capital expenditure following the 5G rollout.""While challenges do exist as Bharti has chosen a different 5G rollout path versus key competitors, we believe it is unlikely to dent Bharti's subscriber base or growth significantly,"" the brokerage firm noted, addressing potential concerns about Airtel's 5G strategy.Vodafone Idea, BSNL struggles with declining market shareThe report also highlights the declining market share of Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL, with the former struggling due to financial woes and the latter facing execution challenges. ""While Vodafone Idea is down from 37.2 per cent in September 2018 to almost half at 19.3 per cent in December 2023, Bharti's market share is up from 29.4 per cent to 33 per cent during this period. Jio is the biggest gainer rising from 21.6 per cent to 39.7 per cent,"" the report stated.

Vittal has called on all employees of the company, including senior executives, across India to cancel all business meetings on Tuesday and spend the entire day on the field with customers to get a fix on service challenges they face. The exercise is said to be part of a national brand-building drive to position Airtel as a customer-obsessed telco that is keen on eliciting direct market feedback from its target audience on the state of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile operations as well as home broadband services. This comes as Airtel is set to complete its pan-India 5G network roll out later this month. As of end-December 2023, the telco had 65 million pure 5G users.Vittal wrote an internal email communication to all Airtel employees regarding the same, here's the email that he sent:Dear FriendsI am looking forward to all of you participating with full energy in the Customer Day tomorrow.This is a very important day where we celebrate our front line staff who serve customers.

Shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd sold 75 million shares in the company at 570 rupees apiece last week, the top of a marketed range. The offering drew bids for more than 30 times the number of shares on offer. Trading begins at around 10 a.m. local time on Friday. Bharti Hexacon’s IPO is the country’s largest since Mankind Pharma Ltd raised 43.3 billion rupees a year ago. A strong start could help open a window for more large deals in India, dubbed by bankers as one of the hottest spots for first-time share sales in Asia this year.“Bharti Hexacom is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving market trends and consumer preferences,” said Rajan Shinde, Mumbai-based analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd.The offering may further boost activity in the equities market that has mainly been hosting IPOs smaller than $100 million in size over the past year. Those share sales drew a strong response from retail investors and surged after listing, drawing scrutiny by regulators concerned about market froth. In the past 12 months through Wednesday, only two offerings in India raised more than $500 million. Companies that went public in India over the past five years after IPOs larger than $500 million rose 7.5% on average on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with a 32% increase for similar listings in Asia Pacific over the same period. Bharti Hexacom, a unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd, provides fixed-line telephone and broadband services in two circles in India that make up about 7% of industry customers, according to the prospectus. SBI Capital Markets, Axis Capital, BOB Capital Markets, ICICI Securities and IIFL Securities are the lead managers to the sale.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bharti-hexacom-set-to-debut-after-indias-biggest-ipo-in-a-year/articleshow/109231285.cms
airtel,2024-04-12T07:13:00+05:30,TOI Tech Desk,Airtel-backed company: Reliance Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by ...,TECH NEWS : Reliance Jio and Bharti Group clash over satellite spectrum usage for internet services in remote areas of India. Eutelsat OneWeb aims for a business-,"There's a brewing battle between Reliance Jio and Bharti Group over how satellite spectrum should be used to deliver internet services in remote areas of India. The key point of contention is whether Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb should be allowed to leverage administratively allocated spectrum, without auctions, for commercial fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb has reportedly rejected Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite spectrum can’t be used for offering commercial FWA services merely since it is a 5G use case.“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive told Economic Times.Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.Reliance Jio argues that this approach gives Bharti Airtel-backed Eutelsat OneWeb an unfair advantage. Eutelsat OneWeb counters that their services differ significantly from Jio's 5G-based FWA aimed at millions of users. They plan to target remote locations, businesses, and government agencies with a business-to-business model. Jio maintains this distinction is irrelevant and insists all satellite FWA spectrum should be auctioned.Both companies see immense potential in this market. Eutelsat OneWeb aims to be the first global satellite internet provider in India, while Jio seeks to avoid losing ground in this new frontier. The Indian government's decision on how to allocate and price commercial satellite spectrum will likely determine the outcome of this clash.Government may not allot satcom airwaves in a rushThe government on its part is said to be in no hurry to allot spectrum to satcom companies like Bharti-backed Eutelsat Oneweb and Reliance Jio’s satellite venture, damping the hopes of an early roll out of services by the companies that have been pushing for a quick allotment, even if on a temporary basis.“It will take a few months to finalise how we must move forward. If required, views of the regulator will be sought, and we may also undertake some consultation with the stakeholders,” one of the senior DoT officials told ET.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-backed-company-reliance-jio-is-unnecessarily-trying-to-confuse-matters-by-/articleshow/109230756.cms
