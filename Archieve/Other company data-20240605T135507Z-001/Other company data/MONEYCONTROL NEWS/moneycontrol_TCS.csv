TCS,2024-04-22T16:35:02+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"How generative AI deals stack up for Accenture, TCS, Infosys, Wipro","With Accenture reporting $1.1 billion in revenue from generative AI and TCS seeing a $900-million deal pipeline, Infosys and Wipro settled for seeing strong traction in generative AI deals in Q4.","The fourth quarter IT earnings saw Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) close in on Accenture as it announced a generative AI deal pipeline worth $900 million. Rivals Infosys and Wipro, however, continued to shy away from divulging numbers despite a strong commentary on generative AI demand.  Investors were scanning for Gen AI-related announcements in the earnings fineprint of IT companies, even as the entire sector struggled with the ongoing slowdown in discretionary spend by IT services clients, macroeconomic headwinds and the burden of expectations set by Accenture's generative AI deal updates. But did the companies deliver?  Accenture  The company is in the middle of deploying $3 billion into building its AI capabilities. It also plans to upskill about 250,000 of its workforce in AI. Last month, Accenture said they are seeing robust interest for generative AI, with cumulative revenues of $1.1 billion during the first two quarters (Accenture follows September-August financial year).  TCS   On April 12, TCS shared that it has $900-million worth of generative AI and AI projects in the pipeline. At the TCS earnings call, CEO K Krithivasan had said, “Subsequent to our launch of AI.Cloud unit, we are seeing an increased traction in our marketplace. We have won more than 200 engagements in AI so far this year.”  “The number of engagements going into production is steadily increasing. Our AI and Gen AI pipeline has doubled in the quarter to $900 million,” he added.  Moreover, post earnings, in a letter to employees, Krithivasan highlighted that TCS has one of the largest AI-ready workforces. TCS has so far trained around 350,000 of its employees in AI skills.  Infosys  While Infosys did not share exact deal numbers or the pipeline size, CEO and MD Salil Parekh said that the company’s Gen AI practice is “industry leading.”  “The type of work we are doing, for instance, the 3 million lines of codes we have generated through large language models in generative AI is absolutely industry leading,” Parekh had said on April 18. Parekh added that nearly eight out of 10 of Infosys employees are now skilled in AI.  Infosys had last updated that it had 50 active generative AI client projects in the pipeline, back in June 2023.  Wipro  The company is in the middle of an overhaul under new CEO Srinivas Pallia, who said that industry-specific offerings and business solutions, mainly on consulting businesses, which can be infused with artificial intelligence (AI) will be one of the key strategies in a five-pointer business turnaround plan for the company.  Wipro will continue to build AI-ready talent at scale. This workforce will be trained to deliver industry-specific business solutions, Pallia said. So far, Wipro has trained about 225,000 employees in generative AI skilled.  In July 2023, Wipro had earmarked about $1 billion to invest into expanding its AI capabilities and business.  Gen AI changing hiring models, driving efficiency  One interesting narrative that emerged in Q4FY24 was companies, including Infosys and Wipro, talked about how generative AI and internal automation will be key levers in improving operating margins as well as chalking out hiring plan for FY25.  Wipro reported a second consecutive year of losing employees in FY24, after its headcount for the full year went down by 24,516. The hiring models too are fast changing, according to Wipro's HR chief Saurabh Govil.  Govil said that headcount reduction was mainly driven by demand environment as well as operational efficiencies, which have been reflected in the company's increased margins.  In the longer term, with AI taking centre-stage and as the company moves into more IP-based platforms AI, there could be a divergence coming, more and more in terms of headcount, Govil added.  &quot;But we still need to look at our entire portfolio, a large amount of work which we do with our clients, so it's a combination of both (demand and tech changes) as we move forward, and that it will evolve over a period of time,&quot; he said.  A similar commentary was found at Infosys’ analyst conference for Q4 earnings. While speaking of levers in place to achieve a 20-22 percent operating margin in FY25, CFO Jayesh Sanghrajka said, “On the GenAI and automation, we have done a lot of progress and we are doubling down on that. So I think all of those are baked in, in the current guidance of 20-22 percent. But our endeavor is, continues to improve operating margin in the mid-term.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/generative-ai-deals-accenture-tcs-infosys-wipro-12694221.html

TCS was earlier following a hybrid work model post pandemic, which it ended from October 1, 2023, asking employees to work from office five days a week.

This comes at a time when the company posted three consecutive quarters of headcount decline, and for the first time in 19 years since it got listed, TCS’ full-year headcount for FY24 plunged by 13,249.  Explaining the divergence between slowing headcount despite a strong deal pipeline and steady revenue growth, Krithivasan said, “We look at the trainees we deploy, we put them through our own internal training mechanisms and maybe after a period of 6 to 8 months, they become productive and billable. So, there will always be a lag.”  “In FY25, we will be hiring a very similar number of freshers like we did the year before,” he added.  In terms of hiring experienced professionals, TCS will be taking a call on a quarterly basis depending on immediate demand and requirement, Krithivasan said.  Moneycontrol had earlier reported that TCS is already on its way to hire 10,000 freshers for FY25, as it has begun fresher hiring via its National Qualifier Test (NQT) across top engineering colleges.  Krithivasan said he won’t read much into the full year and quarterly headcount decline in the fourth quarter ended March 31, as it’s only about a 1.5 percent drop in the overall headcount as against a revenue growth of about 3.2 percent YoY in constant currency terms.  “It's not a great divergence, which is compensated for by the productivity gains that we have been working at. And there's always a lag between when you hire people and when they get deployed also. So, I do not read too much into the headcount reduction,” he said.  Meanwhile, TCS’ attrition rate too had continued to slow down. Attrition for the quarter fell to 12.5 percent, continuing its downward trend from last quarter’s 13.3 percent. The company expects further correction in attrition levels in the upcoming quarters.

Given its greater experience than peers in implementing large, complex, and mission-critical projects, the company is a serious contender for large deals. Moreover, it has a global presence, deep domain expertise in various industries and offerings in digital transformation services, cloud, cognitive business operations, etc, they said.  &quot;A portfolio of turnkey services offerings, traction in emerging markets, ability to roll up, improving sales and marketing prowess, and willingness to take multiple big bets (different go-to-market models) are among the key drivers that should help TCS sustain its hi-growth trajectory in the long run,&quot; said Nuvama as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 4,560 per share.  Nirmal Bang remained ‘underweight’ on the IT sector and maintained a ‘sell’ call on TCS due to its rich valuation. The brokerage believes that TCS is in a ‘slower for longer’ kind of a scenario.  &quot;While we believe TCS can deliver steady growth, the best margins, strong ROICs and cash flows in the Tier-1 space, US$ growth beyond FY26 will settle at 5-7 percent CAGR,&quot; it said.

But what is also happening at the same time is our clients reprioritising some of the old engagements. So during FY22 or prior to that, whatever engagements we started, some of them are getting reprioritised in terms of what is the capacity we put on those programs.  Let’s say a program is supposed to have delivered 20 different functionalities. The customers look at the first five functionalities that have been delivered. They have got the value. Maybe the remaining 15 functionalities are not very important, or they don’t deliver as much value. Then the client decides that they can either wait or not proceed with the rest of the program.  So, all of those decisions are being taken which results in reduction in people deployed or the amount of work to be delivered to the customers in some of those old programmes, which net-net means that the overall revenue growth is not consistent with new project wins.  But again, as we said yesterday, we believe FY25 would be better than FY24 because that kind of  reprioritisation in the old programs may also improve. This is because given the fact that it’s been happening for a year and we continue to win new programmes, we see us have a better FY25 compared to FY24.  You have delivered superior margins of 26%-- but with utilisation at record highs, sub-contracting costs at record lows, and wage hikes kicking in, how much wiggle room will you have going forward to maintain this or further take this up? There will also be pass through costs from BSNL?  See, the most important lever you forgot is pricing. We have also not improved our pricing, like we believe there is a greater opportunity to increase it.  So, the pricing is one of the most important levers we should continue to focus on. We have not had a significant increase in the last few quarters. But leave aside pricing, on utilization, we are used to operating almost close to 90 percent. So, I still believe there is some headroom left on utilisation. And similarly, we can also further tweak our employee pyramid. Even with all that, there will be some projects where we may not be operating in the most efficient way. So, we look for efficiencies where we can deploy our people better.  A combination of all these things would still help us. See, we have been giving 26 percent to 28 percent as our guiding beacon (for margin). I think that would give us the headroom for improving it further.  Where do you see these price hikes coming?  We are not talking about huge price hikes. We are talking about marginal corrections where we have not had corrections in a long while. If you look at the Indian market, our prices are probably more or less stable for a long period of time, whereas inflation has continued to go up. So, we would be looking for opportunities where we can price our services better by having a better portfolio mix. So, you need to adjust your overall project portfolio mix so that your pricing also improves.  So, how does the expected price hikes compare between the upcoming deal renewals and new customers coming in?   We may not be able to increase the price just because it's a deal renewal. The price will go up with a better product mix. So, we must be very conscious of the product mix to improve the pricing. Deal renewal by itself may not help you.  Headcount declined 0.3% QOQ or by 1,759 to 601,546, marking the third straight quarter of net headcount decline. TCS full year net headcount declines for first time in 19 years. Headcount has lagged revenue growth for the second year in FY2024. Will we see this non-linearity continue?  The headcount reduction for the whole year is about 10,000 people. It's just about 1.5 percent of our overall headcount. So, it's not as if our revenue went up for the year, like you said, maybe about 3 - 3.5%, headcount went down by about 1.5%.  It's not a great divergence, which is compensated for by the productivity gains that we have been working at. And there's always a lag between when you hire people and when they get deployed also. So, I do not read too much into the headcount reduction.  We look at the trainees we deploy, we put them through our own internal training mechanisms and maybe after a period of 6 to 8 months, they become productive and billable. So, there will always be a lag. Into FY25, we will be hiring a very similar number of freshers like we did the year before.  But based on immediate demand we will try to change the number of experienced professionals we hire. That decision we take on a quarterly basis.  And the third factor is attrition. Attrition is coming down. So, these three factors will determine whether we have a net headcount addition or reduction. I do not want to say at this time there will be an addition, but we are committed on the trainee intake. We honour the offers that we make.  Where is the $900 million Gen AI pipeline majorly coming from? Will the same pace of growth continue and how pricing different for Gen AI deals?  More and more of our customers are looking at opportunities. We are working with our customers to see in their value chain where generative AI can deliver more value to them. We go to them with new propositions to discuss how they can deploy it better. Since it’s a new technology $900 million as the pipeline, it is a small number. So, it has enough headroom to double or grow further. I do not want to say double every quarter, but enough headroom to grow very well.  The pricing again, since I talked about product mix, these are all some of the new technologies. So, the pricing will obviously be better than the traditional technologies.  Krithi, when do you see double digit growth returning to TCS?  I will let you know once I see it (laughs).  Are you feeling better about FY25 versus FY24? Will FY26 be better than FY25? I just want to know if the worst is over and the green shoots are visible now?  We believe FY25 is likely to be a better year than FY24. FY26, I do not want to call it this time. But otherwise, we are feeling better about FY25.  You have spoken at length about regional markets like Middle East, India, LATAM showing tremendous growth potential although revenue contribution is still low?  We do want to ensure these markets (regional) contribute to our revenue in a material way. Currently, it is a small number. We want to ensure that they contribute to our revenue in a material way and rightfully because these markets are growing quite well, and they are not under the same kind of growth pressure as the major markets. We have very good offerings and solutions in these markets and our success rates have also been very good. So, we want to focus more on these markets.   It was clearly an India shining story for you based on the BSNL numbers. And I think it is going to continue in the current fiscal as well. Analysts are expecting $700-800 million alone to come from that deal. How is that going to trend going forward? And secondly, as you complete your first year as CEO, how is it going? Any changes we can expect from an organization perspective?  From a BSNL perspective, I don't want to say what would be the revenue coming in every quarter. As we implement more and more towers, activate more and more of them, the revenue from the deal keeps increasing. We look at it as a nation building project. So, we don't look at primarily only the revenue, we look at how we are enabling the nation to get a new indigenous digital stack on 4G, 5G.  As far as me completing one year, it's been a great year for me, a lot of support from our customers, as well as our associates and the leadership team. We made some tweaks last year, we'll continue to make tweaks as we think that's necessary to react to the market situation. But I'm not looking at any major changes or restructuring going forward.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/there-is-a-greater-opportunity-to-increase-pricing-tcs-ceo-k-krithivasan-12638611.html

Speaking to the media at TCS’ Q4 earnings conference on April 12, Krithivasan said, “Subsequent to our launch of AI.Cloud unit, we are seeing an increased traction in our marketplace. We have won more than 200 engagements in AI so far this year.”  “The number of engagements going into production is steadily increasing. Our AI and Gen AI pipeline has doubled in the quarter to $900 million,” he added.  Krithivasan maintained that these engagements continue to be smaller projects.  Last month, Accenture had announced that they are seeing robust interest on generative AI, with cumulative revenues of $1.1 billion during the first two quarters (Accenture follows September-August financial year). It won Gen AI deals worth $600 million in the second quarter.  In February, at the Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum (NTLF) 2024 in Mumbai, Krithivasan had said, “Generative AI in most places is being used for experimentations and PoCs (proof of concepts), it is too early to call it mainstream or say it is causing reduction in workforce. That’s not true.”  He had also added that AI and generative AI won’t lead to reduction in hiring or job displacement, it will only change the way the IT services giant is training its employees.  TCS reported its Q4FY24 earnings on April 12. Net profit grew by 9 percent YoY at Rs 12,434 crore. Revenue for the quarter rose 3.5 percent to Rs 61,237 crore in the three months ended March 31.  For the full year of FY24, revenue grew by by 6.8 percent YoY to Rs 240,893 crore. Net profit for the year was at Rs 46,585 crore, growing 10.5 percent YoY.

This is historically the highest full-year order book for the IT services giant","India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on April 12 reported that its deal total contract value (TCV) for the fourth quarter ended March 31 came in at $13.2 billion, an all-time high. This was despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and an ongoing slowdown in discretionary spending.  On a full-year basis, the order book was up at $42.7 billion as compared to $34.1 billion recorded in FY23. This is historically the highest full-year order book for the IT services giant.  This was mainly led by growth in geographies including India which grew at over 37.9 percent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms and UK that grew by 6.2 percent in CC terms.  Among verticals, growth was led by manufacturing, which grew by 9.7 percent YoY in CC in Q4. BFSI, which accounts for nearly 35-40 percent of the company's revenue, continued to see a slowdown, degrowing 3.2 percent YoY in Q4 in CC terms. Even technology &amp;amp; services, communication and media, and consumer business has seen a negative growth.  Core market North America also continues to see pressure, as growth declined by 2.3 percent CC YoY. Continental Europe declined by 2 percent YoY in CC.  TCS won several multi-year multi-million dollar deals in Q4, from Aviva, Ramboll and the Central Bank in the US, to name a few.  While TCS didn’t disclose the deal size yet, according to a report by Mint, the 15-year Aviva deal could be worth $2.5 billion.  N Ganapathy Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director, said, “Our Q4 performance is robust, with broad based deal wins across industries and geographies. Our products and platforms business sparkled with the mega deal win at Aviva and emerging markets had another stellar growth quarter demonstrating the power of TCS’ diversified portfolio.”  Mega deals for TCS refers to deal sizes of over $500 million.  K Krithivasan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, added, “In an environment of global macro uncertainty, we are staying close to our customers and helping them execute on their core priorities with TCS’ portfolio of offerings, innovation capabilities and thought leadership.”  The company is also benefitting from the revenue coming in from the $1.8-billion BSNL deal, which is getting reflected in the India growth.

TCS,2024-04-10T15:24:49+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS Q4FY24 earnings preview: Top five factors at play,"TCS' Q4 revenue is expected to be around Rs 60,559 cr, seen flat QoQ while Net profit is estimated at Rs 11,739 cr, higher by 6.16% QoQ.","This has been quite a year for India's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). From getting a new CEO, undergoing a structural change, adding new verticals like cloud and AI, to becoming AI-first in identity, all this happened in a tough business environment that saw delayed deal closures, persisting macroeconomic challenges and inflationary pressures.  As markets await results for the fourth quarter on April 12, five key themes will be closely watched in the management commentary by TCS.  Revenue Growth  According to Moneycontrol’s estimates, revenue for the quarter is expected to be around Rs 60,559 crores, growing 2.36 percent YoY and remained flat sequentially.  Net profit is estimated to come in at Rs 11,739 crores, a 3.05 percent jump YoY and 6.16 percent increase sequentially.  Among Tier-I IT companies, TCS will be the best positioned drive revenue growth. “TCS, aided by BSNL deal ramp, will likely lead the growth,” said a Jefferies report.  The company’s EBIT margins or operating margins are expected to remain flat in Q4FY24 at 25 percent, as per Moneycontrol’s estimates. Analysts at Sharekhan expect some improvement for TCS on the margin front this quarter driven by better utilisation and lower sub-contracting expenses, offsetting lower margins from BSNL deal.  Demand Outlook  While TCS has not reported any mega deals this quarter, it did bag a bunch of multi-year, multi-million dollar deals from Aviva, Ramboll and the Central Bank in the US, to name a few. Overall, analysts are expecting a good order book.  Mega deals for TCS refers to deal sizes of over $500 million.  However, as per a report by Mint, the 15-year Aviva contract could be of around $2.5 billion, TCS' biggest deal ever.  TCS moved away from its previous guided range of $9-10 billion in Q3FY24, but managed to clock in $8.1 billion in order book without a mega deal.  Last quarter, TCS reported a slowdown in its BFSI vertical which accounts for nearly 35-40 percent of the company’s revenue. Geographically, TCS’ core market North America too had declined in growth. Whether these areas have started showing any recovery and comments on revival of discretionary spending will be closely tracked.  “Despite the elongated deal cycle due to the macro-overhang, the deal TCV over 9MFY24 is robust at $29.5 billion. We believe the ramp-ups of deals with JLR, BSNL, Nest and Aviva should contribute strongly to the company’s revenue growth recovery in FY25,” the Sharekhan report said.  Hiring Plans and Furloughs  Last quarter, TCS’ headcount dropped by 5,680 on a net basis. This was the second consecutive quarter of headcount decline for the company while it maintained that it is on track to hire 40,000 freshers as planned for FY24.  Analysts said that the reversal of furloughs in Q4FY24 will aide TCS’ business.  TCS had reported steady decline in attrition rate to 13.3 percent last quarter on LTM (last twelve-month) basis. CHRO Milind Lakkad had said while this is a comfortable range, he does expect it to go down further.  TCS’ plans for hiring in FY25 will be looked out for. Though in FY24 there were delays in campus hiring, the company has already announced fresher hiring tests for FY25.  Generative AI Plans  TCS had over 250 generative AI projects in the pipeline. Though customers are now getting comfortable with the technology and expect some proof of concepts (PoCs) to move to production, the project sizes have been smaller, Krithivasan had said last quarter during the earnings call.  Meanwhile, rival Accenture has been sharing bigger than ever revenue and numbers on generative AI deals. As of the December-February quarter, Accenture added $600 million in generative AI deals. This is in addition to another $450 million worth of generative AI deals it previously won.  How FY25 will play out for TCS in terms of the next phase of generative AI plans will be interesting to watch out.  Commentary on FY25 Growth  Though it’s a stable company, TCS is also navigating the ongoing AI boom as it looks to fortify its AI strategy, help customers with finding generative AI use cases, train employees etc. This fiscal year, the company aims to expand business in some of its in-demand and newer segments including semiconductors, EVs and AI as well.  Earlier in an interview Moneycontrol, CEO K Krithivasan had said that he expects FY25 to be better than FY24. He had also said that budgets are no longer sacrosanct as customers are ready to re-calibrate depending on opportunities.  “We expect IT firms to be cautious on FY25 guidance given that most missed their initial guidance range in FY24 and recent guidance ranges from overseas peers suggest the demand environment remains subdued,” analysts at Jefferies said in the report.

TCS,2024-04-03T14:35:59+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"Digital twins, chip design, AI solutions: Inside TCS' big semiconductor bet","Here’s how Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is making the best of the booming semiconductor opportunity. Semiconductor business is expected to bring higher margins by around 200-300 bps as compared to IT services, expert said.","From deploying AI, internet of things (IoT) solutions, semiconductor research and development (R&amp;amp;D), chip designing and  testing and validating chips, India's largest software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), is  offering end-to-end semiconductor solutions to its customers, a top company executive told Moneycontrol.  TCS is also working with the Tata Group.  Tata Group is currently gearing up to set up semiconductor manufacturing in India in partnership with Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (PSMC), driving a whopping cumulative investment of over Rs 1.18 lakh crore across its fabrication plant in Dholera, Gujarat; and assembly, testing and packaging (ATP) plant in Morigaon, Assam.  The Dholera plant is expected to produce 50,000 wafers per month and the Morigaon plant will be able to package and produce 48 million chips per day. Wafers are circular flat plate-like silicon structures from which chips are cut out.  There is also an upcoming pilot project facility in Bengaluru, where design prototyping work will be done, which then goes into fabrication, assembling and packaging.  Semiconductor design and AI are among TCS’ key emerging areas, where it expects to scale up business. While peers such as Accenture, Infosys, HCLTech and Tech Mahindra, among others, too are betting big on semiconductor R&amp;amp;D and has each acquired smaller companies to strengthen their capabilities in this space, TCS has built its team and these capabilities in house over the past couple of decades.  After focusing on semiconductor R&amp;amp;D, the next milestone for TCS will be to perfect its chip design capabilities and solutions, said Reguraman Ayyaswamy, Senior Vice President and Global Head of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Engineering, TCS, in an interview to Moneycontrol.  The chip designing process involves defining product requirements for the chip’s architecture and systems. It will also include planning the physical layout of the chip’s individual circuits and transistors.  According to Ayyaswamy, the chip design process and tools are currently going through tremendous transformation. “This is because you're now trying to build AI not on the software, but on the chip itself,” he said.  Speaking of the on-going work with the Tata Group, Ayyaswamy said, “As part of the ER&amp;amp;D work, TCS is involved in System on Chip (SoC) design activities. This is an emerging area with IoT and AI on the edge. TCS will, in addition to the design activities, potentially leverage Tata Group companies in electronics that offer end-to-end value chain covering assembly &amp;amp; testing and foundry manufacturing in the future.”  Without naming specific companies, he added that TCS has been working with many of the major global chipmakers over the years and helping them in VLSI (very large scale integration), analog and digital chip design, and setting up technical innovation centres.  Stages of collaboration on chip manufacturing  Not just on R&amp;amp;D and designing of the chips, TCS will be involved in the Tata Group project from the planning stages as well, as it looks to deploy IoT solutions driven by AI capabilities that will be integrated into the manufacturing plant from the construction level itself.  Ayyaswamy explained that bringing Industry 4.0 and AI-led manufacturing at the early stages itself will reduce human intervention and also help the plant get notified on any irregularity expected in the machinery weeks prior.  Beyond the foundry processes of front end design engineering, logic design verification etc., TCS will be actively working on the assembly and testing phase by providing infrastructure for machines, test cases and validation services using simulation to check the chip’s quality.  Even as this project helps TCS build the entire suite of semiconductor-related services, it will be looking to offer the same to existing and newer external customers as well.  According to Pareekh Jain, Founder and CEO of industry insights platform EIIRTrend, similar to other ER&amp;amp;D services, the semiconductor business will bring higher margins, by 200-300 bps, for TCS as compared to pure play IT services business.  Jain added, “At present, out of the overall $80 billion spent every year on semiconductor R&amp;amp;D by global chipmakers, about $1.5-2 billion goes to outsourced R&amp;amp;D services. With the increased demand for chip manufacturing, outsourced semiconductor R&amp;amp;D spends are poised to reach $5-10 billion over the next six years while overall R&amp;amp;D spend by chipmakers will grow to $100 billion.”  Using Gen AI to balance skill requirements  With the sudden increase in demand for semiconductors, there has been a shortage of niche talent building core products too, Ayyaswamy said. TCS has partnered with educational institutions and tied up with partner companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm, to name a few, to help with skilling.  “The readily available talent is not high, because it's an emerging area. Through academic collaborations, we are getting some very good quality young people. And then we give them a garage-type of setting where they can come and work like a nerd, try new LLMs (large language models) and do some high performance compute work with algorithms,” he said.  He added, “There’s also a lot more interaction going on with the partners be it Nvidia, Intel, or hyperscalars, like AWS, we have very intense interactions with them on the products that they will make, that essentially will apply in a domain context. And how we can really use that domain context etc.”  The company is interestingly also leveraging generative AI to reduce dependence of skilled talent.  “Generative AI is able to allow a chip designer to do the right level of packaging, right level of decision making. So, we see how we can use generative AI to probably notch down the skill sets that are required, which will help design those chips much faster.”  Also read: Indian EVs were blowing up because of cheap laptop chips in battery: NXP tech chief Lars Reger",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/digital-twins-chip-design-ai-solutions-how-tcs-is-powering-tatas-semiconductor-business-12567121.html

On the downside, support levels are positioned at 21,800 and 21,700.","The Nifty has experienced breakdown from a rising channel on the daily chart, signalling the conclusion of the previous uptrend and the potential beginning of a downtrend. This breakdown is supported by the moving average as well, the index has dipped below the crucial near-term moving average, and the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA).  Additionally, the index has skidded below the recent consolidation phase on the daily timeframe, further emphasising the increasing weakness. The relative strength index (RSI) with a period of 14 is showing a bearish crossover and has dropped below the 50 mark.  In the short term, the index may continue to be susceptible to selling pressure with likely resistance around 22,250. On the downside, support levels are seen at 21,800 and 21,700.  Meanwhile, the bears retained control in the banking space as the index encountered rejection at the 47,500 level, solidifying it as a formidable resistance zone. The index persists in a 'sell on rise' stance until this resistance is convincingly surpassed on a closing basis.  Breaching its 20-day moving average (20DMA) implies a subsequent wave of selling pressure, potentially pushing the index down towards the 46,000-45,500 range.  Here is one buy call and two sell recommendations for short term:  Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,729.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,700 | Target: Rs 1,800 | Return: 4 percent  After a few days of weakness, the stock has closed with a Bullish Harami pattern (not a classic one) on the daily chart, indicating a potential bullish reversal. Additionally, the stock has recently closed above the near-term moving average on the daily chart, further affirming the bullish trend.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily timeframe shows a bullish crossover. Hence for the short term, the stock looks positive.  A decisive move above Rs 1,735 could propel the stock into a short-term rally, potentially reaching Rs 1,800. Support on the lower end is situated at Rs 1,700, below which the stock may resume its decline.    Tata Consultancy Services: Sell | LTP: Rs 4,149 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,200 | Target: Rs 4,000/3,970 | Return: 4 percent  The stock has formed a Dark Cloud Cover pattern on the daily timeframe, indicating a potential bearish reversal following a rally. Additionally, the price has retreated into consolidation after breaking out from a previous consolidation phase.  The RSI is on the brink of a bearish crossover. The decline in price was accompanied by significant volume, suggesting broad-based participation in the selling pressure.  Therefore, in the short term, the outlook for the stock appears negative. A decisive move below Rs 4,130 could push the stock towards the levels of Rs 4,000/3,970. Resistance on the upper end is positioned at Rs 4,200, beyond which the stock may resume its upward movement.    REC: Sell | LTP: Rs 448.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 460 | Target: Rs 425 | Return: 5 percent  The stock has fallen sharply after a consolidation on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in weakness. The decline in price was accompanied by significant volume, suggesting broad-based participation in the selling pressure. Besides, the stock found resistance at the previous swing high before the recent fall.  The RSI is in a bearish crossover. Therefore, in the short term, the outlook for the stock appears negative.  A decisive move below Rs 448 could push the stock towards the levels of Rs 425. Resistance on the upper end is positioned at Rs 460, beyond which the stock may resume its upward movement.

Nifty Smallcap 100 index fell more than the benchmark as the advance-decline ratio fell to 0.24:1 on the NSE.  The Nifty closed below its 5-DMA (day moving average). In the derivatives, Nifty Open Interest Put call ratio fell sharply as we have seen aggressive Call writing at the 22,400-22,500 levels. Moreover, triple tops have been formed around 22,500 levels during last three days suggesting that 22,400-22,500 level would be a very strong resistance on an upswing.  Traders are advised to book profit in long positions and wait for the Nifty to close above 22,500 levels for creating fresh longs.  On the downside, recent swing low of 22,269 to act as an immediate support. Any close below 22,269 would result into bearish trend reversal which could drag Nifty towards next support of 21,800-21,850 levels.  There is a negative divergence in stocks above 200 DMA against Nifty500 Index. The trend in the Nifty Smallcap Index turned bearish as it has closed below its important short-term moving averages. Therefore, we expect smallcaps to underperform Nifty in the short term.

FMCG stocks are expected to outperform in the coming weeks.    REC: Buy | LTP: Rs 484 | Stop-Loss: Rs 460 | Target: Rs 515, 540 | Return: 12 percent  The stock price has broken out on the daily chart from the downward sloping trendline, adjoining the highs of February 8, and March 6 with higher volumes.  Primary trend of the stock is positive as stock price is trading above important short and long term moving averages. Oscillators like RSI (11) and MFI (10) are sloping upwards and placed above 60 on the daily chart, indicating strength in the stock.  Tata Consultancy Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,122 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,950 | Target Rs 4,330, 4,450 | Return: 8 percent  The stock price has broken out on the monthly chart by surpassing the multiple top resistance of Rs 4,000 odd levels.

His comments come weeks after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, during his India visit, said that job displacement is a given whenever a new technology comes in to play.  Speaking at the Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum (NTLF) 2024 in Mumbai, Krithivasan said, “Generative AI in most places is being used for experimentations and PoCs (proof of concepts), it is too early call it mainstream or say it is causing reduction in workforce. That’s not true.”  “With every new technology we will see some disruption, eventually we will be able to do more work. Our planning doesn’t go with the assumption that we need to reduce hiring. We don’t see the demand for hiring going down but we will probably change the way we train people. And the kind of people we hire will also change but we don’t see this impacting our headcount,” he added.  He said that it is too early to decouple demand and hiring, despite a declining headcount at TCS amid a tough business environment. “Many of the organisations hired ahead of the curve, and as the demand stabilised we started using our bench,” he said.  Krithivasan said that while generative AI is increasing the productivity of the middle group of employees, for the employees who are trained to gather requirements, do the designs or where critical thinking is required, machines need to be validated and focus on creating superior user experience in needed — talent demand won’t go away very quickly.  “We will continue to require critical thinking, ability of strategic planning and creativity. It won’t go away. That we will probably need more people to be good at,” he said mentioning the kind of skills people need to be trained in.

He added that almost 65 percent of its associates are going to the office 3-5 days a week.  Krithivasan at NTLF said collaboration and building camaraderie are very important at TCS. The company’s values are very important.  “Around 30-40 percent of employees joined the last two to three years, if they don’t come to office they won’t learn those values,” he said.  “When we look back at our careers, of course, we got a lot of training and opportunities, but the most important learnings came from seeing how the mentors and seniors behaved in a given situation and learning how they tackled certain client situations. That can only be done by observing regularly,” he said.

TCS was responsible for running the online tests for the university at its affiliated test centres, and had entered into this partnership last year. This comes at a time when IT companies are already reeling under the impact of macroeconomic uncertainties and slower demand cycles.  In a letter addressed to the teachers and exam officers, Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Education at the university, Professor Martin Williams said, “I wrote to you last year following the technical problems experienced by some schools and colleges, test centres and candidates undertaking Oxford’s online admissions tests, which were delivered by a new provider, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).  Since then, we have undertaken a detailed review of the issues to better understand how and why these occurred and taken on board the expert and valuable feedback many of you shared. The decision has subsequently been taken to end our relationship with TCS.”  Williams mentioned on the university website, that following the review, the university’s team was able to understand better “how and why these (issues) occurred.”  The university is now working on finding alternative options for 2024 and beyond. The details of the arrangements will be communicated soon with the aim of starting new admission cycle in early Spring.  TCS had announced the partnership with the university in April 2023. TCS iON was deployed to design the admission tests for Oxford University which includes CAT, HAT, ELAT, MAT, MLAT, PAT, AMELAT, and the Philosophy test.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/oxford-university-ends-partnership-with-tcs-citing-technical-problems-in-online-admission-tests-12110591.html
TCS,2024-01-15T13:57:53+05:30,Nandita Khemka,"After Q3 numbers, TCS edges out Infosys as a near-term pick: Apurva Prasad","Even as IT stocks defy seasonality with strong performances, the HDFC Securities vice president for institutional research says the Tata Group company has scope for sustained outperformance.","Shares of information technology companies have been on a roll after the big names sprang a positive surprise in the third quarter. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Tech and Wipro topped margins estimates despite the seasonality factor. With a 6 percent quarterly growth in constant currency revenues, HCL Tech managed to outshine its peers.  For the sector as a whole, healthy deal wins and a drop in the employee attrition rate were the other highlights of the quarter. Management commentaries further contributed to the optimistic outlook, with TCS suggesting a potential turnaround in the BFSI or banking, financial services and insurance segment and anticipated growth in the upcoming quarter. Wipro's leadership has also signalled green shoots in discretionary demand.  But what does the pecking order look like following the better-than-expected quarterly showing? In an interview with Moneycontrol, Apurva Prasad, vice president, institutional research, HDFC Securities, says he prefers tech bellwether TCS over Infosys as it is poised to continue its outperformance in the coming quarters. Edited excerpts:  The big four have reported their numbers. The trend has been set as Q3 earnings have beaten muted expectations. So looking at the top four, which one is emerging //emerged// as a clear winner in Q3? Would you say it's HCL Tech given the fact that it has reported industry-beating revenue growth?  Yes, we were expecting HCL Tech to outperform in the quarter and they seem to have done that, but in the services space the outperformance is not very significant. But in any case, it sets up the company for an outperformance in FY24 and this outperformance should also likely continue in FY25. So HCL Tech, I would say, would be the best out of the top four.  TCS, relative to some of the headwinds that the company has been facing and what they've delivered, especially on margins and with some of their goalposts that they had by end of year, I think there is an upside potential in margins for the company. Broadly, the visibility of some recovery over the next few quarters and, therefore, growth rates improving for most of these companies would be a factor that is important. But what we prefer is HCL Tech and TCS within the bigger ones.  Also Read: Can’t take equity capital flows for granted even if Fed cuts rates: Neelkanth Mishra  So what is the pecking order looking like now? Would you prefer Infosys over TCS given the fact that the stock has also underperformed vis-a-vis its peers?  While Infosys has historically maintained a discount of about 15-16 percent compared to TCS, which remains consistent, I believe TCS is poised to continue its outperformance. The period during which Infosys outpaced TCS was characterised by substantial growth. However, looking ahead, I don't foresee Infosys replicating that trend in the next couple of years due to specific company challenges. There is an increased reliance on the pass-through element in some of their significant deals, which is not an ideal starting point given the current circumstances. Although there is an anticipated recovery for Infosys, with FY25 expected to fare better than FY24, I still lean towards TCS as my preferred choice. The attrition rate has come down, so on the supply side things have improved, but if you look at the headcount, we saw a second straight quarter of decline for both Infosys and TCS. Do you think the trend will continue at least for the next few quarters?  Yes, there should be a recovery on the hiring front in the next quarter or two. There is still considerable capacity in the form of a bench that provides companies like Infosys the opportunity to enhance their utilisation. The hiring strategies that preceded this period enabled them to maintain relatively lower gross hire levels and adopt just-in-time hiring methodologies, even on the campus side post-COVID. This approach allows companies to align their hiring more closely with demand rather than building a surplus, as was done previously. So, I think some of these optimisations would continue.  Also Read: HCL Tech up 4%, extend gains as brokerages raise EPS estimates on Q3 beat  Subcontracting is another form of delivery that companies have optimised and there is still enough room for reduction in that aspect. So the operational levers are looking quite favourable for the company. Notably, attrition rates are currently lower than the historical average for companies, and the cost of replacement is no longer a significant challenge. I think those factors should start to help, especially as even onshore wage inflation seems to be coming down. That is a bigger cost element. So normalisation of these factors would be another thing that would work in their favour. So margins look quite fair.  Anything catching your fancy from the mid-cap IT pack? Given the fact that mid-cap IT has performed better than large-caps, do you think valuations are stretched here?  Persistent Systems stands out within the midcap IT sector, presenting an attractive opportunity. I anticipate the company will maintain its trend of outperforming its peers, with the potential for margin improvement. Therefore, Persistent Systems is expected to outshine its counterparts. Within the smaller names, Birla Soft witnessed a turnaround in the last quarter, and this positive trajectory is likely to persist.

As long as it is above 21,580, buying on dips can be a prudent strategy.","By Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors  On the daily charts, Nifty has broken above the trading range of the past eight sessions, where it was consolidating between 21,440–21,800. The IT sector helped Nifty reach record highs as heavyweights TCS and Infosys gained sharply on Friday, January 12, 2024. Reliance Industries also supported the rally as it has been trading near record highs for the past three trading sessions. Further, we can see healthy sector rotation, where different sectors are contributing to the upmove.  Going by the Elliott wave, prices are currently in wave iii of (v). Hence, it is best to use dips as buying opportunities, unless there is any close below the support level of 21,580 (what to do then, not buy?). A close above the immediate psychological hurdle of 22,000 will further extend the short-term upmove.  In short, the Nifty has just broken out from the flag pattern, and may further accelerate towards 22,118 levels. As long as it is above 21,580, buying on dips can be a prudent strategy.  Nifty Hourly chart:    On the weekly charts, Nifty IT, in the week starting December 11, 2023, broke through the resistance of 34,000 and has managed to hold and close above that level for the past four weeks. On Friday, the index formed a bullish candle and closed above three weeks of consolidation. It  is approaching the key resistance level of 36,800. A breach above this can trigger fresh buying in the IT sector and take Nifty IT to a lifetime high of about 40,000. The momentum is strong, so there is a high possibility that the upward journey will continue.  In short, the IT sector looks bullish.  NIFTY IT weekly chart    What to Pick in IT Sector  Tata Consultancy Services  On Friday, TCS had a 3 percent  gap-up opening and closed at the highest point on the weekly chart. TCS has formed a strong bullish candle after three weeks of consolidation. Further upside may be seen above Rs 3,930, with prices reaching an all-time high of around Rs 4,045.  On the daily charts, the stock is near an important resistance zone — Rs 3,905 to 3,930 — and any closing above the latter will indicate fresh buying in TCS. The stochastic RSI (relative strength index) has formed a bullish crossover, suggesting a bullish bias.  Thus, the larger bullish trend is intact.  Info Edge India  Naukri has formed an inverted head and shoulder pattern on the daily charts and it is on the edge of a breakout from the same. A close above Rs 5,387 is needed to confirm the breakout, after which, a good rise is expected in this stock.  Along with this, volumes are also picking up, which is acting as a confirmation of the bullish stance. After a breakout, we can expect a rise towards Rs 5,760 levels, whereas Rs 5,000 is the nearest support level.

TCS,2024-01-12T14:23:10+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Why TCS and Infosys’ Gen AI commentaries in Q3 felt lacklustre,"Both the companies shied away from sharing definitive numbers around deal pipeline opportunities or outlook on generating revenue from Gen AI. Meanwhile, Accenture is talking about industry leading growth in the technology.","India’s two biggest IT services companies Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys reported their third-quarter earnings for FY24 on January 11. Amidst a seasonally weak quarter and an uncertain demand environment, all eyes were on their generative AI updates, especially with rival Accenture betting big on the opportunity in 2024.  Though both TCS and Infosys spoke about training and skilling 150,000 and 100,000 employees, respectively, in generative AI and AI skills as well as the continued experimentation with the technology by clients; they shied away from sharing definitive numbers or updates on deal pipeline opportunities or prospects of revenue in coming quarters.  This comes at a time when global rival Accenture is betting big on the technology. Despite ongoing uncertainties around the revival of discretionary spending by clients, Accenture expects Gen AI growth to accelerate manifolds in 2024.  During its Q1 FY24 earnings announcement in December, Accenture revealed an industry-leading Gen AI deal pipeline of $450 million in new bookings in a single quarter.  The company said that it expects clients to move from Gen AI experimentation to more proof of concepts and pilots in 2024. Moreover, Accenture is also looking to double down on skilling its data and AI workforce to 80,000 from 40,000 at the beginning of the year.  Earlier in 2023, the company said it would invest $3 billion over the next three years into its data and AI practice.  Meanwhile, TCS said their clients have started getting comfortable with the technology and figuring out how they can drive the most benefit out of it. In Q2, TCS had mentioned that it had 250 generative AI opportunities in the pipeline, but no update was shared on that during the Q3 earnings conference.  K Krithivasan, CEO and MD, TCS, however, said, “The way we see it is the clients are trying to see what benefit they can gain and are doing multiple experimentations like I talked about. Some of the PoCs have moved to production, but they're all small projects.”  TCS COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam said that clients want to try out new things in new areas across technology operations.  “We are continuing with our focus on training majority of our workforce on using Gen AI and coming up with innovative ideas, to improve productivity and efficiency as well as deliver projects and architecture which can evolve on its own. The possibilities that we see for the future is enormous,” He added.  Infosys, during the company’s annual general meeting in June 2023, had mentioned that it had 50 active client projects that are leveraging its Gen AI capabilities.  As for the company’s Q3 earnings on January 11, CEO and MD Salil Parekh said that Infosys is seeing “strong traction” for generative AI programmes leveraging its Topaz offering capabilities and these capabilities have been integrated into its service line portfolio.  “Generative AI is going extremely strong. There’s a lot of activity with clients. For example, we are working on large diverse structural issues. This is a very strategic time where we are working with a large global bank over use large language models to make that risk area better. We have a large number of such deals,” Parekh said.  He added, “We are not at this stage of publicly sharing what the Gen AI revenue. The reaction is endless capability, a good leading market position. In generative AI, we are very strong in the capabilities.”  Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of management consulting firm Everest Group, earlier this month, told Moneycontrol that he believes most of the PoCs undertaken in 2023 will not move into production in 2024.  “This may be as high as 90 percent of the PoCs,” he had said.  “However, the 10 percent which do move (to production) will indicate to the market where Gen AI does work and we expect significant opportunities to arise in these areas for the tech services firms by the third quarter of 2024,” he added.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/why-tcs-and-infosys-gen-ai-commentary-in-q3-felt-lacklustre-12041361.html

TCS,2024-01-09T14:07:34+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS Q3 Earnings Preview: 5 things to watch out for,TCS will be announcing its third quarter earnings for FY24 today. This quarter was largely a slow quarter for not just TCS but the IT sector overall,"The country’s largest IT services company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), is set to announce its earnings on January 11, for the third quarter ended December 31 of the financial year 2024.  This quarter was largely a slow quarter for not just TCS but the IT sector overall amidst the holiday season in key markets like the North America and Europe, coupled with uncertainty in discretionary spending and restrained technology budgets of clients, also resulting in higher furloughs.  As the sector gears up for the next calendar year after seeing one of the weakest years in terms of growth in 2023, it will also have to brace for the upcoming elections in the US and India and what it holds for the clients’ industries.  Analysts expect muted quarterly earnings, with three out of the top 5 tier-I IT companies estimated to report a decline in QoQ and YoY revenue growth, though TCS would likely remain steady. TCS is expected to see a flattish EBIT margin uptick by 20 basis points in Q3, according to Moneycontrol’s poll estimates.  Here are the five themes to watch out for in TCS’ Q3 performance:  Revenue growth  According to Moneycontrol’s estimates, TCS’s revenue for the quarter is expected to grow 2.46 percent YoY and on a sequential basis, it is expected to decline by 0.05 percent, coming in at Rs 59.662 crores.  Net profit is estimated to reach Rs 11,504 crores, growing by around 6.06 percent YoY and 1.43 percent QoQ.  “We expect muted overall revenue growth due to furloughs in hi-tech and financial services…We expect moderate deal wins of $8.5-9 billion. Quantum of deals announced has been muted especially in the North American market. The focus will be on the outcome of the client budgeting cycle for CY2024,” said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities.  Commentary on expectations of spending revival, especially discretionary spending, improving margins and client budgeting will be closely observed.    Demand outlook  The second quarter was historically the strongest in terms of deal total contract value (TCV) for the top five IT companies. TCS reported a TCV of $11.2 billion in Q2 – its second largest in a quarter – and the third consecutive quarter of over $10 billion in TCV.  This was driven by some mega deals of $700 million plus in value and several multi-year deal renewals. In turn, TCS had increased its quarterly deal win guidance to $9-10 billion, up from $7-9 billion.  In Q3, however, mega deal wins have been slower to come by leaving analysts expecting TCV to be in the lower end of the guided range.  Geographically, North America, a key market for TCS remained a weak spot in terms of deal wins. According to data from Kotak, only three out of the 29 key deals announced for the IT sector, were from North America while the majority came from the Europe region.

Last quarter, TCS said that it plans to hire 40,000 freshers in FY24.  Apart from a slowdown in fresher intake, TCS is also onboarding lateral hires in a phased manner. All of this could culminate in further decline or at least slowing of headcount addition as furloughs will also be high in Q3.  Poaching crisis and retirement year  A talking point lately in the Indian IT industry is that company veterans are moving out to join other leadership positions in rival companies. Last week, Wipro was in the news for suing two of its former senior executives including ex-chief financial officer Jatin Dalal for joining Cognizant by breaching non-compete clause in his employment contract.  Infosys too had to send out written communication to deter Cognizant from poaching talent from the firm.  Though TCS was one of the fortunate ones among the top IT companies that didn’t see as many such instances, any industry-focussed comments on the same will be observed.  Moreover, TCS would instead have some senior leadership members retiring in 2024. According to media reports, TCS veteran and chief operating officer (COO) as TCS veteran N Ganapathy Subramaniam is set to retire in May 2024, while Ritu Anand, chief leadership and diversity officer is likely to retire in March.  Generative AI commentary  Cloud adoption and artificial intelligence are the two major themes that TCS’ management is currently building its future demand thesis on. This was evident from the restructuring unveiled in 2023. The company had set up a new unit called TCS AI Cloud, combining all its public cloud units and Al initiatives.  During the Q2 earnings conference in October, TCS said that it has more than 250 generative AI opportunities in the pipeline and completed training over 100,000 employees.  As of now, rival Accenture seems to be ahead of the curve in terms of generative AI projects, though the company’s overall demand outlook too remained bleak. Accenture reported that its generative AI pipeline rose to $450 million worth of new bookings in its first quarter ended December 30, compared to $300 million in the full year of FY23. The company expects clients to move from Gen AI experimentation to more proof of concepts and pilots in 2024.  TCS’ plans and updates on generative AI adoption will be closely watched.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/tcs-q3-earnings-5-things-to-watch-out-for-12022371.html

TCS,2023-11-15T17:36:31+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"After five-day work from office, now TCS sends sudden transfer notices",IT employee union NITES has filed a formal complaint with the Ministry of Labour and Employment against TCS alleging unethical transfer practices based on 180-plus complaints received.,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has sent out transfer notices to over 2,000 employees across locations, asking them to join the assigned location within 15 days, according to IT employee union Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). This comes a month after TCS made it mandatory for employees to work from office five days a week.  According to a few emails seen by Moneycontrol, employees were given a notice of around two weeks to move to the assigned locations. Based on the company policies applicable, employees will be able to reimburse travel and accommodation costs. Employees started receiving these emails from the end of August.  Failing to adhere to this will lead to the employees facing “initiation of disciplinary actions.”  At least 180 outraged employees have sent complaints to NITES, alleging TCS of forcing them to shift “without proper notice or consultation, causing immense hardship for them and their families.” The IT union has now filed a formal complaint with the Ministry of Labour and Employment against TCS for unethical transfer practices.  Harpreet Singh Saluja, President, NITES said, “The company is ignoring all the financial hardship, family disruption, stress and anxiety that these forced transfers cause to employees… TCS is putting its employees through unnecessary hardship and is violating their rights. We have urged the Ministry of Labour and Employment to investigate TCS's actions and take appropriate measures to protect IT workers from such unethical practices.”  A TCS executive seeking anonymity told Moneycontrol that this is a routine movement done on a case-to-case basis, as the company tends to ask required employees to move to certain locations depending on the projects assigned.  “This is especially applicable for the freshers who may have been trained at different locations, but are now getting deployed on actual projects,” the executive added.  The company, however, declined to comment on Moneycontrol’s emailed queries.  Saluja told Moneycontrol that while some employees have agreed and already moved to the locations assigned, around 150-200 employees were still hesitant and in conversation with HR officers of the company regarding their concerns. But once their two-week timeline ended, without any further notices their email access was revoked for not shifting.  “These employees were not able to communicate with the HRs over email anymore. HRs then asked them to report to the assigned locations immediately, else they would stand to lose their salaries and jobs,” he said.  Saluja added, &quot;In fact, the employees who shifted to Mumbai location on 'urgent business' nearly a month ago, are still on bench. They haven't been assigned work yet.&quot;  Five days of work from office  This comes over a month after TCS sent out emails asking certain teams to work from office at least five days a week, starting from October 1, 2023.  While the hybrid work transition mandate expecting three days work from office will still be the norm, Moneycontrol’s sources have shared that managers in various divisions have been nudging employees to come in to office five times a week.

A few internal names that came up include ES Chakravarthy, the global head of RMG who was sent on leave. Arun GK, who had headed one of the functions in the team, was one of the four other employees sacked.  On the same day, TCS clarified through exchange filings that recruitment activities in TCS were not directly handled by the RMG. Instead, RMG was only responsible for allocating available resources on various projects in case of talent shortfall, and it would fill in such positions through contractors.  Here’s a primer on all you need to know about this case:  What TCS chairman N Chandrasekaran has said  On June 29, during the company’s annual general meeting, TCS chairman N Chandrasekaran detailed how the issue unfolded for the senior management at the company.  At that time, the investigation was still on and Chandrasekaran had said that around six employees were then found to be not following ethical conduct. He added that the company couldn’t “quantify what favours they got but they certainly behaved in a way that they were favouring certain firms.”  TCS had also started examining its entire business associates (BA) supply management process to determine weaknesses and clean up the hiring process.  What transpired behind the scenes and TCS’ findings?  According to Chandrasekaran, the senior management was first alerted about the wrongdoings by two whistleblowers in February and March 2023.  “The complaints were about certain favouritism done and favours received in the recruitment of business associates,” he had said.  The whistleblowers informed the company’s CEO K Krithivasan and COO Natarajan Ganapathy Subramaniam. TCS immediately started running an internal investigation into these charges.  Based on the initial findings, TCS had earlier said that the issue relates to &quot;breach of Company’s Code of Conduct by certain employees and vendors providing contractors; and no key managerial person of the Company has been found to be involved.&quot;  The company ultimately found two similar cases, one in India and the other in the US. The India cased was investigated by a senior executive within the company while the US one was conducted by an external official.  How does TCS work with staffing firms?  TCS uses two departments to acquire and deploy talent. The HR and talent acquisition team is the main department hiring employees and then there is a resource allocation group that deploys available resources on projects or sources talent from staffing firms. In the case of talent shortage or a particular skill requirement at a given location, the company would use a set of staffing firms to get contract employees.  But Chandrasekaran explained that at any given point, employees hired on a contractual basis from such staffing firms would account for only 2-3 percent of the overall deployment of resources.  There’s in fact a large pool of staffing firms which TCS works with. These firms had to go through a rigorous process and checks to qualify to work with TCS.  “There are about a little over 1,000 such firms globally because we need resources in 55 such countries. And each one of them does a certain amount of business depending on their skill availability,” Chandrasekaran said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mc-explains-what-is-tcs-bribe-for-job-probe-all-about-11540701.html

The investigation closure report comes months after the company looked into practices where staffing firms were allegedly involved in bribing senior executives overseeing recruitment processes in the company to get business.  It took action against 19 employees in total -- 16 of whom were sacked and three removed from the function.  &quot;Our investigation found 19 employees to be involved and action has been taken against all as detailed here - 16 employees have been separated from the Company for code of conduct violations, and 3 employees have been removed from the Resource Management function,&quot; TCS said in an exchange filing.  It added that six vendor entities, their owners and affiliates have been debarred from doing any business with the company.  The company further said it would continue to enhance its governance measures by regular rotation of personnel performing key roles in the Resource Management function, enhanced analytics on supplier management, periodic declarations by vendors on compliance to the Tata Code of Conduct and know-your-supplier process to cover additional declarations, and vendor management process audits.  The company maintained that it does not involve fraud against the company and there is no financial impact, and that no key managerial person was involved.  In the press conference held after the company announced its second quarter results, Chief Executive Officer K Krithivasan said that the firm had take &quot;appropriate action&quot;.  “We have completed our investigation. We have taken appropriate action against whosoever we believe violated our code of conduct. Actions differ based on the kind of violation but all actions have been taken and it's closed,” the CEO said.  When asked about what steps the company was taking to ensure this doesn't happen again during the company's Q2 earnings conference on October 11, Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said the company was looking into organisational, people, process and technological aspects but did not comment on specifics.  Tata Sons N Chandrasekaran had told shareholders at the annual general meeting that he could not quantify what favours they got, but the employees in question &quot;certainly behaved in a way that they were favouring certain firms.&quot;  How it unfolded?  The case first came into light on June 23, 2023, when TCS in its stock exchange filings, following a whistleblower complaint, said that the RMG (Resource Management Group) didn’t handle any recruitment activities for TCS and that it was only responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects and incase of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors.  Later during the company’s AGM on June 29, TCS’ chairman N Chandrasekaran had said that the company had already started investigating, sacking six employees and staffing firms.  How TCS works with staffing firms?  Chandrasekaran had detailed that TCS uses two departments for acquiring talent: the HR and talent acquisition, which hires people and the resource allocation group which deploys available resources into projects. In the case of talent shortage or a need for a particular skill that is not available in a location, the company has a set of BA firms (business associate firms or staffing firms) to get contract employees.  “At any point in time in the overall deployment of resources, about 2-3 percent of them are such BAs or contractors. The complaint was related to certain individuals in the company working with certain BA firms to be recruiting in their favour,” Chandrasekaran explained.  He added, “There are a large number of BA firms that TCS works with. There is a rigorous process in the company to recruit or qualify a firm to be called a BA firm. There are about a little over 1,000 such firms globally because we need resources in 55 such countries. And each one of them does a certain amount of business depending on their skill availability.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-bribe-for-jobs-probe-outcome-16-employees-fired-6-vendor-entities-debarred-11536551.html

Speaking at TCS’ Q2 earnings conference on October 11, CEO and MD K Krithivasan said generative AI had caught everyone’s attention. &quot;At our customer summit, everyone was talking generative AI as a key theme and how they are trying to leverage it for new product and services.

Most brokerage firms now await to see the strong deal wins translate into revenue growth, however a few expect it to be pushed on to FY25, dragged by the weak macro environment.  &quot;The second half of FY24 is unlikely to see a V-shaped recovery for TCS as bulk of the benefit of ramp-up of large deals will only be visible in FY25,&quot; brokerage firm HSBC stated in its report.

While Communication (+2.3% QoQcc) and Regional Markets (+3.8% QoQcc) drove growth, tech (-1.6% QoQcc), Lifesciences (-0.9% QoQcc) and Manufacturing vertical (-0.7% QoQcc) impacted growth. Revenue decline in North America (-0.7 percent QoQcc) for a third straight quarter also impacted growth, according to them.

TCS,2023-10-11T21:15:12+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,Why TCS told employees to return to office 5 days a week,"While the company previously announced a 25x25 model of working by 2025, it did not commit to anything and will assess future work models as they go forward. ","India’s largest private sector employer Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was the first among the large IT sector players to mandate at least some of its employees to return to work on all days of the week. According to the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad, TCS “strongly believes” that people need to come back to the office.  This marked a shift in work-from-home policies for the IT sector, signalling a return to pre-pandemic style of work.  The reason for this, according to the CHRO, is that a large number of people who have joined the company in the last three years have either worked virtually or in a hybrid manner.  “We strongly believe that they need to come to work so that the new workforce gets integrated with the larger workforce of TCS. That is the only way they will learn, understand, and internalize TCS values and the TCS way,” Lakkad said.  Employees were asked to return to work 5 days a week starting October, and Moneycontrol previously reported that emails were sent out to various units.  This is also a change in policy for the company, which, since September 2022, had asked employees to come into the office three days a week and mandated that they adhere to a roster. Lakkad has also previously said that while working from home was more convenient for everybody, there were drawbacks to the system.  Chief Operating Officer NG Subramaniam said on October 11 that the company has been advising its employees to work from the office, and are realising its advantages.  “People feel that it is better to be in the office.  About 70 percent of our employees have started to come to office at this stage which is a very good thing. Given the large-scale hiring that we did and the kind of attrition that we experienced…we believe that it is advisable to get everybody back to the office at this stage, which is the need of the hour for TCS,” NGS said.  “The TCS way of working, the membership that they experience and the kind of interactions that one typically has in a collective with customers, these things are not taught anywhere. These things are observed and learned and it's better in a collective workplace,” he added.  This is at odds with the company’s previously announced 25x25 plan. In 2020, under former chief executive officer Rajesh Gopinathan, the company had announced its plan where, by 2025, only 25 percent of its associates will need to work out of its facilities at any point of time. Also, it believes employees will not need to spend more than 25 percent of their time at work.  In response, the COO said that it can be said that for now, this plan is defocused and it’s not necessary that the company will adhere to this plan.  “The important thing is do we have the right systems processes and procedures to adapt ourselves to the needs of things? Our focus is to get everybody back to office, and for that the people who have joined us in the last two years or three years get the full feel of TCS. I think that's more important,” he said.  According to CHRO Lakkad, the company will assess its future work models as they go forward but did not commit to anything. “We will adopt based on what works for our employees and our customers,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/why-tcs-told-employees-to-return-to-office-5-days-a-week-11517201.html

The IT services major also increased its quarterly order book guidance to $9-10 billion.,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported a strong order book of $11.2 billion for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The IT services major won some of the largest deals in the sector this quarter, beating macroeconomic challenges and surpassing its own quarterly deal win guidance of $7-9 billion.  This is the third consecutive quarter that TCS reported over $10 billion in order book. TCS also updated and increased its quarterly order book guidance to $9-10 billion.  The total contract value (TCV) for Q2 was up by 38.27 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis as compared to $8.1 billion reported in Q2FY23. Last quarter, TCV stood at $10.2 billion.  The growth was driven by the UK market which grew at about 10.7 percent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms. Among major markets, North America grew 0.1 percent and Continental Europe grew 1.3 percent. In emerging markets, Middle East &amp;amp; Africa grew 15.9 percent, India grew 3.9 percent, Latin America grew 13.1 percent, and Asia Pacific grew 4.1 percent.  Key segments like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) saw a slowdown in YoY growth in constant currency terms, declining 0.5  percent YoY, Communications &amp;amp; Media declined 2.1 percent, Technology &amp;amp; Services declined 2.2 percent, manufacturing grew 5.8 percent QoQ, Life Sciences and Healthcare which grew 5 percent and – showing signs of continued pressure in these segments especially BFSI and communication.  TCS also saw several multi-year deal renewals and extensions happening this quarter, including a deal with the BBC, Georgia’s Unemployment insurance system, GE HealthCare Technologies and a $1 billion five-year deal from Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), to name a few.  The company is also seeing strong demand coming from generative AI offerings, reporting a pipeline of over 250 generative AI opportunities. TCS has also completed training for over 100,000 employees in generative AI capabilities.  K Krithivasan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, said: “Our clients continue to entrust us with critical new technology initiatives, and large programs to digitally transform their IT and business operating models. Strong deal momentum delivered us a very large order book in Q2 – our second highest TCV ever in a quarter, and a good pipeline.”  “The resilience of demand for our services, our clients’ willingness to commit to long tenure programs and their continued appetite for experimentation with Gen AI and other new technologies give us confidence in our longer-term growth prospects.”  TCS gets over $1 billion from BSNL deal  TCS confirmed that it will be clocking in over $1 billion in total contract value from the BSNL 4G roll out deal, which it bagged in a consortium with other companies including telecom gear maker Tejas Networks.

The project involves supply, planning, design, installation and commissioning, and optimization of this mobile network, satisfying a detailed set of requirements conforming to 3GPP standards.  &quot;TCS and its partners have integrated the EPC Core, RAN and NMS and have started the roll-out of the network which is expected to be completed in stages over the next 18 months,&quot; the company said in the release.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-q2-order-book-grows-to-11-2-billion-up-38-2-yoy-11516661.html
TCS,2023-10-10T13:11:25+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS Q2 earnings: 5 things to watch out for,"Q2 earnings preview: TCS is expected to report a muted quarter, with PAT estimated to be up by 0.8 percent QoQ at Rs 11,162 crore","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is set to kick-start the IT sector earnings season for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 on October 11.  This was a crucial quarter for the IT services bellwether, given the internal restructuring of its verticals and new vertical head appointments -– the first major leadership rejig under new CEO K Krithivasan.  While there were strong deal wins, especially among the top three IT companies --- TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech -- analysts expect the quarter that ended in September 30, 2023, to remain muted amidst the uncertainty in demand and continued caution on discretionary spending.  Analysts expect EBIT margins for most IT companies, including TCS, to improve this quarter as its wage hike cycle impact was taken in Q1. TCS is likely to see an improvement of 50-60 bps, touching an estimated 23.6 percent, according to CNBC-TV18’s poll.  Here are the five themes to watch out for in TCS’ Q2 performance:  Revenue growth  According to CNBC-TV18’s estimate poll, rupee revenue growth on a QoQ basis is expected to come in at 1.3 percent at Rs 60,160 crore, compared to Rs 59,381 crore in Q1.  Profit after tax (PAT) is estimated to be up by 0.8 percent QoQ at Rs 11,162 crore. Like the previous couple of quarters, this quarter, too, will remain subdued. All eyes will be on the management commentary on whether the worst is behind.  “We forecast marginal revenue growth due to persisting weakness in discretionary spends across several verticals,” said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities.  Demand outlook  TCS reported some of the largest new deals in 2023 as well as multi-year renewals with existing clients. Some of the major deals from the last quarter include the $1 billion deal from Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and a $1.1 billion deal from the UK’s workplace pension scheme NEST. Driven by these numbers, analysts estimate TCS’ order book for Q2 to come in the range of $11-13 billion, up from the company’s guidance of $7-9 billion.  According to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, the management’s commentary on the revival of discretionary spending, outlook on macroeconomic challenges, cost takeout and vendor consolidation deal pipeline, geographic trends, especially in North America, and the impact of GCC ramp-ups will be looked into.  Sectoral trends  According to analysts at ICICI Securities, TCS gets nearly 53 percent of its overall revenue from sectors like BFSI, retail and telecom, which “continue to see macro pressures and have consequently slashed their discretionary spends while putting older projects under greater scrutiny.”  While deal flows have steadied, analysts believe growth will not be very democratic and will depend on a mix of verticals, services and the company’s ability to win large deals amidst exposure to affected customers.  A lot of the deals this quarter have also seen customers increasingly looking for embedded artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI elements into it. Hence, IT companies, too, are aggressively betting on these features to win deals. For instance, TCS started a unit called TCS AI Cloud, combining all its public cloud units and Al initiatives.  Return to offices  Last month, TCS sparked off an industry-wide debate after it decided to end work from home, making it compulsory for certain teams to be in offices for five days a week. The IT sector major employs over 600,000 people, signalling an end to the work-from-home era for the IT industry in India.  This could lead to an increase in overhead costs on the campuses, and a fear of near-term increase in attrition as angry employees may consider resigning. The management’s views on this and how it is assessing the situation will be important.  Earlier, under former CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, TCS had announced its 25X25 vision. As per the model, by 2025, only 25 percent of its associates will need to work out of facilities at any point of time. Also, employees will not need to spend more than 25 percent of their time at work.  Hiring slowdown   A direct reflection of slowing demand in the sector was the significant reduction in quarterly net headcount addition. In Q1, TCS was the only company to have a positive net addition of 523 people. Four out of the five IT majors in India, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and LTIMindtree, reported a fall in headcount in Q1FY24, with the total numbers plunging by over 20,000 as compared to the same quarter last fiscal year.  TCS was also the only IT company to share its fresher hiring target of 40,000 for FY24. Any change or update in these plans will be closely monitored. TCS, however, had delayed onboarding of lateral hires by three months due to project commencement delays.

TCS,2023-10-09T09:29:08+05:30,Moneycontrol News,TCS hits 52-week high on plans to consider share buyback on Oct 11,Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley feels the share buyback plan was already anticipated by the market for the last two quarters and hence doesn't assure outperformance for the stock.,"Shares of Tata Consultancy Services opened one percent higher and hit a 52-week high of Rs 3,659 on October 9 after the company announced plans to consider a share buyback, along with its July-September results on October 11. However, the stock soon fell off its highs to trade marginally higher.  The stock reaction aligned with the views from foreign brokerage Morgan Stanley which believes the buyback was unlikely to trigger an outperformance of the stock.  Morgan Stanley also feels that the announcement of the buyback plans does not necessarily provide enough assurance to stakeholders as it was already anticipated by the market for the last two quarters.  The buyback announcement from TCS comes after two other information technology companies, Infosys and Wipro completed their share buybacks earlier this year. Infosys rolled out its buyback after purchasing 6.04 crore shares for Rs 9,300 crore in February, while Wipro announced its largest-ever share buyback worth Rs 12,000 crore in June.  Moreover, in a scenario where quarterly earnings for information technology companies have been under pressure due to a slow offtake in order wins, the Street is more likely to remain focused on the July-September financial performance of TCS.  At 09.23 am, shares of TCS were trading 0.3 percent higher at Rs 3,633.60 on the National Stock Exchange.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  The foreign brokerage also expects TCS to show a slight improvement in its revenue growth on a sequential basis in the September quarter as order intake for the IT major is likely to remain robust.  Analysts at B&amp;amp;K Securities anticipate a 1 percent sequential earnings growth for TCS in the second quarter while those at Jefferies expect a 20-40 basis points margin expansion.  Despite expectations of a robust orderbook, Morgan Stanley's earnings estimates for TCS are lower than the consensus for FY24-25. The firm also attributes pressure on margins and a pricey stock valuation as major headwinds for the IT company.  &quot;Premium to its own average for the last five years is making the risk-reward unfavourable for TCS,&quot; the brokerage stated in its report. Morgan Stanley also holds an 'equalweight' rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 3,730, which reflects a mere 3 percent upside potential from Friday's close.

TCS,2023-10-05T13:22:15+05:30,Moneycontrol News,TCS bags deal to transform Georgia’s unemployment insurance system,The company didn’t disclose the tenure or the size of the deal under which TCS will replace the American state's 1980s-era legacy platform with cloud-based unemployment insurance system,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been selected by the labour department of the American state of Georgia to transform its 1980s-era legacy platform with cloud-based unemployment insurance system, India’s biggest IT services player said on October 5.  The company didn’t disclose the tenure and size of the deal, which, it said, would ensure eligible individuals receive prompt financial assistance and the claims process is streamlined.  “Digitised processes with automated workflows will enable faster processing of claims with reduced errors,” the company said. Advanced security features embedded in the new platform would help prevent fraud, save taxpayer dollars and ensure that benefits reach those in genuine need.  TCS bagged the deal on its track record of having helped several American states manage the exponential increase in unemployment claims during the coronavirus pandemic, including the integration of the Federal Government’s Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.  So far, the Indian company has transformed legacy unemployment insurance systems of Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New York and Wyoming.  In its partnership with Georgia, TCS will build a human-centric design of the new web-based platform making it convenient for Georgians to apply for unemployment insurance benefits, securely upload documents, check the status of their claims, and receive important updates.  There was an unprecedented surge in unemployment claims in Georgia during the pandemic – the third highest in the nation – straining the state's aging 40-year-old unemployment system and underscoring the urgent need for change.  Bruce Thompson, Commissioner, Georgia Department of Labor said a modern and responsive unemployment system minimizes claims processing times, enhances the customer experience, prevents fraud, and positions GDOL to become the most transparent and responsive agency in state government.  “In state after state, TCS has demonstrated how to leverage cutting-edge technology to improve accessibility, resilience, scalability, and transparency, significantly strengthening the critical safety net that unemployment insurance represents,” Robert Kane, Chief Commercial Officer, US Public Services, TCS added.  At 1.18 pm, TCS was trading at Rs 3,576.40 on the National  Stock Exchange, up 1.09 percent from the previous close.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-bags-deal-to-transform-georgias-unemployment-insurance-system-11482311.html

The overall market trend remains bearish, with the Nifty trading below critical moving averages.  Looking ahead, the market may continue to follow a bearish trend as long as it remains below 19,500, with initial support likely around 19,330, a fall below the said level might take the Nifty towards 19,250-19,200.  The bears in the Bank Nifty maintained their control, causing the index to break below the support at 44,200. The next immediate support level is positioned at 43,800, and a breach below this level could trigger aggressive selling pressure, potentially leading to a further 2 percent correction in the index.  On the upside, the immediate resistance is in the range of 44,250 to 44,300. A breakout above this range may incite some short-covering moves in the index.  Here are three buy calls for short term:  Suzlon Energy: Buy | LTP: Rs 28.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 27 | Target: Rs 30-32 | Return: 14 percent  Suzlon has experienced upward momentum over the past two days after breaking out of a consolidation phase. Additionally, the stock has remained above a crucial moving average.  The relative strength index (RSI) is currently showing a bullish crossover and is on the rise. The support is established at Rs 27 on the lower end, while resistance is observed in the range of Rs 30 to Rs 32 on the higher end.    Tata Consultancy Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,538 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,430 | Target: Rs 3,800 | Return: 7 percent  TCS exhibited a bullish sentiment as it formed a Bullish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily chart, signaling a bullish reversal. Furthermore, the stock managed to close above its 20-day moving average (20DMA), confirming its bullish undertone.  The momentum indicator RSI is poised for a positive crossover, further affirming the presence of strong momentum. The support for TCS is currently at Rs 3,430, with potential upside levels at Rs 3,640 and Rs 3,800.  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,529.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,485 | Target: Rs 1,650 | Return: 8 percent  HDFC Bank has shown a strong upward movement, rebounding from the day's low. Multiple swing highs and lows can be observed around Rs 1,515, suggesting that this level is likely to provide support for the stock price.  Additionally, a positive divergence is evident on the daily chart. In the short term, it is anticipated that the stock will advance towards Rs 1,650.

TCS asks employees to work from office 5 days a week from October 1,"No WFH for TCS: This is a marked shift from the company’s previous stance, which, since September 2022, has required employees to adhere to a roster and be in office three days a week. ","IT services major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is likely to end hybrid work from October 1, 2023. In an internal email, the company asked its workforce to attend office for five days a week, signalling a ongoing shift in work-from-home policies for the IT sector which employs over five million Indians.  To be sure, this transition mandate still continues to remain three days a week, but according to Moneycontrol’s sources, managers in various divisions have been nudging employees to come in to office five times a week. The company will however retain flexibility/hybrid policies and make exceptions wherever necessary.  An internal email accessed by CNBC-TV18, however, said, &quot;As communicated by CEO and chief human resources officer (CHRO) in various townhalls, it is mandatory for all associates to attend office on all the working days (5 days per week if there are no holidays) starting 1 October 2023.&quot;  This is a marked shift from TCS' previous stance, which, since September 2022, has required employees to adhere to a roster and be in office three days a week. It had also warned employees of consequences if they did not adhere to this roster.  The email has not gone out to all teams, and is being staggered, according to sources.  TCS declined to comment on Moneycontrol's queries stating that the company is in the &quot;silent period at the moment.&quot;  The company has previously also received flak, after Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said in a Q&amp;amp;A in the company’s annual report that attrition of women was higher when compared to men in FY23.  “Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or lower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for some women, keeping them from returning to office even after everything normalised,” Lakkad said.  As of quarter ended June 30, TCS had around 615,318 employees. In the company's FY23 annual report, Lakkad said, over half the workforce today was hired after March 2020.  &quot;Work from home is definitely more convenient for everybody, but there were drawbacks. Tenured employees who are well networked within the organization can work effectively and even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up over the years. That isn’t the case with more junior employees,&quot; Lakkad said.  He added, &quot;New employees get acculturated through physical interactions with senior colleagues and leaders, by observing and following their behaviors and ways of thinking. Without those interactions, employee engagement as well as acculturation got badly impacted. All these factors led us to gradually bring back people to our offices during the year.&quot;  Gopinathan's 25 x 25 rule  This seems to contradict former TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan's 25 X 25 vision, which he announced in 2020. As per the model, by 2025, only 25 percent of its associates will need to work out of facilities at any point of time. Also, the employees will not need to spend more than 25 percent of their time at work.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/end-of-wfh-tcs-asks-employees-to-work-from-office-5-days-a-week-from-october-1-11453171.html

The report by TCS stated that digital and data-driven operations are top priority for a future-ready organisation. The report uncovered the top focus areas for large enterprises and essential enablers for futuristic business operations.  According to the study, respondents identified new business models, profitability and cashflow, and employee experience as the top three strategic focus areas for their organisations.  Key factor for 'pacesetters'  Companies are recognising the value of connected business operations to gain a competitive advantage, the report said, adding that 89 percent of respondents identify data-driven operations as the most important factor for their organisations to execute their top business priorities and drive profitability.  The other three top enablers for a future-ready organisation identified by the survey are harmonisation of technologies (88 percent), business outcome focus (86 percent), and integrated operations (83 percent).  The survey identified 'Pacesetters' as the organisations with higher-than-average growth and revenue performance in 2018-2022. Pacesetters showed more affinity towards many of the key enablers of future-ready operations compared to all other respondents, particularly leveraging ecosystem partnerships; simplifying and modernising their technology landscape; blending process, domain and technology; and harmonising multiple technologies.  &quot;The survey affirms our belief that to stay competitive enterprises should first look at making their operations future-ready. Embracing the four key enablers - a digital and data-driven foundation, technology harmonization, business outcome focus, and integrated operations can allow companies to derive superior business outcomes, be more agile, innovative, and achieve competitive advantage,&quot; said Ashok Pai, Global Head, Enterprise Cognitive Business Operations, TCS.  AI strategy  As interest in artificial intelligence intensifies, the survey also polled respondents on what factors led to successful AI deployments. 89% cited quality data and governance, while 87% cited clear business charter. Interestingly, 81% said that removal of action bias - eliminating fear of missing out (FOMO)- is moderately or significantly important for successful AI technology deployments.  Survey respondents  The TCS Future of Operations Survey, published by the TCS Thought Leadership Institute, polled over 300 C-suite executives in Australia, France, Germany, the UK and the US in February of 2023.

TCS,2023-08-22T17:37:34+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,TCS gets some relief after court in US trims discrimination lawsuit,"In December 2022, a former TCS employee filed a lawsuit accusing the company of having a systematic pattern of discriminating against non-South Asian and non-Indian applicants and employees","Eight months after a lawsuit was slapped on IT major Tata Consultancy Services- (TCS) for discrimination and violation of visa norms, a court in New Jersey has trimmed the lawsuit by tossing one of the three claims made by the complainant. The other two claims will move forward.  In December 2022, the country’s largest software exporter was accused of having a systematic pattern of discriminating against non-South Asian and non-Indian applicants and employees, by a former employee. Shawn Katz, the complainant, alleged that the discrimination was with respect to hiring, staffing, benching, termination and promotion decisions, and that this policy is implemented top-down at the company.  Katz worked for the company for nine years before being let go after he was on the bench and could not find other projects.  “TCS’s discrimination is systemic and ongoing, and impacts non-South Asians and non-Indians across the company, as well as applicants, who are disfavored in TCS’s hiring, staffing, promotion, and termination/retention decisions,” the complaint read. His complaint said that the company was looking to maximise its benching, hiring and termination policies to maximise visa holders or those on an H-1B work visa in the US, which is sponsored by the employer. He also alleged that TCS prioritised visa holders for TCS positions.  Katz had filed a class action lawsuit, referring to a group of people who have suffered the same or similar injury.  Also read: TCS faces lawsuit in the US alleging discriminatory hiring practices, violation of visa norms  Katz alleged that he was facing disparate treatment on the basis of race, and unlawful employment practices on the basis of race and national origin. He sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages. In response, TCS file a motion to dismiss, which Katz opposed.  As per the order by Justice Brian R Martinotti in the New Jersey District Court this month, TCS had said that one of Katz’s disparate impact claims, as well as claims for injunctive relief, should be dismissed. “Additionally, TCS asserts all of Katz’s claims should be dismissed to the extent they are based on an alleged failure to hire or place,” as per the order.  Disparate impact requires that an employer cannot use a facially neutral policy — one where the policy does not discriminate on its face — but nevertheless causes a significant discriminatory hiring pattern.  The court did not move forward with Katz’s disparate impact claim under Title VII (equality before law) because he was unable to establish a ‘prima facie’ case for it.  However, the court said the allegations sound like disparate treatment, rather than disparate impact. Disparate impact refers to discrimination that is unintentional, and disparate treatment refers to intentional discrimination.  “TCS’s benching, hiring, and termination policies to maximise visa-holders, who Katz alleges are “almost exclusively South Asian,” followed by TCS prioritizing those visa-holders for TCS positions, are not facially neutral policies because Katz …alleges TCS implements these policies to further a preference for South Asians and Indians,” the order states.  Katz had also asked for injunctive relief. TCS in its motion said that Katz is not seeking reinstatement or being harmed by any action of TCS, but Katz, in an amended complement, sought reinstatement and sought injunctive relief on behalf of the class. The judge allowed this motion to move forward.  For the third charge, the IT major’s motion to dismiss all claims based on discriminatory hiring or placement was denied.  In response to queries, TCS said, “As the matter is sub judice, we will not be able to comment.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-gets-some-relief-after-court-in-us-trims-discrimination-lawsuit-11238271.html
TCS,2023-08-09T17:36:18+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Indian IT firms may face modest impact from Moody’s downgrade of US banks,"According to analysts, tech spending has already bottomed out for the IT industry compared to its normal levels, any further worsening in the BFSI vertical will now only have a moderate effect","The panic surrounding banking contagion in the US affecting IT companies in the recent past may have subsided but a souring environment is adding to the latter’s woes.  On August 8, Moody’s lowered its ratings for 10 small and midsize lenders, and said it may downgrade six other major banks. This comes at a time when banks are continuing to focus on efficiency gains, and discretionary spending has been reduced significantly.  According to Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of global research firm Everest Group, this bad news for the US banks will only add to the headwinds that the IT sector has been facing amid significantly reduced discretionary spending in the sector. He added that Moody’s downgrade is indicative of the pressure that banks are under, smaller banks in particular. But it may not be all bad news.  “We believe that this souring environment will only modestly reduce the level of discretionary spend,” he told Moneycontrol.  This is because spends are already below industry norms, and Everest believes it's either at or close to the bottom. Additionally, smaller US banks have been impacted more, which do not contribute to the Indian IT sector significantly.  “The small banks which this most affects or is indicative of, do not contribute significantly to the marketplace for the large Indian tech services firms. On the bright side we believe that this will add more impetus to the banking consolidation that the US Federal Reserve is attempting to drive, and as this plays out the larger banks will reach out to the Indian tech services firms for post-merger integration which will provide attractive opportunities in the sector,” Bendor-Samuel said.  IT companies’ BFSI challenge  The softness in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical was a common theme across Indian IT companies in the recently concluded earnings season, despite some deal wins coming in from this vertical. While Wipro had said that BFSI was impacted due to softer discretionary spends, Infosys said clients were typically not choosing to spend at this time.  “Large and super regional banking clients in the US have been resilient during this quarter. Large banking clients are focusing on vendor consolidation, cost takeout and self-funding transformation programmes,” Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy told analysts. Infosys said it was seeing different patterns with different clients in the sector. Pressure was visible in asset management, investment banking, payments, and mortgages.  But IT companies have also maintained that the overall BFSI impact has been sporadic depending on the sub-segments like lending, insurance, capital markets, etc.  Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the country’s largest IT services firm, generates over 31 percent of its revenue from the BFSI vertical but has seen some moderation in growth in Q1FY24.  In a recent interview with Moneycontrol, K Krithivasan, CEO and MD of TCS, said, “When we say banking, financial services and insurance, large banks are a component of it. We have capital markets, we have insurance firms, we have mortgage firms – not every sector of the industry is doing well, right like we are doing quite well in banking. But all of them must fire for us to show you growth. If only one segment grows, you don't get that benefit.”  Also Read: Global banking crisis adds to woes of IT firms, slowdown expected in near term  Large US banks reducing tech spends  According to a note from ICICI Securities, some of the largest US banks have started to reduce technology spending on a quarter-on-quarter basis, with the exception of Citi Bank. Banks are also increasingly highlighting efficiency targets from tech spends.  For instance, JP Morgan mentioned on its investor day that it has delivered $0.5 billion in productivity-led savings versus its 3-year productivity target of $1.5 billion set in May 2022, the note said.  In terms of tech spend reduction, major US banks including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley lowered spending in Q2CY23 versus Q1CY23, “yet grew at a rate in line with, or better than, their respective revenue growth”, ICICI Securities said.  While Bank of America and JP Morgan have retained their full-year tech spending outlook, across banks there will be a higher focus on realising efficiency gains through past and ongoing technology investments. Commentary from banks has largely shown that there is a higher focus on realising efficiency gains through investments they have made previously as well as those that are ongoing.  However, according to ICICI Securities, mid-sized banks are continuing with their transformation programs, going by their commentary.  While it has slowed down on a QoQ basis, a note by Kotak Institutional Equities said that US regional banks have not yet announced any significant cuts to tech expenses or budgets, and some have even indicated a continuous pace of investment into technology. Key drivers, the note said, are the necessity to invest in tech to improve operations, keep pace with competitors and also for compliance. In addition, it's also laggards catching up.  “Fifth Third Bancorp, for example, indicated low double-digit growth in tech spends in CY2023. Keycorp is cutting costs in operations and investing in tech. First Horizon is ramping up tech spends to catch up after a period of underinvestment due to a merger plan with TD, which failed. Regions Financial indicated the possibility of tech spends as a percentage of revenue to go up from the current 9-11 percent,” the note read.  Analysts, however, do not expect an immediate revival in the BFS sector for Indian IT. Bendor-Samuel from Everest said that he believes things are either near or at the bottom of the current negative cycle.  “However, we don’t foresee significant improvement this year. Provided the economy does not turn bad next year, we expect growth to return next year and perhaps as early as the fourth quarter of this year,” he said.  ICICI Securities also said that a revival in BFSI is contingent on a revival in discretionary demand, something that is currently weak.    “Weak performance by Indian IT in the banking vertical is a paradox, partly explained by likely resilient spending on insourcing and cloud/SaaS consumption. Focus on expense reduction and tech modernisation at the same time can lead to large cost take-outs while discretionary spends can return post near-term headwinds,” the note read.  Insourcing in vogue  In some cases, even the resilient tech spending by the BFSI sector is not showing up in the IT companies’ revenues. This is largely because the banks are choosing to build out their own talent through captive centre investments and insourcing technology requirements from them.  According to Bendor-Samuel, as BFSI firms move into a mature digital run phase, there is a growing trend where they are looking to control the tech stack.  Kotak said in its note that in a weak environment, it is natural for companies to prioritise their own workforce and reduce consumption of third-party services.  “Demand for outsourced services can normalise once the demand environment brightens. The greater threat is a permanent shift towards insourcing, which banks such as DB have embarked on,” Kotak said.  But this isn’t expected to have a significant long-term impact on Indian IT.  “Although the GICs (global in-house centres) take work that otherwise could go to the tech services firms we do not see this trend as materially affecting the growth prospects for the Indian tech services firms. Simply put, the demand for services is too great and the need from tech services partners is accelerating as more and more of the economy is powered by digital IT,” Bendor-Samuel said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indian-it-firms-may-face-modest-impact-from-moodys-downgrade-of-us-banks-11135541.html
TCS,2023-08-09T08:40:14+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"IT deal closures face delays as clients seek pre-pandemic pricing, discounts","Discount asks have climbed to 50 percent of new deals but companies are agreeing in 30 percent of the instances, citing cost pressures","Customers of top IT services firms are seeking pre-inflationary rates and pricing concessions for both new agreements and contract renewals, amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment and cuts in discretionary technology budgets.  Even as firms such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCLTech have denied that customers were seeking any significant pricing discounts in deal negotiations during their April-June quarter earnings conferences, industry observers said it is one of the key factors for the ongoing uncertainties in demand and delays in deal closures, making it a double whammy for the IT companies.  According to market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, there was a price increase of at least 20-30 percent on transformation deals during the pandemic, a hike that clients are seeking to pare to some extent, due to uncertainty about their growth prospects.  UnearthInsight estimates that discount asks have climbed to 50 percent of new deals but companies are agreeing in 30 percent of the instances, citing cost pressures.  Phil Fersht, founder and CEO of HFS Research told Moneycontrol, “Many renewals are being delayed with clients demanding pre-inflationary prices and some even discounts. Providers have to decide if they can afford to drop their prices to keep fully utilised or stand firm and grind out the current slump.”  At the same time, Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of Everest Group, a research and management consulting firm said that despite the increasing pushback from the customers, IT services firms aren't willing to budge.  “There is an increasing pushback against the post-pandemic price increases, this can cause protracted negotiations and along with the economic uncertainty contribute to the slowdown in pipeline closing and the increase of deal delays,” he said.  “At this time we have not seen a significant rollback of the price increases pushed through in the last two years but there is a growing push to claw back some of these increases and no appetite to allow further increases,” he added.    Impact on margins  While it is hard to determine if this has started impacting margins, a look at the first-quarter earnings across the top five Indian IT firms shows a decline in operating margins except for Wipro, whose margin expanded by 112 basis points (bps) quarter on quarter (QoQ). In terms of margins and the usual commentary, Q1 is seasonally a weak quarter for IT firms, as they roll out wage hikes during this period.  Additionally, this time companies saw weakness in several key sectors including BFSI, communications, media and entertainment (CME) and telecom. Tech Mahindra, which gets nearly 40 percent of its revenue from the CME vertical, saw its margins drop by 440 bps QoQ.  UnearthInsight's founder Gaurav Vasu said discounting demands are more pronounced in new deals and with newer clients compared to existing ones.  “In 2020, when the pandemic hit, the services companies already had to do discounting. So the same discounted price continued for some time, then suddenly when the war for talent happened, the services companies went back to the clients asking for some increase in pricing. Now that the inflation pressure too is coming down, this kind of price discounting is happening in three out of 10 deals, especially with new clients,&quot; Vasu told Moneycontrol.  But company managements denied seeing any significant ask for pricing discounts so far, analysts said.  “In terms of pricing reductions, there have been some sporadic requirements from different clients but largely the pricing environment remained stable,” C Vijayakumar, CEO and MD, HCLTech, said during the company's recent earnings conference with the media.  TCS CFO Samir Seksaria maintained that the overall pricing environment remained stable for the country’s largest IT services firm, instead, there was a “year-on-year increase in realisation,” wherein prices increased to some extent.  Overall, all the companies guided for slower revenue growth and delays in deal pipeline conversion in the upcoming quarters.  Delays in deal renewals  According to UnearthInsight’s estimates, in FY24, the top five Indian IT companies including TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra will cumulatively bag between $70 billion and $85 billion worth of order book/total contract value wins. Of this, renewals will account for around 30-35 percent of the total deals.  The ongoing delays in deal closures are happening across sectors and deal sizes with the exception of artificial intelligence, which continues to remain a bright spot given the Generative AI hype, analysts said. But they also expect revival to happen soon as Fed rate hikes and inflation starts to cool down over the next two quarters.  “Deals are pushed out by 45 to 60 days right now. This is due to two factors – a lot of folks decided to take summer vacation in North America which is a rare thing and the markets had not been sure of a recession in North America. Now, they know that the recession is more than unlikely to happen,” said Ray Wang, Principal Analyst and CEO, Constellation Research.  Vasu said $100 million-plus deals have slowed down, and he expects revival to come in largely from public sector and government deals across countries. Hi-Tech and SaaS should also bounce back from Q3 FY24. Manufacturing, BFSI and healthcare are taking comparatively longer to make decisions and even deals which are won have projects getting paused/taking longer to materialise. This trend will continue for the next 4 to 5 months in FY24.  “Long-term tech transformation deals which have a 3-to-5-year execution cycle and completely new-age technologies like Metaverse or experimental tech investment from clients are either on hold or taking 5 to 8 months to close,” Vasu said.  There are a number of complications this year with deal renewals, said Bendor-Samuel. One of them is vendor consolidation, which is underway with large accounts. Vendor consolidation deals in the initial stages are usually resource-demanding and do not really leave good margins; revenue starts rolling in only after certain maturity. Thus, they are complicated to execute, taking more time, and creating a lag in revenue recognition as workloads take time to transition.  Another factor is the increased focus on cost savings which results in more Request for Proposals (RFPs) but longer procurement cycles.  “For the first half of the year, there has been a lot of indecision as firms increasingly prepared themselves for a recession. This made decision-making more difficult and more drawn out resulting in a significant slowing in pipeline closing,” he explained.  Finally and potentially most importantly new deal signings are paired with a significant reduction in discretionary spending often pre-committed in existing contracts, Bendor-Samuel said, adding, “Hence, book-to-bill ratios which are strong stand in stark contrast to revenue recognition which has slowed significantly.”  The book-to-bill ratio for IT companies is a metric used to explain the value of orders received to the value of orders completed.  Tempering inflation  Analysts have started seeing green shoots in most major geographies like North America, expecting the recovery to kick in the next few quarters.  HFS Research has predicted that with the news on inflation running at only 3 percent in the US, a recovery for IT spends could be in Q4 2023.  However, US banks still seem to be weathering a crisis, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the Signature Bank earlier this year. Global credit rating firm Moody’s on August 7 downgraded ratings of 10 small to mid-sized US banks, adding that it may further downgrade some of the US’ biggest lenders, as the sector reported pressure in profitability in its recent company earnings. BFSI is one of the largest sectors to give business to IT services companies. TCS generates nearly 35-40 percent of its revenue from this sector.  Read: Global banking crisis adds to woes of IT firms, slowdown expected in near term  Ashutosh Sharma, head of research at Forrester Research India, highlighted that the equity markets in North America and India have started to pick up.  “Equity markets have started to pick up in India and North America. Experts are seeing some green shoots appearing, expecting economies to recover and inflation to slow down. It might get delayed by a quarter or two, but there will be a recovery. For the time being, deals are getting pushed out and clients are not opening their purses easily,” he said.  Wang concurred, “Given the recent tech rallies and stock market growth, there is confidence that economic conditions are improving.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/it-deal-closures-face-delays-as-clients-seek-pre-pandemic-pricing-discounts-11128981.html
TCS,2023-08-08T13:12:09+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Centre picks TCS to transform e-Marketplace platform,"The redesigned platform will have an open API-based architecture to make it highly scalable, and able to accommodate the anticipated six-fold growth in GMV over the next six years.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on August 8 announced that it has been chosen as a strategic partner to transform the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) by bringing in more transparency and efficiency into the public procurement process.  This is the second government project the software exporter has bagged since winning the BSNL contract earlier this year. The second deal win makes TCS one of the preferred IT services firms for public scale work.  The company plans to redesign the platform for interoperability and cloud neutrality, making it technology-agnostic and vendor-independent. It will be built in an open-API-based architecture to make it highly scalable and sufficiently flexible to accommodate the anticipated six-fold growth in GMV over the next six years.  The design also aims to ease onboarding of new sellers, to get more diverse vendor base, especially SMEs /MSMEs, resulting in greater inclusivity and a more democratised access to the public sector market, the company said. The platform will have data analytics capabilities too to forecast demand and improve supply chain management along with better overall security.  The GeM platform in its current form, despite the architectural and scalability issues, is an end-to-end online marketplace for central and state government bodies, including public sector undertakings, for procurement of common use goods and services in a transparent and efficient manner.  TCS handles a Gross Merchandize Value (GMV) of over Rs 2 trillion purchased by 70,000-plus buyer groups from over 6.5 million sellers and service providers, including over 800,000 medium and small enterprises.  “In its next avatar, the GeM is envisioned to be an all-inclusive platform for government procurement, offering improved ease of doing business and transparency. With TCS as our SI partner, we are assured of architecting the new GeM with unmatched experience, rigor, and passion to develop a world class solution with resilient design, enriched user experience and innovative services,&quot; GeM chief executive PK Singh said.  &quot;We also look forward to TCS’ expertise in managing mission mode programs. We have a strong aspiration to scale up GeM to transcend geographies,” he added.  “We are proud to partner with the Government of India for the GeM platform’s digital transformation, adding to our long list of contributions to Digital India,” Tej Paul Bhatla, Business Head, Public Services – India at TCS, said.  This project will be undertaken under TCS’ Public Services India business unit which provides services to the central and state governments, building innovative technology-led solutions that enhance transparency and efficiency, and contributing to the development of Digital India.  Government partnerships  In May 2023, TCS-led a consortium which bagged a $1.8-billion deal from the government-owned telco Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to deploy 4G network across the country.  According to CEO and MD K Krithivasan, the company views such deals as an opportunity for 'nation building' and not for mere financial gains and profitability.  Unlike other IT services companies, TCS has had better track record of executing government projects. Some of its previous works include the Indian Railways’ IRCTC site, and India Post’s digital project. TCS' contract for running the Passport Seva Programme was renewed last year in a deal worth Rs 8,000 crore, according to industry sources.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/centre-picks-tcs-to-transform-e-marketplace-platform-11122181.html
TCS,2023-07-29T15:35:01+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS reverts to vertical-based operating structure in first major change under new CEO,Moneycontrol had earlier reported that several senior executives were unhappy with the previous group-wise restructuring introduced under former CEO &amp; MD Rajesh Gopinathan in April 2022. New CEO and MD K Krithivasan too kept his BFSI vertical out of that structure,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest software company, has rolled out a new operating structure, the first significant move by CEO K Krithivasan after he took charge on June 1.  TCS also rejigged its senior leadership, adding several new senior executives, global heads and veterans who have spent over 18-30 years with the company.  On July 29, the company said that based on the discussions with customers and associates over the last couple of months, TCS will be able to deliver the best value to the customers by synergising its domain and contextual knowledge across units.  &quot;In this context, we have announced the new operating structure, which regroups our existing Industry Solutions Unit (ISUs) along industry segments into key business groups. The above changes will help in deepening customer centricity, which is pivotal to our growth,&quot; a company spokesperson said in a statement.  The move appears to be a grudging reversal of the reorg that TCS unveiled earlier; while clients will still be grouped into four buckets based on their account size, they will ultimately be housed within industry verticals.  According to an internal memo sent by Krithivasan that Moneycontrol has accessed, the new operating structure will have the following business groups- BSFI Americas led by Susheel Vasudevan; BFSI UK, Europe and Australia led by Shankar NS; Communication, Media and Information Services led by Akhilesh Tiwari; Life Sciences, Healthcare, Energy, Resources and Utilities led by Debashis Ghosh; Manufacturing led by Anupam Singhal, Retail, CPG, Travel, Transportation and Hospitality led by Krishnan Ramanujam; and Technology, Software and Services under V Rajanna.  All the ISU Heads will report to the respective business group heads with no other change in the ISU structure. All the RIG (relationship incubation group) accounts will also be moved under the appropriate ISUs.  TCS has also created an Enterprise CBO (cognitive business practices) unit focussed on enterprise functions such as F &amp;amp; A (Finance &amp;amp; Accounting), HR procurement etc. This unit will also own TCS Cognix platform and will be led by Ashok Pai.  Further, another unit called TCS AI Cloud has been created combining all its public cloud units and Al initiatives. This unit will be led by Siva Ganesan with Krishna Mohan as the Deputy Head. In terms of functions, while Harrick Vin takes charge as CTO, Abhinav Kumar will take charge as CMO.  All of these roles are effective August 1 and will report directly to Krithivasan, who believes that the above changes will help in deepening customer centricity, crucial to the company’s growth amid a uncertain demand environment.  The previous restructuring plan was unveiled in April 2022 by former CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan. As per the structure, the company divided clients into four distinctive business groups depending on a client’s journey with it instead of verticals and geographies. This had become a major bone of contention for senior leaders and vertical heads.  These structures were the acquisition group, relationship incubation group, enterprise group and finally business transformation group. Each of these groups had a different head too.  People familiar with the development said that the concept of grouping clients based on the relationship maturity is being retained in the new plan, but under the umbrella of the verticalised business group. Beyond that, it's a reshuffle of responsibilities at the senior-most level. The Industry Solutions Unit (ISU) structure and customer-facing layer have not been touched.  As Moneycontrol had earlier reported, the previous group-wise restructuring had left many TCS' senior executives loath to take ownership of an account because of the likelihood of it going out of their hands once it becomes big. This caused unrest among senior executives, especially vertical heads who had no power over their P&amp;amp;L (profit and loss).  Krithivasan himself had kept his banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical out of the previous structure. BFSI accounts for nearly 35-40 percent of the company's overall revenue.  Analysts Moneycontrol spoke to welcomed the move, since this is closer to TCS' previous operating structure and empowers industry heads who were unhappy with the reorg.  New appointments  TCS also made several leadership appointments and changes.  The company's chief marketing officer, Rajashree R, will be stepping down from her senior management personnel (SMP) position on July 31. According to her LinkedIn profile, she has transitioned to become a Vice-President.  Sources told Moneycontrol that Abhinav Kumar, a TCS veteran who has been with the company for over 21 years, will be taking over the role as the new chief marketing and communications officer for its global markets. Prior to this, he was in the same role but focussed only on the Europe market.  Company's chief technology officer (CTO) K Ananth Krishnan is retiring on July 31.  Apart from this, Harrick Vin, Shankar Narayanan, V Rajanna, Siva Ganesan, Ashok Pai and Reguraman (Regu) Ayyaswamy will be appointed as SMPs effective from August 1. All of them have been with TCS for over 18-32 years.  Vin takes over as the CTO post Ananth Krishnan's retirement from August 1.  Challenging business environment  All of these changes come at a time when the company is already weathering multiple challenges including macroeconomic uncertainties and dealing with a recruitment bribe case.  In a post earnings interview with Moneycontrol a few weeks back, Krithivasan said that achieving double-digit growth this year could be challenging as clients remain cautious in an uncertain demand environment.  Last month, TCS had sacked six employees and banned six major staffing firms after the employees were found to be taking bribes by giving preferential treatment to certain staffing for recruiting subcontracted employees. The company is also investigating its entire supply management following this incident.  TCS was again in the eye of storm when it was found to be deferring onboarding of over 200 lateral hires by more than three months.  On the deal win front, despite a challenging environment, TCS bagged back-to-back mega deals of over $700 million plus in the United Kingdom, including both through renewals and new clients.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-reverts-to-vertical-based-operating-structure-first-major-change-under-new-ceo-11057021.html

TCS,2023-07-18T14:08:01+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra,"Tatas, Hindujas among 40 groups with concentrated FPI holdings. Here’s the list","While the FPIs include kosher companies, public retail funds or pension funds, there are some about which little is known","About 100 foreign portfolio investors have more than 50 percent of their Indian investments in a single corporate group. Such investments have been made in companies of about 40 groups, including the Hindujas, Adani, GMR, and the Tatas.  Such FPIs with concentrated holdings are defined as 'high-risk', by the regulator unless they are public retail funds, sovereign wealth funds or pension funds.  These ‘high-risk’ FPIs, as defined by SEBI, had investments of Rs 33,223 crore in the Adani group, Rs 18,210 crore in the Hinduja group, Rs 7,871 crore in the OP Jindal group, and Rs 2,301 crore in the Tata group as of March end, according to data culled by Prime Database.      These numbers are an under representation of opaque structures as they include only FPIs with greater than 1 percent holding in a company. According to the regulations, entities with less than 1 percent exposure in a company are not required to make any disclosure regarding their investments. The data is based on shareholding at the end of March quarter.  On June 29, the Securities Exchange Board of India said FPIs with 50 percent group concentration or those with more than Rs 25,000 crore invested in the Indian equity market will have to provide additional disclosures regarding their ownership, economic interest and control.  The FPIs include Societe Generale, Morgan Stanley, General Atlantic, Google and Warburg Pincus. Among the lesser-known FPIs are Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund, Moon Capital, ASN Investments, and Ishana Capital Master Fund.  According to the data, it is the lesser-known entities that have their entire India investment in a single group. Five FPIs – ASN Investments, Veda Investors, Deccan Value, A/D Investors Fund and C/D Investors Fund have 100 percent exposure to the GMR group.  Ishana Capital Master Fund, SFSPVI, and Dragsa have 100 percent exposure to the Hinduja group.  About 51 such entities have entire exposure to a single group.  Sebi has exempted government and government-related investors, pension funds, public retail funds and some listed exchange-traded funds from making the additional disclosures.  Sebi’s goal is to prevent violation of minimum public shareholding rules and opportunistic takeovers using the FPI route, and to plug gaps in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and Foreign Institutional Investor Regulations.  According to Punit Shah, a partner at Dhruva Advisors, this will address a couple of situations. First, it will monitor and control foreign investments from certain neighbouring countries, which require government approval. Second, it is intended to track any roundtripping – the routing of promoters’ investments in group companies through FPIs.  Under Press Note 3, the government made prior approval mandatory for foreign investment from countries that share a land border with India. Sebi mentions this point in its regulation.  Why is tracking promoter investment important? According to dealers, several promoters set up offshore funds, register them as FPIs and use them to hold shares in their companies. This way, they end up with not only the promoter holding but a part of the public shareholding as well. These opaque structures make manipulation of prices easier.  This is why Sebi wants additional disclosures to establish the identity of the ultimate beneficial owners in the case of ‘high-risk’ FPIs, without any shareholding threshold or exception. While this is a step in the right direction, Moin Ladha, a partner at Khaitan &amp;amp; Co., said it might put off genuine FPIs.  “The basic idea of an FPI is portfolio investment. Not all investors – we are speaking of genuine investors – may be comfortable with the granular information required to be provided with respect to their portfolio investments,” he said.  According to Sebi’s estimates, about Rs 2.6 lakh crore, or about 6 percent of the total FPI equity assets and less than 1 percent of India’s equity market capitalisation, may potentially be identified as high risk, meeting either the 50 percent group concentration or the Rs 25,000 crore fund size thresholds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tatas-hindujas-among-40-groups-with-concentrated-fpi-holdings-heres-the-list-10979911.html

TCS,2023-07-14T14:43:30+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,HCLTech skips salary hikes for management level staff in FY24,The IT services major is also delaying compensation review for the junior to mid-level employees by a quarter.,"HCLTech is skipping compensation review entirely for salary hikes of senior management level employees for the fiscal year 2024, which forms a significant part of the company’s wage bill. This development comes as the country’s third largest IT services firm is facing a tough business environment and reported weak June quarter performance this week.  Speaking to analysts during the company’s earnings conference, CEO and MD, C Vijayakumar said, “This year, we have made a decision to skip the compensation review, starting with the management layer, which is E4+, and also defer for junior to mid-level people by a quarter, which is E3 and below levels.&quot;  According to CFO Prateek Aggarwal, the E4+ layer which includes the senior most staff, also forms a significant portion of the company’s wage bill.  Regarding junior to mid-level staff, Chief People Officer Ramachandran Sundararajan said, “Typically, this time of the year, we make our announcements on pay reviews. Last couple of years the hiring that we have done and the compensation reviews that we have done, we have taken that into consideration and have taken a decision to defer our annual reviews by a quarter.”  HCLTech reported big misses on several counts in Q1FY24, against analyst estimates. One of the key metric missed was the EBIT margin which fell to 16.9 percent in Q1, down from 18.2 percent in the previous quarter. Aggarwal added that nearly 36 bps of fall in the margins were driven by lower utilisation rates in Q1.  The company also reported a decline of 2,506 employees in its total headcount in Q1, while choosing not to back fill attrition.  Improving utilisation rates will be a key component to ensure improvement in operating margins which will eventually help the company achieve its guidance of exiting FY24 with an 18-19 percent margin, Vijayakumar told Moneycontrol during an interview.  Not just HCLTech, peers Infosys and Wipro too are delaying pay hikes. As of now Wipro is holding up its wage hike cycle until the third quarter or the December quarter, unlike last fiscal when hikes were rolled out in the September quarter.  Wipro will also be paying out only 80 percent of the variable pay to its junior level employees in Q1, which is linked to the company’s overall performance.  Infosys too has deferred pay hikes, which is generally rolled out to employee levels below the senior management in April and to the senior management in July. Employees of both of these segments didn't received any communication from the company on these delays.  Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) turned out be an outlier this time as it has already kick started its promotion cycle, having offered 12-15 percent hikes to its exceptional performers effective from April 1. TCS, however, has deferred onboarding of over 200 lateral hires with two to 15 years of experience until October citing uncertainty and delays in project commencement.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hcltech-skips-salary-hikes-for-management-level-staff-in-fy24-10960151.html

Instead, the company's objective is focused on &quot;nation building,&quot; aligning with TCS's strategic approach to government projects, which emphasises more than just profit margins.  During an interview with Moneycontrol, Krithivasan stated, &quot;When considering the aspect of making money from the BSNL deal, there are two dimensions to consider. In the case of India, our perspective goes beyond mere financial gains. We consider ourselves an integral part of the nation-building process. We embrace this responsibility wholeheartedly, with our primary focus being on contributing to the development of our nation.&quot;  “And so we believe that if TCS cannot do it who else can. For certain programs which nobody else can do, we cannot be asking whether we are making money, as long as we are not losing money,” he added.  A consortium led by TCS recently bagged an Advance Purchase Order (APO) valued at over Rs 15,000 crore (around $1.8 billion) from BSNL to deploy 4G networks across India. The consortium also includes Tata Group's telecom gear-making company Tejas Networks, which will be responsible for supplying and servicing the Radio Access Networks (RAN) equipment.  TCS’ approach towards government projects has always been a bit different compared to its other IT companies. The company has shown a better track record and success rate too in the industry for running public-facing government services portals.  TCS uses these projects as training grounds to learn from the complexity and replicate this in projects for various countries. The IT services firm doesn’t focus on profit margins alone for such deals, the key takeaway remains the understanding of scale that comes from working on these projects.  It already successfully runs the Indian Railways’ IRCTC site, and India Post’s digital project. TCS' contract for running the Passport Seva Programme was renewed last year in a deal worth Rs. 8,000 crores, according to industry sources.  While for the overall IT services sector where the US and Europe are the key markets, India contributes less than 5 percent of the top IT firms’ revenue. Among them, TCS reported the highest contribution of revenue coming from India at 5 percent in FY23.  In comparison, Infosys earned 3.2 percent and Wipro reported 4 percent revenue from India respectively in FY23.  TCS reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on July 12. The company’s performance remained muted on several counts amid increasing pressure in key segments such as financial services, hi-tech and telecom. The EBIT margins too were 130 bps to 23.2% on a QoQ basis, far from its aspirational 26-28% range.  The company’s revenue in dollar terms stood at $7.22 billion, in line with analyst estimates. Overall revenue growth for Q1 came in at 0.4 percent, its slowest in a decade excluding the Covid period, but the subdued earnings were on expected lines.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bsnl-deal-is-not-about-making-money-its-for-nation-building-tcs-ceo-k-krithivasan-10952141.html

While it posted better revenue growth of 12.6% on a YoY basis, it nonetheless was the lowest in the last 12 quarters. The company reported operating profits of Rs 13,755 Cr with operating margins at 23.2% (a decline of 130 Bps). This was on account of wage hikes, higher visa and other operating costs. Attrition levels did drop by 220bps but they stood at 17.8%, looming concerns over the company’s execution efficiency in the future. The management commentary on the verticals BFSI, Hi-tech Media, Life Sciences, and Retail was cautious. Furthermore, it expects the company to report moderate growth in the near term. On a brighter note, deal-wins for the quarter continued strong and remained high. Moreover, deal wins were spread across verticals and across geographies and stood at $10.2 Bn (BFSI TCV at $3 Bn, Retail TCV at $1.2 Bn). However, TCS expects technology spending to remain resilient and expects the secular tailwinds to drive healthy growth over the medium term to long term.

In response to a question at the company's Q1FY24 earnings conference on July 12, Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said that it will continue to honour all offers it has made.  &quot;There are certain delays because of the environment we are in because of the project delays...things are not getting progressed [in some cases]. As a result of that, the onboarding of those associates also gets delayed. In certain cases that is getting delayed, yes, but that is purely based on the project's budget situation. I commit today that we are going to honour all offers,&quot; Lakkad said.  Moneycontrol first reported on the delays in onboarding lateral hires by TCS on July 10. Joinees with experience anywhere from less than two years to up to 15 years were told that their date of joining will be postponed by a quarter or three months amidst project commencement delays, those impacted told Moneycontrol.  Over 200 lateral recruits across cities such as Bangalore, Pune, Kochi, Bhubaneswar, Delhi NCR, and Indore, to name a few, are getting impacted by these deferments.

This is coming at a time when the Indian IT sector has already taken a hit by macroeconomic headwinds and is facing project deferrals and ramp-downs as their clients cut down on tech budgets.  Over 200 lateral recruits across cities including Bangalore, Pune, Kochi, Bhubaneswar, Delhi NCR, and Indore to name a few are impacted by the delays.  These joinees were hired between January and April and were initially facing onboarding delays by a month. Many of them got two to three subsequent new joining dates. On July 10, however, many received emails stating that their joining dates are getting pushed to October.  The information about a deferral in onboarding date hasn’t even been communicated proactively to those waiting to join the company, according to multiple people Moneycontrol spoke to.  One of the impacted employees who has over 10 years of experience, was recruited for a particular project. In fact, he tells Moneycontrol that the company repeatedly followed up with him during his notice period to ensure that he was joining, but come last week, there was no word on his onboarding formalities.  “It’s when I started following up with them that I got to know that my onboarding date has been deferred. When I asked them what the reason was, they said they were informed by the management last week that onboarding will be done in phases. But they aren’t confirming any date,” he says.  Having worked with several IT majors, he adds that he has never seen these kinds of issues in other companies.  “I’m jobless now and I’m looking out again. In the current market, getting a job at my level of experience is also very tough. There’s a family to take care of, kids, loans on my head. It’s a very tough situation. I can hardly manage for a month,” he says.  Another impacted joinees was hired at a 65 percent pay hike from a rival top IT firm. This person’s last date at the previous organisation was in the fourth week of May.  “They were hiring aggressively in January and February. They offered good hikes too. My last day of work was in the fourth week of May in the previous organisation. And I was to join TCS in the second week of June. Suddenly in mid-May, I received an email from HR that my new joining date will be in the second week of July because of project commencement issues,” the person told Moneycontrol seeking anonymity.  “My family and colleagues advised me to wait given TCS’ good reputation. The company also started re-onboarding people after June 20. Until today, July 10, onboarding happened. But I got a call later in the day saying that my joining has been deferred to the next quarter, to the first week of October. I have a family to feed, how will I manage? I have started looking out for jobs now,” the person added.  According to TCS’ LinkedIn page, the company has around 5,296 open jobs to be filled in. Queries sent to TCS didn’t elicit any response at the time of publishing and will be updated if the company chooses to respond.  A third employee with less than two years of experience has seen his onboarding date changed for the fourth time, after being laid off by his previous company earlier this year. When he asked the reason behind the same, he was informed that this was a decision taken by the top management.  Upon reaching out over a possible onboarding delay, those waiting have received emails stating that as discussed, their date of joining is rescheduled and that the new date will be reflected on TCS’ portal later.  Grappling with hiring scam  This development is happening while TCS is already grappling with another major hiring scam that came to light less than a month ago. Several staffing firms were found to be bribing senior TCS executives in the company’s Resource Management Group (RMG) which outsources and deploys temporary associates on a project basis, to get preferential business opportunities.  In relation to this, TCS sacked six employees and banned six staffing firms. Another three employees are being investigated.  TCS chairman N Chandrasekaran also said that the company is now looking into the entire supply management process to examine “what the weaknesses are, and will completely tidy the process to ensure that they do not have such incidents.”  Volatility in demand  Even as TCS bagged a few major deals and renewals with its existing UK clients, Chandrasekaran had alluded to difficulties and volatility in demand from customers in the near term.  “When there is uncertainty in the global economic situation and higher inflation or slowing growth, companies will calibrate their spending. Whether it will happen in this quarter or after two quarters, it will happen. So certain discretionary spending companies will make a choice. It also depends on the amount of capital they want to spend at this point in time,” he had said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-delays-onboarding-of-lateral-recruits-by-up-to-three-months-10935121.html
TCS,2023-07-10T12:41:06+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS Q1FY24 Earnings| Five things to watch out for,"The earnings will be the first under new CEO K Krithivasan, who has taken over the helm at a time when the IT sector is grappling with slowing demand and macroeconomic challenges, which have forced clients to rethink their  tech budgets.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is set to kickstart the IT sector earnings season on July 12. This will be the first quarter its new CEO K Krithivasan directly addressing the earnings conference. All eyes will be on Krithivasan’s commentary on his vision for the company and any likely strategy changes.  Analysts expect the first quarter ended June 30, 2023 will be subdued for all IT companies, with slowing demand and several macroeconomic challenges leading to client companies rethinking tech budgets. Cost take out deals and vendor consolidation deals will still continue to drive demand.  EBIT margins or operating margins for most companies are expected to remain flat while, TCS will see a decline due to its recent wage hikes.  Here are the five themes to watch out for in TCS Q1 earnings performance:  Revenue Growth  According to analyst estimates, TCS will report flat to 0.2 percent revenue growth QoQ in constant currency terms, hit by weak discretionary spending, projects being put on hold and other macroeconomic challenges in geographies like North America and Continental Europe.  The company also missed its EBIT margin guidance of 25 percent in Q4 touching 24.5 percent, this might slip further by 80-90 bps in Q1FY24, driven by wage hikes announced in April. Whether the company will now update its margin guidance or stick to the previous benchmark and the available levers that would propel the company’s margins in the future.  Demand Outlook  During its recent AGM, Chairman N Chandrasekaran already cautioned shareholders of the uncertainties in the global economic situation, higher inflation etc. He said that client companies will calibrate their spending in the near-term, depending on the sizes of their allocated tech budgets.  While he is bullish in the mid- to long-term, there is a slowdown expected in discretionary spending in the near term. Commentary on sectors like BFSI, retail and telecom which have already showed decline in revenue growth in the past four quarters, will be watched out for.  Having said that, TCS bagged several billion dollar plus and long-term deals in the United Kingdom this quarter. This include a $1.1 billion deal from UK’s NEST, a $1 billion plus deal with Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, a 10-year contract with UK’s Teacher’s Pension Scheme and another deal with the Phoenix Group to name a few. Closer home, a consortium led by TCS won a deal from government owned telco BSNL with an advance purchase order of $1.8 billion.  Amidst all of these deals, TCS also lost a $2 billion deal and a 10-year contract from US-based Transamerica Life Insurance, which it got in 2018.  “Demand uncertainty seen in month of March has continued in Jun’23 quarter. TCS is seeing some project cancellations and postponements. Some right-shifted projects have started ramping up in June. Europe and UK are growing well while there is more weakness in North America,” analysts at ICICI Securities.  TCS so far maintained its quarterly total contract value of deals in its guidance of $7-9 billion.  Push for AI offerings  TCS is largely focusing on its newer technology offerings like artificial intelligence for next phase of growth.  Krithivasan in the company’s annual report said, “As part of their continuing digital transformation journey, we see sustained focus on cloud adoption, data architecture, customer experience and business model transformation.”  “On top of these current focus areas, technologies like 5G, IoT, generative AI, virtual reality / metaverse, digital twin and others are also gaining attention and are likely to attract investments in the short to medium term,” he added.  TCS recently partnered with Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure Open AI to develop industry-specific use cases. TCS even launched its own generative AI offering, and plans to train 25,000 employees in AI technology apart from the 50,000 existing associates.  Sectorial pressures  Sectors like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), tech and communications, retail and manufacturing have shown a steady decline in quarterly revenue growth over the past four quarters.  BFSI, which contributes around 35-40 percent of TCS’ revenue, was also hit by the global banking crisis earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and the First Republic Bank in the US. Though there were no direct impact on TCS’ business, clients in the BFSI sector are slowing down tech spending.  As clients increasingly cut down on discretionary spending, telecom, tech and communications are taking a hit.  Hiring trends  TCS added 22,600 employees in FY23, a significant decrease from the 1.03 lakh net employee addition in FY22. Indian IT companies have been stating that the co-relation between revenue growth and hiring have started to become non-linear, as these companies increase focus on improving utilisation of the existing talent.  During TCS’ earnings conference last quarter, CHRO Milind Lakkad had shared that the company has already rolled out offers to 46,000 freshers for the FY24. In the past couple of quarters, TCS had steadily decreased its attrition rates. Lakkad expects TCS will reach its pre-pandemic attrition rate of 12-13 percent by the second half of FY24.  Unlike delays and variable pay cuts seen with certain peers, TCS has been consistent in paying out timely variable pay, at least for the junior staff. Last quarter, the company paid out 100 percent of the variable pay and said that the upcoming hikes for high performers will be at 12-15 percent, as is standard. Other hike bands are 8 percent, 5 percent and 1.5 percent.  While last fiscal year was the time for bettering utilisation rates, this year could be about ramping up and training talent to meet demand for AI projects. As the first quarter of the fiscal year, hiring targets will be of utmost focus.

TCS,2023-06-30T14:07:23+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"TCS and Infosys AGMs: What Chandrasekaran, Nilekani said on AI, demand concerns","While both companies expect demand volatility and uncertainty in the short-term, they expect artificial intelligence to drive growth in the medium and the long term","Artificial intelligence (AI), the new tech frontier, has emerged as the key theme for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and rival Infosys as well and is expected to drive growth for India’s top two IT consultancy services as demand concerns weigh.  At their annual general meetings (AGMs), held a day apart, TCS and Infosys also agreed that the overall demand environment is expected to remain volatile amid macro-economic challenges.  Chairman N Chandrasekaran said that TCS was shifting gears to be more AI-centric.  “Over the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital technologies, bringing about a transformation across every industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition a central focus…There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI,” he said on June 29.  Despite a volatile demand environment, at least in the short term, Chandrasekaran was bullish in the long term on growing adoption of predictive AI, generative AI, cloud and IoT by its client companies -- all the areas he believes TCS is strong in.  A day earlier, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh told shareholders that the company had already bagged 50 generative AI projects.  “We have today 50 active client projects where we are using generative AI and this is becoming an increasing part of the new world which is going to be defined on an AI-first basis,” he said.  Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani did flag practical, ethical and intellectual property-related concerns surrounding generative AI.  Chandrasekaran had a similar response when asked about the challenges of generative AI. He concurred that every technology has to be used responsibly, adding, “Countries across the globe will regulate generative AI to be used responsibly.”  In May, TCS and Infosys launched their generative AI offerings TCS Generative AI and Infosys Topaz.  Volatile demand environment  Infosys has already pegged its constant currency revenue growth guidance for FY24 in single digits at 4-7 percent.  Responding to shareholders, Nilekani said though the receding coronavirus pandemic ended one set of challenges, its aftermath created new ones.  “The cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency to resilience and security, all morphing quickly and without warning is upon us,” he said, adding they must be flexible.  TCS doesn’t give forward guidance but Chandrasekaran said he was bullish in the mid-to long-term as the company was well-positioned to capture the opportunities and growth coming from trends like artificial intelligence, energy transition, supply-chain shift and the need for new skills.  “I believe that the growth for medium to long term is going to be strong. But in the nearby quarters there will be volatility in different markets on customer spending, especially in discretionary projects. It will go across sectors—some places it will be BFSI, others it will be manufacturing or retail,” he said.  In times of uncertain global economic situation, higher inflation or slowing growth, companies would calibrate their spending, he said. “Whether it will happen in this quarter or after two quarters, it will happen. So certain discretionary spending companies will make a choice. It also depends on the amount of capital they want to spend at this point in time,” Chandrasekaran said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-and-infosys-agms-what-chandrasekaran-nilekani-said-on-ai-demand-concerns-10882621.html
TCS,2023-06-29T20:38:39+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Volatility expected in near-term on customer spending: TCS Chairman N Chandrasekaran,"Key growth drivers for TCS in FY23 were M&amp;A integration or divestitures, product or business model innovation, customer experience transformation, and data &amp; analytics for improved decision-making. ","Even as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) remains resilient, the IT services major will see volatility in demand in the near term across different markets and customer spending, said chairman N Chandrasekaran, at a time when macroeconomic challenges are making the business environment tougher for IT services companies globally.  “I believe that the growth for medium to long term is going to be strong. But in the nearby quarters there will be volatility in different markets on customer spending, especially in discretionary projects. It will go across sectors—some places it will be BFSI, others it will be manufacturing or retail,” he told shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) on June 29.  According to Chandrasekaran, despite the near-term challenges the company is well-positioned to capture the opportunities and growth coming from trends like artificial intelligence, energy transition and supply chain shift and need for new skills and talent of the future. All of this will help the company grow eventually.  “Overall, whether it is cloud, IoT, predictive AI, generative AI etc., these are trends that augur extremely well for the company,” he said.  “Having said that, when there is uncertainty in the global economic situation and higher inflation or slowing growth, companies will calibrate their spending. Whether it will happen in this quarter or after two quarters, it will happen. So certain discretionary spending companies will make a choice. It also depends on the amount of capital they want to spend at this point in time,” Chandrasekaran observed.  FY23 performance  TCS remained resilient in terms of orders despite the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and geo-political tensions that have disrupted the smooth functioning of global supply chains.  “There has been a surge in inflation, especially in the developed markets. In this environment, the demand for your company’s services has shown remarkable resilience,” he said.  CEO K Krithivasan said, “Despite the macroeconomic overhang throughout the year, we recorded a strong order book throughout the year with a total TCV of $34.1 billion. It is important to note that we exited the year with an order book of $10 billion, the strongest in the four quarters, despite the banking crisis in the US and the resultant uncertainty.”  The company’s strong revenue growth came with industry-leading profitability, he said.  Key growth drivers in FY23 were M&amp;amp;A integration or divestitures, product or business model innovation, customer experience transformation, and data and analytics for improved decision-making. Cloud transformation too continues to aid growth with an emphasis on execution.  Bullish on AI  Chandrasekaran remained bullish on AI and said that TCS is now becoming more AI-centric.  “Over the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital technologies, bringing about a transformation across every industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition a central focus…There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI,” he said.  The majority of businesses are still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT, Chandrasekaran said. There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors.  2023 so far  In the first six months of 2023, the company has managed to grab five large deals in the United Kingdom, where the company is the largest IT and software services provider.  These deals include a $1.1 billion contract with UK’s Nest, the $723-million deal from insurer Phoenix Group, the Marks &amp;amp; Spencer deal and the 10-year contract with the Teacher’s Pension Scheme in England and Wales, amidst a challenging macro environment in the region.  Meanwhile, in the US, a $2-billion deal and a 10-year contract with Transamerica Life Insurance were terminated, citing macro environment challenges and changing business priorities. TCS got the deal in 2018 and the pending work will be wrapped up in the next two and a half years.  Closer home, in India, a consortium led by TCS bagged a $1.8 billion deal for government-owned telco Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL).",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/volatility-expected-in-near-term-on-customer-spending-tcs-chairman-n-chandrasekaran-10879171.html
TCS,2023-06-29T18:27:42+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"TCS sacked six employees, banned six staffing firms in recruitment bribe case: N Chandrasekaran","Speaking at the TCS AGM, chairman N Chandrasekaran detailed the entire investigation process adding that three more employees are still being investigated and the company is currently auditing its entire recruitment supply chain.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) banned around six employees and six business associate (BA) firms or staffing firms in relation to the recruitment bribe case, said chairman N Chandrasekaran, addressing several reports and shareholder queries on the issue that came up during the IT services major’s annual general meeting (AGM) on June 29.  This was the first time that the senior-most executive from the company openly spoke about the entire investigation process in the case and the way forward, coming after nearly a week of discussions and speculations on the case.  Speaking to the shareholders, Chandrasekaran said, “We found six employees who did not follow ethical conduct. While we cannot quantify what favours they got but they certainly behaved in a way that they were favouring certain firms. We have banned all those six employees and six such BA companies. There are investigations pending on three more employees.”  The company is also looking at the whole BA supply management process to examine what the weaknesses are, and will completely tidy the process to ensure that we do not have such incidents, he said.  “For a Tata Group company, the most important thing expected of every employee is ethical conduct and integrity in operations. That comes ahead of any financial performance. So whenever there is a violation of ethical conduct by any employee, it pains me and all the leaders very deeply. We take it extremely seriously and will take very strong actions,” Chandrasekaran added.  What transpired?  According to Chandrasekaran, the wrongdoings were first pointed out by two whistle blowers in February and March.  “The complaints were about certain favouritism done and favours received in recruitment of business associates,” he said.  TCS has two departments for acquiring talent: the HR and talent acquisition which hires people and resource allocation group which deploys available resources into projects. Whenever there is a talent shortage or a particular skill is not available in a location, the company has a set of BA firms to get contract employees.  “At any point in time in the overall deployment of resources, about 2-3 percent of them are such BAs or contractors. The complaint was related to certain individuals in the company working with certain BA firms to be recruiting in their favour,” Chandrasekaran said.  He added, “There are a large number of BA firms that TCS works with. There is a rigorous process in the company to recruit or qualify a firm to be called a BA firm. There are about a little over 1,000 such firms globally because we need resources in 55 such countries. And each one of them does a certain amount of business depending on their skill availability.”  TCS ultimately found two such cases: one in India and the other one in the US. The India one was investigated by a senior executive in the company and the US one by an external official.  No key managerial person involved  Over the past few days, TCS had reportedly blacklisted several partnering staffing firms and sacked employees from its Resource Management Group (RMG) division in relation to allegedly charging commissions from the staffing firms in return of preferential treatment by giving them business.  Sources had earlier told Moneycontrol that the RMG division brought less than 1 percent of the company’s overall workforce and the financial impact arising out of these violations is likely to be minimal.  TCS later denied the allegations in a statement. &quot;The recruitment activities in TCS are not handled by the Resource Management Group (RMG) as alleged, therefore the reference to alleged scam in recruitment process is incorrect,&quot; it said.  The company had run an internal investigation on these charges after a whistle blower alerted CEO K Krithivasan and COO Natarajan Ganapathy Subramaniam. Sharing the findings of the same, TCS said that the issue relates to &quot;breach of Company’s Code of Conduct by certain employees and vendors providing contractors; and no key managerial person of the Company has been found to be involved.&quot;  It does not involve &quot;any fraud by or against the Company and (has) no financial impact,&quot; it added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-banned-six-employees-six-staffing-firms-in-recruitment-bribe-case-says-chairman-n-chandrasekaran-10878241.html

The new project comes four months after the IT services major won a $723-million deal from the Phoenix Group, which is the UK's largest long-term savings and retirements provider.  While TCS did not disclose the deal size, sources said, this will be a big-ticket contract for the company and also marks its entry in the insurance space in Continental Europe.  TCS had earlier digitally transformed the operating model of another Phoenix Group UK subsidiary, Diligenta, in which it administers more than 10 million policies.  &quot;The two organisations are keen to replicate this successful model, extending the same enhanced digital experience to policyholders in Germany and Austria, and thereafter in other European markets,&quot; TCS said.  With this partnership with SLIDAC, TCS will set up a customer operations centre in Germany, and &quot;a future-ready life and pensions digital platform for Germany and Austria, with capabilities to extend into other European markets&quot;.  TCS will initially transform and migrate more than 400,000 policies comprising SLIDAC’s German and Austrian life and pension books to its platform, and create comprehensive, omnichannel, journey-based digital experiences for policyholders and advisors.  The IT firm will enable SLIDAC to launch innovative products more quickly, improve risk management and controls, and strengthen regulatory compliance, the company said.  The initiative is also aimed at helping SLIDAC and Phoenix Group to quickly respond to changes in its European markets and seize new opportunities for growth.  “Leveraging the advantages of our strategic relationship with TCS, a leading global organisation, will support our growth strategy in Europe and bring benefits to both our customers and advisers. This is a real opportunity to help us accelerate our ability to innovate and efficiently evolve our customer proposition in the future,” Nigel Dunne, CEO of Standard Life International DAC, said.  “We are delighted to expand our long-standing partnership with the Phoenix Group to include SLIDAC’s policyholders in Europe, and extend to them, the same digital omnichannel experiences that have made us a market leader in the United Kingdom,&quot; R Vivekanand, President of BFSI Products and Platforms at TCS, said.

Citing an executive of the company, the report also said the “scandal” may have involved Rs 100 crore.  However, TCS in a statement said that its recruitment activities are not handled by the RMG.  “RMG is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects and in case of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors.

While E.S. Chakravarthy, the global head of RMG was sent on leave, one of the four other employees sacked included Arun GK who was heading one of the functions in the team, for taking commission from these HR firms, Mint said.

Sources told Moneycontrol, that these irregularities cited were US-centric, wherein TCS invested nearly a billion dollars to hire employees. All the three hiring firms are based in India and have offices in the US.  “Each of these US staffing partners make an average 25 percent margin on each hiring contract. This is actually a very rampant trend in the overall IT sector where the staffing companies end up paying one percent in commission to the procurement guys in the client company,” one of the sources cited above said, seeking anonymity.  “Around 80 percent of the subcontracting costs for the IT companies are coming from the US region,” the source added.  Another source said that the investigation was in fact going on for nearly four months.  According to the Mint report, the RMG division has an estimated headcount of 3,000 and places around 1,400 engineers including new hires on projects. TCS ended FY23 with 614,795 employees and $27.93 billion in revenue.  The news comes over a week after the TCS reported that a $2-billion deal for a period of 10-year was cancelled by the US-based Transamerica Life Insurance, citing macro environment challenges and changing business priorities. TCS got the deal in 2018 and the pending work will be wrapped up in the next two and a half years.

The IT giant's hints at demand taking a hit also left the market on the edge.

Catch up on all LIVE stock market updates here  Accenture Results  Accenture reported a revenue of $16.56 billion, up over 5 percent on-year in constant currency terms. Despite good growth in Q3, the IT major has lowered the upper end of its FY23 revenue growth guidance band to 8-9 percent YoY in constant currency terms from 8-10 percent earlier.  The company has guided for a 2-6 percent YoY growth for Q4 in constant currency terms, implying a sequential decline of 4.9 percent to 1.3 percent.  At the lower end of the guidance, the company expects further deterioration in small-sized deal sales, CMT as well as North America. This, according to analysts, is negative as there was an expectation that there would be some stabilisation in stressed verticals from June.  The management highlighted the impact on the demand environment from adverse macro fundamentals, delays in small and discretionary deals, and a dip in deal pricing in few segments, all of which hint at a drag on near-term growth for the sector.  Deal booking remained soft at $17.3 billion, up 4 percent YoY in constant currency terms and 1 percent YoY in US dollar terms.  Read more | Voltas tumbles after UBS downgrades stock, slashes target price  What analysts are reading?  Analysts expect a negative near-term impact for the Indian IT players.  Nomura said guidance revision indicates a moderation in demand. It has retained its cautious stance on the sector. “We remain concerned on the demand outlook for the Indian IT services and expect approximately 480 basis points slower revenue growth (at 6.1 percent YoY) in FY24 vs FY23 for large-caps,” it said.  A soft first half is anticipated for the Indian IT players, said JM Financial Institutional Services. Given that Accenture’s outlook is only till August, it offers little incremental read-through for the Indian IT. However, a potential deterioration in smaller discretionary projects, CMT vertical and North America suggest that demand has not bottomed, the brokerage firm cautioned.  JM Financial Institutional Services highlighted that weakness in discretionary - CMT and North America - has a negative implication for players with higher exposure to these segments, especially LTIMindtree, Persistent Systems and Tech Mahindra. Plus, higher exposure to discretionary also puts Infosys at risk.  Morgan Stanley noted that Accenture's Q3 earnings showed lower order intake. The brokerage firm has maintained its cautious stance for the Indian technology players in the first half of FY24. It added that a commentary around dampening in small projects has brought to the fore concerns about slowdown in the sector.  Jefferies also noted that discretionary IT spends were still under pressure and that Q1 is softer than expected. It pointed out that the recent channel checks and interactions with companies point to a worsening demand outlook.  Rising risks to demand recovery in the second half of FY24 could lead to further de-rating, Jefferies said while cutting its growth estimates for FY24 by 50-150 basis points.  JPMorgan said Accenture cutting guidance for FY23 and Q4 hinted at a tough macro environment. The foreign brokerage firm added that the guidance implies no growth recovery by the year-end, leading to a weak Q2 for the Indian IT.

While it has remained negative on the entire sector, a weakness in CMT is negative for Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree and Persistent Systems.

The domestic brokerage firm has maintained its positive stance on the sector, and expects a sustainable strong demand environment to drive strong earnings growth over the next three years.  How ICICI Securities read the trimming of guidance was that since September 2022 when the IT major issued FY23 guidance, the mid-point of guidance has been lowered by only 50 basis points over the last 10 months, despite deteriorating macros such as persistent high inflation, banking crisis in March 2023 among others, which means technology demand remains resilient.  Large deal momentum continues to be strong with 26 large deal wins for the company in April 2023 quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Accenture has won 85 large deals, 11 more than last year, the brokerage firm pointed out.

This is TCS’ fourth large deal from the region in 2023, following the $723-million deal from Phoenix Group, the Marks &amp; Spencer deal and a 10-year contract with the Teacher’s Pension Scheme, amid a challenging macro environment.","IT services giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) announced the expansion of its partnership with National Employment Savings Trust, UK’s largest workplace pension scheme in a £840 million (around $1.1 billion) deal over an initial tenure of 10 years, wherein it will digitally transform the firm’s administration services to deliver enhanced member experiences.  The total maximum estimated value of the contract, if extended to the entirety of its 18-year tenure, will be £1.5 billion (around $1.9 billion).  &quot;The contract will be for a minimum term of 10 years, with an optional extension period of up to 5 years, and the option of an additional period of up to 3 years for exit. The total contract value is indicative and covers this potential 18 year period,&quot; a Nest spokesperson said.  This contract was earlier with French IT services firm Atos which was cancelled in early 2023, just two years into a potential 18-year team, The Register had reported.  The news website had added that the collapse of this contract may lead as many as 1,000 Atos job losses in the UK and India.  This is TCS’ fourth large deal from the region in 2023, following the $723-million deal from insurer Phoenix Group, the Marks &amp;amp; Spencer deal and the 10-year contract with the Teacher’s Pension Scheme in England and Wales, amidst a challenging macro environment in the region.  Nest and TCS have worked closely since 2011 when the digital, auto-enrolment pension scheme was first launched. Nest currently has more than 12 million members and by the end of the next decade it expects to have around £100bn assets under management.  &quot;While the exact costs are commercially sensitive, we can confirm that under our current estimates, the total contract cost falls within the total estimated contract value of £1.5bn, as published in the Contract Award Notice. It’s important to note this amount is the estimated total maximum value for the maximum duration of the contract, including extensions,&quot; the Nest spokesperson added.  As a part of this extended partnership, TCS will deploy solutions from TCS BaNCS to deliver personalized, self-directed experiences to members. “This will enable Nest’s 12 million members and 1 million employers to access the right information at the right time, in the way that suits them best,” the company said.  Gavin Perera-Betts, Chief Customer Officer, Nest in a statement said, “We have a strong foundation after many years of working together and they’ve proven their ability to deliver successfully for a scheme the size and complexity of Nest. This puts us in an excellent position to further advance our operations and build a truly digital offering that delivers a superior customer experience long into the future.”  Vivekanand Ramgopal, President of BFSI Products &amp;amp; Platforms, TCS added, “We are delighted to further expand this long-standing partnership with Nest and support them in pushing the boundaries in offering compelling omnichannel member experiences to the new generation of workers entering the workplace.

TCS,2023-06-07T08:12:30+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"Former TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan earned Rs 29.16 cr in FY23, up by over 13% YoY","The new CEO K Krithivasan will earn a basic salary of Rs 10 lakh each month, but the biggest part of his salary will be the commission that is payable to him based on company performance. ","Former Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan drew Rs 29.16 crore in remuneration in FY23, an over 13.17 percent YoY increase from Rs 25.75 crore he received in FY22, according to the Mumbai-headquartered IT services company’s annual report.  Gopinathan’s compensation included his basic salary; benefits, perquisites and allowances; and commission. He received a commission of Rs 25 crore in FY23. The compensation does not include employee stock purchase scheme (ESPS). He holds around 2,760 stocks in the company.  K Krithivasan took over the top job from Gopinathan from June 1, 2023 onwards, although his compensation package was not disclosed. He will be paid a basic salary of Rs 10 lakh per month, which can go up to a maximum of Rs 16 lakh per month. Krithivasan, as of FY23, holds around 11,232 company shares. However, like in the case of Gopinathan, the commission is subject to the company’s performance and will make up a bulk of his remuneration.  The company said that the commission is calculated with reference to the net profit earned, subject to the ceilings set. The specific amount to be paid out to the executive, however, will be up to the Board or the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and paid out annually.  Gopinathan made over 427 times the median remuneration of the company’s employees. According to the report, TCS employees in FY23 saw a median remuneration increase of 5.11 percent. When calculated, TCS' median employee pay for FY23 stood at Rs. 6.82 lakh per annum. The company has around 6,14,795 permanent employees.    Chief Operating Officer NG Subramaniam earned Rs 23.6 crore in FY23, of which Rs 19.5 crore was the commission, and the rest being his salary and benefits. He saw a 14.08 percent increase in remuneration, and made 345.68 times the median remuneration. He holds 1,97,760 shares in the company.  There is a wide disparity between the salaries of CEOs in TCS’ peers such as Infosys and Wipro. For the year in question, Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte drew a salary of Rs 82.4 crore in FY23 ($10 million), which was a fall of 5 percent from the preceding year.  Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, on the other hand, earned Rs 56.44 crore in FY23, which was a fall from Rs 71 crore in FY22. However, the fall was primarily on account of exercising restricted stock units (RSUs) during the year. Parekh made 627 times the median remuneration, as compared to Gopinathan’s 427.  Focus on ‘AI transition’  In his letter to the shareholders, Chairman N Chandrasekaran highlighted that amid rapid evolution of digital technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) transition has become the company’s “central focus.”  “The impact of AI and Machine learning is going to be profound. There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI. Majority of the businesses are still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT. There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors,” he said.  “Leveraging generative AI would further require technology innovation and investments,” he added.  The company will also focus on building talent for the future. The energy, supply chain, and AI transitions will require companies to reskill/upskill existing talent base, hire and integrate new talent, and invest in research, according to Chandrasekaran. “Our technology strengths make us well-placed to respond to the global demand and scale up our talent base,” he said.  He also noted the ongoing energy transition as sustainable growth takes centre stage for businesses; and a supply chain transition resulting from geo-political situation is underway as companies rebalance their supply chains for resilience and efficiency.  Meanwhile, Krithivasan in his letter said, “As part of their continuing digital transformation journey, we see sustained focus on cloud adoption, data architecture, customer experience and business model transformation.”  “On top of these current focus areas, technologies like 5G, IoT, generative AI, virtual reality / metaverse, digital twin and others are also gaining attention and are likely to attract investments in the short to medium term,” he added.  Gopinathan’s last letter  Gopinathan’s last letter to the company’s shareholders as the TCS CEO and MD mentioned that having full services capability as a company has helped TCS’ enable clients to thrive in good times and bad.  “During the up-cycle, we help clients accelerate and expand their technology-led innovation to differentiate themselves and drive growth. On the down cycle, we help them adapt, using technology to drive the efficiency, agility and resilience needed to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for better times ahead,” he said.  Gopinathan termed his tenure as an “absolute privilege and unparalleled learning experience”, and said that he is confidence the company’s best years are ahead of it as enterprises rely on technology ever more.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/former-tcs-ceo-rajesh-gopinathan-earned-rs-29-16-cr-in-fy23-427-times-median-remuneration-10754931.html

This will be the IT services major’s third large deal from the region following the $723-million deal from insurer Phoenix Group and the Marks &amp;amp; Spencer deal in 2023, despite macro-economic uncertainties.  The Teachers’ Pension Scheme is the second largest public sector pension scheme in the UK with over 2 million members. The size of the deal was not disclosed by the company, but according to sources, it's a large deal.  Through this contract, TCS will manage the scheme’s administration services using its digitally enabled, omnichannel platform powered by TCS BaNCS. TCS has been tasked with providing digital-first, self-service pension experience, “giving scheme employers and members any-time, any-channel access to their account information, along with personalized insights to help them understand their pension plan better and empower them to make informed decisions.”  As part of the partnership with DfE, TCS also plans to expand its already significant presence in the UK life and pensions industry by establishing a service hub in Darlington. TCS is the largest provider of software and IT services in the UK, and has a workforce spanning 30 locations around the country.

TCS,2023-06-01T11:11:04+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"TCS CEO Krithivasan lays out vision for future with focus on AI, cloud, cybersecurity","In the internal note seen by Moneycontrol, Krithivasan reminisced about his early days, calling it a period of &quot;continuous learning&quot;","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) CEO K Krithivasan struck a nostalgic and positive note in his first email to employees, after officially taking charge of India's largest IT services on June 1.  In the internal note seen by Moneycontrol, Krithivasan reminisced about his early days, calling it a period of &quot;continuous learning&quot; since he joined the company in 1989.  &quot;I have had great opportunities to understand and appreciate our core values through various leadership roles across delivery, sales, client management and business management. During this time, I have had the opportunity to work with many of you and built long-lasting friendships, which I cherish the most,&quot; he said.  Krithivasan is a TCS lifer, having been with the company for 33 years. Prior to his elevation, he was the global head of the company’s BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) vertical, which accounts for 35-40 percent of the company's revenue.  According to a recent Kotak note, Krithivasan was responsible for a portfolio of $11 billion in the BFSI vertical.  Focus on AI, Cloud  As Krithivasan takes over to steer the company into its next phase, he said that TCS will continue to investment in key and emerging areas like &quot;Cloud, Cyber Security, 5G, IoT, Generative Al, etc, with an unrelenting focus on customer relationships and impeccable delivery.&quot;  During its Q4FY23 earnings conference, Chief Operating Officer NG Subramaniam had said that client conversations in the previous quarter would start and stop with ChatGPT. Soon after, TCS launched its own TCS Generative AI offering and collaborated to Google Cloud to build industry-specific solutions.  In January this year, during an interview with Moneycontrol, Krithivasan's predecessor Rajesh Gopinathan had said that despite clients looking to cut down cloud costs and rethinking technology spending, TCS is uniquely positioned when it comes to moving to the next phase of digital transformation. The company has seen over two years of demand spike and cloud migration.  From both cost optimisation and phase two of transformation deals perspective, TCS is positioned to benefit in terms of deal wins.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-ceo-krithivasan-lays-out-vision-for-future-with-focus-on-ai-cloud-cybersecurity-10720881.html
TCS,2023-06-01T10:00:24+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"Affable, execution-focussed, empathetic: Meet K Krithivasan, who takes charge of TCS today","As he settles into his new role at the corner office, the new TCS chief executive will have to focus on ensuring growth in key markets such as the US and Europe, and striking the right balance between growth-focused large deal wins and small/ mid-sized deals, say analysts. ","When N Chandrasekaran (59) and K Krithivasan (58) studied at Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore Institute of Technology (CIT) in the early 1980s, little did they know that their futures would unfold in remarkably similar ways.  On March 16, CIT added another feather to its cap when K Krithivasan was named CEO and MD-designate of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services firm.  This marks the second instance of a CIT graduate leading TCS, with the first being none other than Chandrasekaran. The former CEO is now the chairman of the company’s parent, Tata Sons.  However, Chandra and Krithi, as they are called, have more in common than an alma mater. They both have a lifelong association with TCS and the Tata group, share a passion for running, and are willing to live out of a suitcase if it leads to better chances of client closures and deal wins.  “Krithi has already started to travel like crazy. He was in the US, EU, and London twice. He is very similar to Chandra (N Chandrasekaran, the chairman of Tata Sons). He will go as many times as a client asks him to for a deal,” an industry analyst said.  A senior official at TCS concurred with this assessment. “That is an accurate description. He is very customer oriented. Internally, he is popular and gets along very well with other leaders.”  An alumnus of CIT and IIT Kanpur, Krithivasan takes over the TCS reins on June 1 as the fifth CEO in its over-five-decade-long history. While Krithi was based in Chennai, he has been operating out of the TCS guest house in Mumbai for the last few months and will start house hunting soon as his family will be relocating. An avid reader, he has also been taking an intensive Sanskrit course over the last few years.  At 58, he will be one of the seniormost executives in the company to be appointed CEO. Prior to this, he was the global head of TCS’s Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) Business Group, which contributes around 35 percent of the company’s revenue.  Krithi takes charge at a time when growth is slowing down for the IT sector due to uncertainties, and caution in key markets such as the US and Europe.  In his tenure at TCS spanning over 33 years, Krithivasan has maintained a low profile, but those who have known him describe him as a hard-working, execution-driven leader, who is also approachable and cordial. According to a recent note by Kotak Institutional Equities, he managed a large BFSI portfolio of $11 billion.  Ronak Doshi, partner at Everest Group, who has interacted with Krithi over the last five years, said he is respected by clients and focused on outcomes.  “He has a lot of credibility among the analyst and investor community as a client-facing P&amp;amp;L owner. He is highly accessible to clients and has empowered his leadership team to act in the best interest of the client,” Doshi told Moneycontrol.  Driven, focused and smart — that’s how Phil Fersht, CEO of HFS Research, an outsourcing research firm, describes Krithivasan, with whom he has been acquainted over the years. “He seems smart, articulate, and really knows the business. He also has a warm, empathetic manner to motivate key people to deliver for the firm,” Fersht said.  When Chandrasekaran moved to Tata Sons, Krithivasan was one of the frontrunners to replace him, before outgoing CEO Rajesh Gopinathan was picked for the top job in 2017. While most disappointed frontrunners tend to quit, Krithi stayed back and continued to perform.  His growth trajectory at TCS has many parallels with that of Chandra. He learnt the company’s business and operations ground-up, having worked in delivery, pre-sales, sales and large client groups.  As he settles into his new role at the corner office, the focus will be on ensuring growth in key markets such as the US and Europe, and striking the right balance between growth-focused large deal wins and small/ mid-sized deals, analysts said.    What to expect?  TCS began calendar year 2023 on a good note. It has already bagged three mega deals of over $700 million. These include a $723-million deal from UK-based insurer Phoenix Group and another one with British retailer Marks and Spencer (M&amp;amp;S). Though the exact deal size was not disclosed, the M&amp;amp;S deal was worth $1 billion, according to reports.  Most recently, a consortium led by TCS received an advance purchase order for a $1.8-billion-plus deal from government-owned telco Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to deploy its 4G network across India.  Beyond deal win prospects, travelling and meeting clients in person to understand market and demand cycles will top Krithi’s agenda as he takes charge. He will also be looking at building a better connect with TCS’ employees. Krithivasan is already regarded as an empathetic leader and consensus builder within the company.  TCS’ cautious approach  Perhaps the biggest news about TCS in 2022 was its business restructuring plan and what it really meant. The company had unveiled four distinctive business groups based on the client’s journey with the company, instead of verticals based on business sectors and geographies.  These groups were the acquisition group, relationship incubation group, enterprise group and finally business transformation group. Apparently, not many within the company liked this model. In a previous report, Moneycontrol had reported that Krithivasan himself was not happy with the reorganisation plan and decided to keep his vertical out of it. Also, TCS is yet to start reporting group-wise revenue and growth numbers.  Analysts Moneycontrol spoke to are now waiting to hear an update on the same. “This rejig has caused considerable unrest among senior executives and vertical heads. The new CEO needs to take a call on whether to continue with the restructuring or roll back the proposed changes,” Everest’s Doshi said.  For FY24, in terms of business, TCS has already alluded to the mix of deals in its bookings being more near-term, quick ROI-based small-to-medium term deals (aligned with the cost agenda of clients), implying a faster degree of revenue conversion in the future.    Gopinathan’s farewell  On May 30, Gopinathan, whose exit stunned the industry, sent out a heartfelt internal note to employees as his last day as the CEO neared. Gopinathan expressed gratitude, and also highlighted some interesting milestones from his six-year-long tenure.  TCS’ revenues grew from $17.5 billion in March 2017 to $27.9 billion in March 2023, he wrote. During this period, the company’s market capitalisation grew from $74 billion to $143 billion, and it returned over Rs 2 trillion ($27.3 billion) to shareholders through dividend and share buybacks.  Gopinathan, also a TCS lifer, expressed gratitude to his predecessors FC Kohli, S Ramadorai and N Chandrasekharan.

Gopinathan looked back on his time at the company, saying that this week marks the culmination of his two-decade-long journey with TCS. “I will step down from my role as CEO &amp;amp; MD on 31 May, 2023.

Gopinathan stressed on the company’s focus on Agile, Automation and cloud, terming the company capitalising on the cloud opportunity as helping it emerge as top global partner of all three leading cloud providers. “Combining this with increasing investments and focus on our field sales teams helped us expand our customer base across markets and increase the number of customers, contributing more than $100 million in annual revenue from 35 to 60,” he said.  TCS lifer Gopinathan will stay on till September to smooth over the transition for his successor, K Krithivasan, who takes over the mantle of CEO on June 1.   Gopinathan's abrupt exit took all stakeholders by surprise, considering the storied IT firm has had just 4 CEOs in its 55-year history — FC Kohli, S Ramadorai, N Chandrasekharan, and then Gopinathan. It also comes at a particularly fraught time for the IT industry at large, which is facing a slowdown amid increasing headwinds.  &quot;I am grateful to have had the privilege to helm the TCS journey for the last six years, and carry on the proud legacy of Mr Kohli, Ram and Chandra.

TCS,2023-05-08T13:03:23+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra, Analyst call tracker | IT stocks cement position in ‘Maximum Pessimism’ list after weak Q4 show; Adani...,"While analysts are bearish on two-wheeler firms on rural uncertainty, they remain most optimistic on financial companies’ stocks","Large-cap IT companies have been languishing in analysts’ pessimism list since 2022. A year later, the picture remains unchanged.  What started with two names has grown to four – Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech. The Street wasn’t expecting any fireworks from large-cap IT companies but the Q4 numbers were rather underwhelming. After the poor show, the stocks have cemented their positions further in the list.  Data available with Bloomberg showed that these four IT names have higher Sell and Hold calls than Buys. Though Infosys does not feature among the top 10 names in the Maximum Pessimism list, it too has seen a fair number of downgrades after forecasting the slowest revenue growth rate in six years of 4-7 percent.  Also Read: TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech record 65% decline in hiring as IT sector runs into a rough patch  “Worsening outlook of top clients of IT services companies point to further pressures for Indian IT firms. This has started to reflect in the revenue growth figures of IT firms in Q4 FY23, slightly ahead of the imminent US recession,” according to analysts at Jefferies.  Weakness in communications and BFSI verticals and higher scrutiny on discretionary IT spends are the key reasons keeping investors as well as mutual fund managers away from the sector.  Two-wheeler firms slide  Apart from the IT sector, two names from the auto segment – Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto – have also made it to the ‘Maximum Pessimism’ list. Slow recovery in rural demand for two-wheelers, declining exports, particularly Nigeria nightmare for Bajaj Auto, and inconsistent trend in bottom line have kept analysts on the edge.  As of April end, Hero MotoCorp had 12 Hold calls, 9 Sell calls and 26 Buy calls. Bajaj Auto had 17 Hold calls, 4 Sell calls and 27 Buy calls. Despite Hero MotoCorp beating Street estimates with Q4 results last week, no significant upgrades have trickled in for the stock. Only a turnaround in rural demand led by a good rabi harvest season, cooling of inflationary pressures in export markets and an EV strategy can change analysts’ minds.  Meanwhile, in absolute terms, JSW Steel and Divi’s Laboratories remained the top two names in the Maximum Pessimism list due to high valuations, with 17 and 10 Sell calls respectively.  Optimism list  A short seller’s scathing report released earlier this year has had no effect on analysts’ optimism for Adani Ports. With 20 Buy calls and nil Hold or Sell calls, the stock boasts of an optimism score of 100.  Also Read: CLSA has 'buy' rating on Adani Ports, raises target price to Rs 790  In April, Adani Ports announced the acquisition of Karaikal Port Private Limited for Rs 1,485 crore under India’s bankruptcy law. With the takeover, its portfolio has now grown to 14 ports in India. The company has also adjusted its ambitious capital expenditure plans till FY25 to conserve cash, which is being liked by analysts.  Goldman Sachs recently reaffirmed its Buy rating on Adani Ports, with a target price of Rs 810. CLSA, too, has given a Buy rating and raised the target price to Rs 790 from Rs 700. Similarly, Morgan Stanley has an Overweight stance on the company's stock and has set a target price of Rs 690.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  Financial firms stay put  Like the script remains unchanged for IT stocks, so is the case for financials. Out of the 10 stocks that analysts were most optimistic about in April, 5 came from the financial space. This has been the case since November last year. State Bank of India, SBI Life Insurance Co, ICICI Bank, Housing Development Finance Corp and HDFC Bank to continue enjoy optimism scores ranging from 96 to 100.  Profits of the 26 Nifty companies that have declared Q4 results so far have risen 10 percent year on year, fuelled by financials. Excluding financials, profits would have declined 1 percent year on year, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.  Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries see most upgrades in April, Infosys most downgraded  With faster repricing of deposits, there was a fear of banks’ net interest margins contracting but all big private banks have managed to expand their margins in Q4 as well. Along with that, sustained momentum in disbursements and stable asset quality continue to be the tailwinds for the BFSI firms, analysts said.  On May 5, HDFC and HDFC Bank took a sharp knock after Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) said the merged entity’s weighting will go down in the index. While it could lead to outflows of $150-200 million, analysts believe it is just a technical overhang while the fundamentals remain intact.

TCS,2023-04-17T06:49:32+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Expect attrition to drop close to 12-13 percent by H2FY24 : TCS CHRO Milind Lakkad,"TCS plans to hire around 40,000 freshers in FY23-24, and another 5,000-8,000 employees across its global offices. ","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) expects to bring down its attrition rate close to its pre-pandemic range of 12-13 percent by the second half of the fiscal year 2023-24, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) Milind Lakkad said. The IT services behemoth has started to slow down hiring and focus on improving employee utilisation rates.  The attrition rate of the January-December quarter stood at 20.1 percent on a last twelve-month (LTM) basis. This is an improvement from the previous (Q3) attrition rate of 21.3 percent. TCS has also reduced hiring, adding only around 821 new employees in Q4FY22-23, compared to 35,209 employees in Q4 of FY21-22.  Speaking to Moneycontrol, Lakkad said, “We want to go down to our original levels. So 12-13 percent is the band which we are comfortable with… I know my numbers will really come back close to this range. We expect to reach pre-pandemic number levels in the second half of this year.” TCS rolled out 46,000 offers to freshers in FY22-23, and plans to hire around 40,000 freshers in FY23-24.  Besides these 40,000 freshers, Lakkad said the company will also hire between 5,000-8,000 employees across its offices in Latin America (LATAM), Asia-Pacific (APAC), United Kingdom (UK), Europe, and north America. The north America, UK, APAC, and LATAM offices also hire a significant number of trainees.  “40,000 is the number of trainees hired primarily from India. Apart from that, we do hire a significant number in LATAM and APAC. In Europe, not a very big number yet, but yeah, we do hire in Europe, North America,” he said.  Lakkad added that in Europe the company had started with a few countries and will expand its presence further.  Skills expected to be in demand this year include analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) in roles across industries such as banking, retail, manufacturing, pharma, etc., Lakkad said.  Return to office  In September 2022, TCS had mandated that employees would have to work from the office three days a week. TCS COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam, in an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol in January, had said that 2.1 lakh of the company’s 6.13 lakh employees, roughly a third of their workforce, had started working from office at least thrice a week.  Lakkad updated that as of now, nearly 53 percent of its employees across campuses are working from office twice a week, and about 43 percent thrice a week.  “There are multiple challenges. People have moved to their hometowns, and some of them have kids who joined schools in that area. So they are taking time. Others have some other genuine challenges. We're working through all of that. It’'s taking longer than what I initially thought it would. But it’s moving in the right direction. I want it to move faster,” Lakkad said, explaining why they still don’t have everyone coming to office every day.  TCS had announced its 25/25 vision earlier, wherein by 2025 only 25 percent of the employees were to work out of TCS facilities at any time. Lakkad said that while that plan was still on, his priority was to first get all employees to come to work thrice a week.  “And then we will see how it’s going, what the work model is, what the people and industries are thinking,” he said.  He added, “We have been working 100 percent remotely, during which time we have actually delivered to our customers reasonably well. But we still believe we should not lose that connection with the people. Just talking to them only in the context of work and nothing else is not a good thing.”  Generative AI to aid employees  During its earnings call on April 12, TCS had said that all its clients are actively looking for the integration of generative AI and ChatGPT into the offerings of the IT services firm.  &quot;In my interactions with clients over the last quarter, the conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT. Everybody talks about ChatGPT and what it's going to do. That’s the theme in all the deal wins we have, and a huge amount of focus on cloud data. Machine learning is also a very, very important area of focus,” Subramaniam had said during the earnings call.  Now it turns out that not just for its customers, TCS is exploring generative AI solutions even for its own employees, to enable them to be more productive.  Around two quarters back TCS had started to work on an internal gig platform to let its employees have the opportunities to learn quickly, explore, and work on different technologies, environments, customers, and industries beyond their regular jobs.  But the gig platform will now require some reconsideration and tweaks as generative AI and AI co-workers can do the same work without involving the core teams, Lakkad said.  “These things are evolving as we speak. With new technologies coming in, our own thinking is also evolving. We are looking into what generative AI means in the context of an enterprise, not just from the standpoint of what the operating model will be, but also what will be the role of an employee versus the role of an AI co-worker,” Lakkad said.  Lakkad added that with generative AI being used, there are also discussions underway about safeguarding intellectual property (IP), security, etc.  Rival Infosys too has been talking about betting big on generative AI and ChatGPT as demand from clients and active projects around the technology continue to grow.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/expect-attrition-to-drop-close-to-12-13-percent-by-h2fy24-tcs-chro-milind-lakkad-10422431.html

TCS,2023-04-13T08:28:34+05:30,Moneycontrol News,TCS Q4 profit up 14.8% YoY. What should investors do with stock?,"TCS Q4 result | The company's consolidated revenue from operations came in at Rs 59,162 crore, up 16.9 percent, from Rs 50,591 crore in the year-ago quarter. Brokerages have a mixed view on on weaker-than-expected quarter for India's largest IT services company ","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will be in focus on April 13, a day after India’s biggest IT services company reported a 14.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 11,392 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.  The company reported a profit of Rs 10,846 crore in the December 2022 quarter.  Consolidated revenue from operations came in at Rs 59,162 crore, up 16.9 percent, from Rs 50,591 crore in the year-ago quarter. It stood at Rs 58,229 crore in the December quarter of FY23.  Analysts had estimated the Tata Group company to report 2.1 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth in revenue, while net profit was projected to increase 6.2 percent QoQ in the January-March quarter.  In constant currency (cc) terms, the revenue rose 10.7 percent year-on-year (YoY), the company said.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company after March quarter earnings:  JPMorgan  JPMorgan has maintained “underweight” rating on the stock with the target price of 2,700 a share. TCS's Q4 results missed due to unexpected weakness in the US and continued challenges in Europe, it said. The outlook for TCS has been clouded by client caution driving cuts to discretionary tech spends.  While headline signings are healthy, delayed/deferred discretionary projects will delay billing. The uncertain macro and tech spends should drive a softer H1FY24, pulling down FY24 growth.  JPMorgan has cut its revenue estimate by a percent and margin by 20 basis poins (bps), driving 2 percent EPS cuts.  One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  Citi  Foreign broking house Citi has kept “sell” rating with a target price of 3,000 a share. The brokerage said TCS's Q4 results were weaker than expected and valuations are still high.  Firstly, TCS's FY23 TTM TCV (total contract value) is flattish YoY compared to over 10 percent YoY growth in FY22, which is a forward-looking indicator.  Secondly, the headcount for FY23 is expected to be over 4 percent YoY versus 21 percent YoY growth in FY22. Finally, the management commentary has turned incrementally cautious, which is also a forward-looking indicator.  With regular wage hikes, margin estimates may need to be revised down, it said.  Bernstein  Bernstein has given TCS an “outperform” rating with a target price of 3,560 a share. The firm said TCS had a soft quarter amid macro headwinds but the order book remained healthy. Additionally, the book-to-bill ratio improved to 1.39x compared from 1.1x.  However, TCS's management indicated that the near-term outlook is uncertain in North America and BFSI (banking, financial services, and insurance). Clients are reportedly reducing discretionary spends and non-critical deals, and focusing on cost optimisation.  CLSA  CLSA also kept “outperform” rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 3,550. TCS had a weak Q4 print but the healthy order book is reassuring for the mid-term outlook, it said.  Near-term uncertainties and non-committal management commentary may weigh on the stock. The firm expects TCS's structural strengths and 4 percent dividend yield to lend support.  Jefferies  Jefferies has given TCS a “hold” rating with a target price of Rs 3,375 per share TCS's Q4FY23 results missed estimates and there is rising caution among clients across several verticals in Europe and North America. The book-to-bill ratio is at a three-year low and headcount additions are subdued, which point to a slowdown.  Jefferies has cut its estimates for TCS by 2-3 percent but expects the company to deliver 6.7 percent CAGR in constant currency revenue and 10 percent EPS CAGR. TCS's premium valuations, however, are limiting the upside, it said.  Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley is “equal weight” on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,350. The weak macro backdrop has impacted TCS's Q4 results, and there is limited clarity on whether sentiment has troughed despite a strong order book.  Lower attrition-led margin tailwinds would be offset by weak operating leverage. The valuation of TCS is higher than its long-term average and the brokerage does not find the risk-reward attractive at this time.  Morgan Stanley has lowered its FY24/25 EPS estimates by up to 1 percent.  Nomura  Nomura has a “reduce” rating on TCS and has cut the target price to Rs 2,850. The Q4 result disappoints, both on revenue and margin front. The near-term visibility, too, is low for the company. The weak headcount additions continue on lower discretionary revenues.  TCS missed its Q4FY23 margin exit guidance, which is attributed to lower discretionary revenues. Nomura has cut its earnings estimates for FY24-25 by 1-2 percent.

TCS,2023-04-12T22:57:13+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS’ year-on-year constant currency revenue growth moderates to 13.7%, The IT services behemoth sees slowdown in revenue growth and operating margins amidst worsening macro environment and client sentiments.,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported moderation in year-on-year (YoY) revenue growth in constant currency (CC) terms. Full-year revenue growth for FY23 in CC terms came in at 13.7 percent YoY down from a 15.4 percent growth YoY in FY22, as certain key markets such as North America continue to remain weak and challenging.  Constant currency refers to a fixed exchange rate that eliminates fluctuations when calculating financial performance figures. For IT services companies, which have operations in other countries represent their  their earnings in CC terms since floating exchange rates can often mask true performance.  In INR terms, however, TCS' full-year revenue for FY23 stood at Rs 225,458 crore against Rs 191,754 crore in FY22.  EBIT margins contracted 0.5 percent YoY at 24.5 percent for the quarter. On a sequential basis, it remained flat.  TCS CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan remained cautious of the environment, adding that the demand scenario varies depending on the markets too.  “At the start of the year, we expected North America to recover well, that has not happened. Other markets have grown as expected. The UK has been strong and we are increasing growth in Europe,” he said addressing the media.  Gopinathan added, “Expect near-term weakness in North America on the back of BFSI. Near-term needs to be watched. Demand for tech-led transformation and optimisation continues to be strong but requires a very nuanced approach by market and vertical.”  TCS has the highest exposure to the BFSI sector among its Tier-I peers with around 35-40 percent of its revenue coming from this vertical. The global banking crisis that erupted over the past couple of months with the collapse of the regional US banks including Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Swiss bank Credit Suisse to name a few, led to customer sentiments worsening.  Samir Seksaria, CFO of TCS said, “What we saw at the beginning of the year and how macro environment and client sentiments turned increasingly negative getting into February and March is something that reflected into both revenue and cost sides. With discretionary spend getting impacted, the revenue also gets impacted.”  He added that though going by the order book customers are opting for cost take out and larger transformations, TCS is seeing current projects being deferred.  On achieving TCS’ operating margin target band of 26-28 percent, Seksaria said, “A 26-28 percent operating margin is our guiding beacon. The management teams across units believe our long-term cost structures help us deliver and maintain that margin band. But due to the current uncertainties, it’s difficult to predict when we will reach there.&quot;  CEO designate K Krithivasan, who heads the company’s BFSI vertical, said that sentiments were down in the BFSI sector adding that people rushed to save costs.  “People rushed to save costs. It's more sentiments at play than anything structural. Large bank clients are benefitting from increasing deposits in North America. Some issues in the US, other markets are doing quite well for us,” Krithivasan said.  Not just TCS, which doesn’t give revenue growth guidance anyway, rivals like Cognizant too had cut its full-year revenue guidance.  In November, the company cut its revenue growth guidance in constant currency terms for the full year from 8.5-9.5 percent to 7 percent. It was revised downwards in the quarter before that as well.  Meanwhile, Infosys which is set to announce its numbers on April 13, had increased its full-year revenue growth guidance in January on the back of expected large deals.  Infosys revised its full-year FY23 revenue growth guidance to 16-16.5 percent from 15-16 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-year-on-year-constant-currency-revenue-growth-drops-to-13-7-10404361.html

He explained that the current structure was put in place after a lot of internal deliberations and that any tweaks required would be made after meeting with customers and associates.  The company's current structure, which was unveiled last April under outgoing CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, divided clients into four different business groups based on the stage of their journey with the company, rather than verticals. Gopinathan and Krithivasan will be meeting with clients over the next six to eight weeks.  Sources previously told Moneycontrol that not all senior leadership members were satisfied with TCS' restructuring. K Krithivasan, who was previously the global head for the BFSI vertical and will become the new CEO, reportedly kept his department out of the restructuring.  Prior to his promotion, Krithivasan was responsible for the largest vertical of TCS, which generates 35-40% of the company's revenue. In his new role, he will focus on becoming familiar with the non-BFSI side of the business.  Krithivasan had previously stated that he did not plan on making any immediate organizational or structural changes to the company.  “We (Rajesh Gopinathan and Krithivasan) have enjoyed every moment in this organization. It's a continuum. It's not that as every CEO changes, we come up with a new strategy or new set of priorities. We have a core set of beliefs and values. We're focusing on employees, focusing on our customers is the most important engine that drives our growth. We always try to be close to our customers,” he had said.  TCS' outgoing CEO, Rajesh Gopinathan, will continue to assist with the transition until September 15, while K Krithivasan takes over on June 1.  Gopinathan explained that during the first half of the transition period, he will be primary and Krithivasan will be shadow, and vice versa in the second half.  He emphasised that the transition will be done diligently, although he doesn't expect it to be overly complicated.  Gopinathan and Krithivasan have planned to travel over the next six to eight weeks to meet with customers and field teams, after which they will execute on their plans.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/incoming-tcs-ceo-k-krithivasan-plans-no-rush-to-change-structure-10404091.html
TCS,2023-04-12T21:10:56+05:30,Haripriya Suresh," 'In my interactions with clients over last quarter, conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT’: TCS COO...",Subramaniam said TCS will have a centre of excellence around generative AI,"The macroeconomic climate has led to Tata Consultancy Services taking a pessimistic tone, but clients of the company are captivated with generative AI, says the company’s Chief Operating Officer NG Subramaniam. According to him, clients are questioning how they are integrating software like ChatGPT into their offerings, or if they have plans to do so.  &quot;In my interactions with all these clients over the last quarter, the conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT. Everybody talks about ChatGPT and what it's going to do. It’s very clear that innovation is surpassing productivity. That kind of theme is what is spanning out in all these deal wins that we have, it's a huge amount of focus on cloud data. At the same time, you know, machine learning is a very, very important area of focus for people,” he said while addressing journalists after the company announced its results for Q4FY23.  For now, the focus of TCS will be on how they apply aspects like machine learning and deep learning to the data and “raise the bar” for their delivery capabilities.  The company is also running pilots, and plans to have a centre of excellence around the technology.  “ChatGPT kind of a technology is like any other tool, any other technology. As it matures, I think we will be ready for it. We will have a centre of excellence around it, we will have core competencies built around it and then see what are the drawbacks on it. What are the pros for it, and then use it the right way to deliver responsibly and meaningfully to our clients,” he said.  He added that while it may be too early to say how it will pan out in the future, he believed that with generative AI, “every small area that was not touched upon by technology, I think it has the potential to be touched”.  You're going to see technology everywhere and it will only accelerate the adoption of some of the borderline technology or frontier areas of technology, he added.  Speaking to analysts, he said that generative AI has the potential to live up to the expectation.  “Many quarters ago, I mentioned that AI/ML has the potential to fundamentally change the way that we deliver software to our clients and a significant part of what we are doing today can get automated, can get generated…I think we are quite excited about the opportunity of delivering proven code. Whether you can call it a low code, no code, zero-code, or a generative AI kind of software, the result is a software that generates software. I think we’ve built such an expertise around that capability, around the toolset and stay relevant to our clients' expectations,” he said.  However, there has been one looming question ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene and generative AI became a part of everyday lexicon: will it replace people and take away jobs?  Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said this is something they’ve seen for many years — that whenever a new technology comes in, jobs don’t reduce, they change. “We’ll have to add on skills to what they learn and based on that new value will be created for the customer,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/in-my-interactions-with-clients-over-last-quarter-conversation-starts-and-stops-with-chatgpt-tcs-coo-ng-subramaniam-10404011.html

Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said that over 6,00,000 people had appeared for the company’s national qualifier test, and 46,000 offers have already been rolled out.  In FY23, the company has onboarded over 44,000 freshers, beating its target of 40,000 for the year.  The company onboarded roughly 2,000 freshers during the last quarter of the fiscal. It onboarded 15,000 freshers during Q2, 20,000 in Q2, and roughly 7,000 freshers in Q3FY23.  It hired over 1 lakh freshers in FY22.  “We are honouring all job offers, and have added 22,600 employees on a net basis in FY 23. During the year, we onboarded over 44K freshers and our highest-ever number of experienced professionals,” Lakkad said in a statement.  Speaking to the press, Lakkad said that the company honoured all its offers, and will continue to do so.  “There were some delays -- a month or two -- for onboarding people, but it will happen. We honoured all the offers. In future, no reduction in salaries, nothing. Whatever we are committed is what we offer,” he said.  The offer rollout comes at a time when the company’s net headcount addition has slowed significantly, adding just 821 employees on a net basis in Q4FY23.  The company added 22,600 employees in FY23 on a net basis, a steep decline from last fiscal’s 1.03 lakh.

TCS,2023-04-12T18:48:35+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS’ Rajesh Gopinathan says quarter weaker than expected; Q4FY23 TCV at $10 billion,"Incoming CEO K Krithivasan, who heads the company’s BFSI vertical, said that sentiments were down in the sector as people rushed to save costs. ","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported a strong order book of $10 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Despite a tough business environment due to macroeconomic headwinds, the IT services giant saw its all-time high number of large deals signed in a quarter.  However, the total contract value (TCV) for Q4 was down by 11.5 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis as compared to $11.3 billion reported in Q4FY22. Full-year TCV for FY23 stood at $34.1 billion, down from $34.6 billion in FY22.  Some of the deal wins in Q4 include UK insurer Phoenix Group’s $723 million deal, Telefonica Germany, KeySight, Bitcoin Suisse AG, Bombardier, CTBC Bank, Taiwan, etc to name a few.  According to analysts, TCS is one of the key beneficiaries as clients focus on cost-takeout deals and look at vendor consolidation.  Rajesh Gopinathan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, TCS said: “It is very satisfying to look back at our strong growth in FY2023, on top of the mid-teen growth in the prior year. The strength of our order book demonstrates the resilience of demand for our services and gives us visibility for growth in the medium term.”  “Demand scenario is varying by market. At the start of the year, we expected North America to recover well, but that has not happened. Other markets have grown as expected. The UK has been strong, increasing positive growth in Europe,” Gopinath told the media.  He said that this quarter has come in weaker than expected, primarily due to North America. The company saw volatility in the banking system and said it was difficult to call out how long this will last.  “Near term needs to be watched. Demand for tech-led transformation and optimisation continues to be strong but requires a very nuanced approach by market and vertical,” Gopinath said.  The January-March quarter was marked by the global banking crisis with the collapse of several US-based regional banks, including the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank and Swiss bank Credit Suisse – adding to the IT sector’s woes as it is already struggling with macro-economic challenges. As of Q3, TCS got around 38.5 percent of its revenue from the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) vertical, the highest BFSI exposure among Tier-I Indian IT firms.  Incoming CEO K Krithivasan, who heads the company’s BFSI vertical, said that sentiments were down in the sector as people rushed to save costs.  “People rushed to save costs. It's more sentiments at play than anything structural. Large bank clients are benefitting from increasing deposits in North America. Some issues in US, other markets are doing quite well for us,” Krithivasan said.  In Q4, the company had 60 clients in the $100 Mn+ band, 133 in the $50 Mn+ band, 291 in the $20 Mn+ band, 461 in the $10 Mn+ band and 1241 in the $1 Mn+ band.  On a year-on-year basis in constant currency terms, growth in Q4 was led by Retail and CPG (13 percent) and Life Sciences and Healthcare (12.3 percent), followed by Technology &amp;amp; Services grew 9.2 percent, BFSI grew 9.1 percent, Manufacturing grew 9.1 percent and Communications &amp;amp; Media grew 5.3 percent.  The TCV for Q4 stood at $10 billion, higher than its guidance of $7-9 billion. TCV was up 28.1 percent from $7.8 billion in Q3. On a YoY basis, the number was lower than $11.3 billion TCV clocked in Q4FY22, its highest-ever quarterly order book.  “We expect strong deal-wins of $10 bn+ for the quarter, assuming normal renewal component. We do not include TCV from (the) mega deal with BSNL that is likely to be signed with TCS. TCS' commentary on growth outlook will be keenly followed. TCS is expected to be a beneficiary of higher focus of enterprises on cost take-outs and core modernisation,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in their note prior to the earnings.  For the entire fiscal, TCS has reported a revenue of Rs 2.25 lakh crore, which is 17.6 percent higher than Rs 1.91 lakh crore recorded in FY22. The net profit in FY23 came in at Rs 42,303 crore, which is also higher as compared to Rs 38,449 crore in the previous year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-rajesh-gopinathan-says-quarter-weaker-than-expected-q4fy23-tcv-at-10-bn-10403481.html

That's been planned and then we're going to be executing on that,&quot; he said.  On changes after taking over, Krithivasan said they are not in a hurry to do any structural or organisational change. &quot;We will talk to the associates, to our customers, we will see what is required and do whatever is required at the time,&quot; he said.  Krithivasan is a TCS lifer, having been with the company for 34 years. Before his elevation, Krithivasan was the global head of the company’s BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) business group, the largest vertical for the company which accounts for 35-40 percent of the revenue.  Krithivasan has been a CEO waiting in the wings for a while now, having been one of the contenders even when Gopinathan was appointed in 2017.  Sources previously told Moneycontrol that Krithivasan has built a reputation for being great at execution. While Gopinathan is an intellectual, brilliant thinker and strategic leader, Krithivasan can execute any blueprint, they said.  Chirajeet Sengupta, partner, global technology services, at consulting firm Everest Group, had said at that time of the incoming CEO’s appointment that Krithivasan is a very credible leader.  “He [Krithivasan] well-liked, well-respected, and well-known by clients. He's been in the trenches. He's been with clients for pretty much his entire career,” he said. “Rajesh was the CFO becoming a CEO, whereas Krithi has been a business unit leader. I think that is an important distinction to make when you think of somebody becoming the CEO of an organisation,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/incoming-tcs-ceo-k-krithivasan-to-take-over-on-june-1-2023-10403281.html
TCS,2023-04-12T17:47:02+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,"TCS slashes hiring to 22,600 in FY23 from 1.03 lakh a year back",The net headcount addition in FY23 has seen a steep decline of 78 percent from FY22. The company had previously also attributed the decreased hiring in FY23 to increased hiring in the preceding fiscal.  ,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which kicked off the earnings season on April 12, added 22,600 employees during FY23, a steep decrease as compared to its net addition in FY22. In the previous year, it had added 1.03 lakh employees on a net basis during the year. With this, the company’s headcount as of March 31, 2023, stood at 6,14,795.  This is the company’s lowest net headcount addition since FY15 when it had added 19,000 employees on a net basis during the year.  The company had added 40,185 employees on a net basis in FY21, 24,179 in FY20 and 29,287 in FY19.  During the last quarter of the fiscal, TCS saw a marginal increase of 821 employees on a net basis after last quarter’s decline of 2,197 employees, signalling the current stress in the IT sector. TCS added 35,209 employees in the same quarter last year.  TCS added 14,136 employees in Q1FY23, 9,840 in Q2, saw a decrease of 2,197 employees in Q3, and an increase of 821 in Q4.  Milind Lakkad, the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer, said, “We are honouring all job offers, and have added 22,600 employees on a net basis in FY 23. During the year, we onboarded over 44K freshers and our highest-ever number of experienced professionals.”  Last quarter, Lakkad said the hiring slowdown was not a blip, but was planned this way.  Attrition for the quarter fell to 20.1 percent, continuing its downward trend from last quarter’s 21.3 percent. As the talent market cools off, attrition rates have continued to normalise further, and it is also in line with the management’s commentary about attrition being expected to fall in coming quarters.  The hiring slowdown is on expected lines, as companies take a cautious approach to fresh hiring after the highs of FY22.  Experts Moneycontrol spoke to recently also expected a hiring slowdown in Q4FY23, and expect hiring to be subdued for at least the first two quarters of FY24.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-adds-22600-employees-on-net-basis-in-fy23-steep-decline-from-1-3-lakh-in-fy22-10403031.html
TCS,2023-04-10T16:08:50+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"All eyes on CEO successor in waiting, BFSI contagion as TCS kicks off earnings season",A poll by CNBC TV18 shows that overall growth for Q4 is expected to be less than in Q3 as uncertainty continues to prevail amidst a tough business environment. QoQ revenue growth estimates have varied from 0.1 percent to 1.7 percent.,"An outgoing chief executive officer (CEO). A successor waiting in the wings. A crushing banking crisis -- the January-March quarter has been full of unexpected turns for the country’s biggest information technology (IT) services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).  TCS kick starts the fourth quarter IT earnings season on April 12. A source in the know said CEO-designate K Krithivasan too will be present at the presser even as current CEO and managing director (MD) Rajesh Gopinathan announces the Q4 performance.  The stage is set for Krithivasan to take over as TCS CEO, nearly six years after he was considered for the position alongside Gopinathan.  This TCS earnings call will be unlike any other in recent times, as discussions are expected to take an interesting turn amid anticipation for updates on organisational and business restructuring, a new BFSI head, navigating a global macro environment, hiring plans, and more.  Here are five key aspects to watch out for at the TCS earnings call:  Commentary on business strategy changes  Krithivasan, who was appointed as a the new CEO and MD-designate on March 16, has maintained that there won’t be any great organisational or strategic changes as he takes over and Gopinathan continues with the company still September. The company is also in talks with Gopinathan for further engagement in an advisory role.  However, sources told Moneycontrol that TCS’ organisational overhaul into four distinctive business groups unveiled in April 2022, categorising clients based on their journeys with TCS caused unrest for several senior leaders in the firm. Krithivasan who was then heading the global BFSI vertical reportedly kept his vertical out of these restructured units.  Gopinathan’s current tenure as CEO and MD was to end in 2027. So, his sudden resignation came as a shock. He said that the monotony of earnings for the past 40 quarters and doing the same thing every 13 weeks got the better of him and he wanted to move on to doing something new.  Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang, said in his note, “While the new CEO, K Krithivasan, has not indicated any radical change in strategy, we would wait to see if there are any minor tweaks to it (especially around the new corporate structure of addressing different sets of clients which was instituted a year back and was indicated to be ex-CEO, Rajesh Gopinathan’s idea).”  Impact of the banking crisis  Not just TCS, but rivals too will be tracked closely for any commentary on how the BFSI sector crisis will impact demand outlook and overall global client sentiments. This quarter was marked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and Signature Bank of the US, followed by Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and the likely impact on the sectors and industries dependent on it. As of the quarter-ended December, BFSI accounted for over 38 percent of TCS’ revenue.  Pai said, “The commentary around BFSI will be keenly watched, as TCS has likely got the highest exposure in the Tier-1 set with large relationships developed over the decades in both, the US as well as Europe.”  According to analysts, while the collapse of these regional US-based banks won't have a direct impact on the Indian IT services firms, but there are some delays expected in decision making in the near term, for the next six months.  Revenue growth  According to a poll by CNBC TV18, overall growth for Q4 is expected to be less than in Q3 as uncertainty continues to prevail amidst a tough business environment. Quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth estimates have varied from 0.1 percent to 1.7 percent.  Analysts estimate a muted revenue growth on QoQ basis, but TCS is likely to lead Tier-I IT companies in terms of growth reported.  “We expect muted revenue growth for TCS over the next two quarters at 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent QoQ in CC (constant currency) terms due to delay in decision-making in its two most important geographies, North America and Continental Europe, which together account for roughly 70 percent of its overall revenues,” analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note.  Analysts added, “We expect revival of demand starting September 2023 with postponed projects getting executed, along with cost optimisation deals.”  Meanwhile, analysts at Kotak Institutional Securities forecast a much higher QoQ revenue growth at 1.1 percent and 11.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) in CC terms. “Growth will likely be led by spending on cloud and digital programs, cost take-outs and wallet share/vendor consolidation gains. Exposure to impacted banking clients will not materially impact revenue growth in our view in the quarter,” the note said.  So far, the highest QoQ revenue growth estimate for Q4 has been from Nomura at 1.7 percent.  EBIT margins are likely to improve by 40-50 basis points (bps) QoQ from Q3’s 24.5 percent, according to estimates by analysts. Commentary on how the company reaches the pre-COVID margin range of 26-28 percent will be tracked.  Hiring updates  For the first time in the past 10 quarters, TCS reported a slowdown in net new quarterly employee addition at negative 2,197 in Q3FY23. Will there be further slowdown in employee addition, what will be the hiring targets and outlook as we move into FY24 – these will be key questions.  At TCS, attrition rates since the beginning of FY23, have continued to improve. TCS’ Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), Milind Lakkad, in the previous quarter said the drop in headcount addition was a “planned” move to improve utilisation rates. TCS, like its peers, had hired in large numbers in 2022.  Analysts forecast that in this quarter too, the hiring numbers will be controlled as it looks to improve margins and utilisation rates.  Commentary on large deal-wins  Irrespective of the global macro challenges, TCS continued to report large multi-year deal-wins last quarter. In February, TCS announced the extension partnership with United Kingdom-based client Phoenix Group in a $723-million deal. According to media reports, TCS is also set to close multiple deals worth $1 billion with British retailer Marks and Spencer (M&amp;amp;S).  While previously TCS had said that it will maintain a QoQ total contract value (TCV) of $7-9 billion, analysts estimate that the company might cross this band in Q4.  “We expect strong deal-wins of $10 bn+ for the quarter, assuming normal renewal component. We do not include TCV from (the) mega deal with BSNL that is likely to be signed with TCS. TCS' commentary on growth outlook will be keenly followed. TCS is expected to be a beneficiary of higher focus of enterprises on cost take-outs and core modernisation,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in their note.  Will this deal-win momentum continue, what’s the demand outlook for FY24 – these would be worth noting.

There would be no change in strategy as of now, Krithivasan, who takes charge in the financial year 2023-24, said. TCS has a core set of beliefs that it would continue with, while strategy and priorities would be recalibrated in keeping with market conditions, he said.  ‘It's a continuum'  “We (Rajesh Gopinathan and Krithivasan) have enjoyed every moment in this organization. It's a continuum. It's not that as every CEO changes, we come up with a new strategy or new set of priorities. We have a core set of beliefs and values. We're focusing on employees, focusing on our customers is the most important engine that drives our growth. We always try to be close to our customers,” he said.  Like his predecessor Gopinathan, Krithivasan is also a TCS lifer who has been with the company for 34 years.  Read: A day of mixed feelings: Rajesh Gopinathan, on resigning from TCS  Gopinathan, who will stay on till September 15, said he wanted to ensure that the transition was smooth and would be available to Krithivasan 100 percent.  Before his elevation, Krithivasan was the global head of the company’s BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) business group, the largest vertical for the company which accounts for 35-40 percent of the revenue.  He has held various roles, including delivery, customer relationship management, large program management, and sales.  Read: Who is K Krithivasan? The newly-appointed CEO of TCS  Krithivasan, who will move to Mumbai from Chennai, said in a lighter vein that it was the move that was harder than taking on the role.  He takes on the mantle at 58, which is relatively late compared to his peers in other top Indian IT companies.  Gopinathan said that the retirement age for executive directors at TCS was 65, which gives Krithivasan at least six years, and appointments for five-year terms.  Commenting on how the Board chose Krithivasan, Gopinathan said, “If you look at the history when I took over, your questions were is this guy too young? Now Krithi is taking over, your question is this guy too old? Those kinds of questions will keep on coming.  “The board and NRC looked at a complete variety of candidates and current situations and what is required and what they felt is the best fit. And the unanimous choice was that Krithi is the best fit and the best person for the job at this point in time.”  Challenging times  He also takes on the role at a time when the IT sector is facing significant headwinds amid a challenging demand environment and macroeconomic climate.  “As the market situation changes, we’ll recalibrate what we want to do, where we want to focus on and I'm sure along with Rajesh in the next six months, we will rework on what we have to do,” Krithivasan said.  He said they believed that every change in the market was a new opportunity.  “Just because we have a macroeconomic situation doesn't mean the customers are done with all the digital transformation and they have to stop doing any transformation. If at all, there is actually more need to continue and maybe for a quarter or two, this disturbance will remain.  “But growth has to come back, our customers have to transform and leverage all the digital technologies available. We will continue to focus on transforming our customers, bringing technology to the center of their business. In the short answer, we will not make any change we will continue to focus on core principles and fine-tune as we go along,” Krithivasan said.  He added that the company didn’t see any insurmountable challenges ahead of it.  For now, Krithivasan said their role was to remove hurdles faced by associates, so that they could perform well.  “We will look at what is the best way to reorganize yourself as required. We don't expect any dramatic change in terms of how we are going to reorganize. In terms of priorities and strategy, what we'll focus on is core principles.  “Strategy and priority, we'll tweak as we go along every year, the core principle is work closely with customers, look at what their needs are as proactively as possible. Go to them with the solutions and work with our associates who have been the bedrock of our success... You should not expect to see a great strategy change or organizational change coming in,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-ceo-designate-krithivasan-rules-out-great-organisational-or-strategy-reboot-10264621.html
TCS,2023-03-17T10:25:45+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Newly-appointed TCS CEO was asked a question in Hindi. How he responded,Krithi Krithivasan was asked whether moving to Mumbai would be more challenging than transitioning to TCS CEO. Here's what he said. ,"For Krithi Krithivasan, the newly-appointed CEO of Tata Consultancy Services, the biggest challenge may not be taking on the role of the top boss, but moving from Chennai to Mumbai in order to do so.  Krithivasan, based out of Chennai, has been with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for over 34 years. Before he became the CEO designate, he was President and Global Head of the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) Business Group, the largest and the most prominent vertical of the company in terms of revenue contribution, deals and business.  As a TCS veteran, it’s safe to assume that Krithivasan is well-versed in the company culture and knows what’s coming his way when he takes over as CEO in the next financial year. But one thing he might be unprepared for is the move to Mumbai.  At a press conference this morning with outgoing TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, Krithivasan was asked what the bigger challenge for him would be: Becoming the CEO of TCS or moving to Mumbai.  “I would say moving to Mumbai,” K Krithivasan replied, chuckling. “Leaving Chennai is a tough decision. People that know the culture will know.”   A little later during the press conference, Krithivasan and Gopinathan were both asked a question each in Hindi. Gopinathan answered his question about leaving TCS in Hindi.  Krithivasan, who was asked what the biggest challenge for him would be in taking TCS forward, politely refused to answer the question in Hindi. “I love Hindi so much, I don’t want to abuse it by talking in Hindi now,” he said.  “I don’t think there are any insurmountable challenges ahead of us,” he continued. “I think we have a lot of opportunities. How do we leverage and seize those opportunities is the task ahead of us.”  Rajesh Gopinathan has tendered his resignation as TCS MD and CEO after a 22-year career with the IT behemoth.

Kaustubh Chaubal, Senior Vice President, Moody’s, noted that a solid balance sheet characterised by high liquidity and net cash position reflects the companies’ “good corporate governance practices.”  The reason the ratings of both companies are constrained to just two points above that of India (Baa3) is their exposure to the changing tax regulations in the country. Nonetheless, diverse operations, a history of strong operating results and profitability, remarkable free cash flow generating capabilities and minimal dependence on the Indian banking system helped Infosys and TCS remain at Baa1 rating.  Infosys  Moody's expects around 13 percent revenue growth for Infosys for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. However, a moderation in growth is expected in fiscal 2024, when revenue growth is likely to decelerate to 8 percent.  However, a steady decline in attrition rate amidst global uncertainties is expected to keep margin pressure from mounting. The EBITDA margin is expected to remain at around 24 percent from fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2025.  Moody’s also deemed Infosys’ outlook as stable. “The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that Infosys will maintain its robust business model and competitive market position compared with its global peers,” Moody’s noted in its credit rating announcement.  Tata Consultancy Services  The credit research firm also upheld the Baa1 rating of Infosys’ peer TCS, based on its “globally diversified, cost competitive operations that translate into its industry-leading profitability and robust credit profile.”  Moody's expects TCS’ revenues to clinch 8 percent growth for the fiscal year 2023, but water down to around 5 percent for the fiscal years 2024 and 2025.  Coming to profitability, TCS’ EBITDA margin is expected to stay around 25 percent during the down years, supported by steadily declining attrition and improving employee utilisation.  TCS’ largely unleveraged balance sheet and superior liquidity position should help the company return 80 percent to 100 percent of its free cash flow to shareholders.  The outlook for the company was also deemed by Moody’s as stable.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/companies-2/moodys-upholds-baa1-rating-pertaining-to-infosys-and-tcs-10090511.html
TCS,2023-02-06T09:46:05+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,A bull run in the making? Experts frame top 10 trading ideas for next 3-4 weeks,"In the near term, the index is expected to take support at 17,600, which has been holding quite well on every closing in the past six consecutive sessions, with resistance at the 18,000-18,250 zone","The market recouped more than half of its previous week's losses and climbed 250 points or 1.4 percent on the Nifty50 during the week ended February 3. The recovery is largely attributed to the short covering-led buying in beaten-down banking and financial services and select Adani Group stocks along with fall in oil prices.  The Nifty50 finally settled above the 17,800 mark, the lower band of previous trading range (17,800-18,250) seen before the recent correction, after taking strong support at 200 DMA (around 17,300).  In the near term, the index is expected to take support at 17,600, which has been holding quite well on every closing in the past six consecutive sessions, with resistance at the 18,000-18,250 zone but, considering the recent news-led activity, further volatility can't be ruled out, experts said.  &quot;Although we managed to recover the lost ground this week, we are not completely out of the woods yet. A continuous news flow with respect to the Adani group is likely to give volatile swings on both sides,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  As far as the levels are concerned, he feels, the immediate support is visible around 17,600; but the major sacrosanct zone remains at 17,400 – 17,300, which coincides with the 200-day SMA. &quot;Ideally, till the time we defend this, there is no real reason to worry for,&quot; Chavan said.  On the flipside, if the market has to regain its pride, the Nifty needs to surpass 18,000 – 18,100 on a closing basis, which will confirm the completion of the recent corrective phase and market can then resume the higher degree uptrend, the expert said.  He advised that the banking space needs to be watched closely because it is likely to act as a catalyst for setting the near-term direction for the market. Apart from this, a lot of thematic moves started playing out well towards the end of the week. One must keep focusing on such potential trading opportunities, he said.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the February 3 closing prices:  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,337 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 12 percent  The stock spent a lot of time between the Rs 1,800 and Rs 1,600 levels during September and November 2022. However, since the stock has broken the trading range at Rs 1,600, we saw a significant fall in the stock towards Rs 1,246 level without any meaningful pullback. The pullback has sent the stock into the highly oversold zone.  Technically, such a pattern could result in a move back to retrace the sell-off. Based on it, the positional traders should be buyers at the current levels with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,240. On the upside, it will find resistance at Rs 1,450 or Rs 1,500.

TCS,2023-01-31T17:37:47+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,Net employee addition by top 5 IT Services companies dips into the negative in Q3,"Headcount addition is considered an indicator of demand in the IT industry, and the current drop comes as firms go slow on hiring in an increasingly cautious macro environment.","The number of employees in the top five Information Technology services companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra — has declined since the last quarter, the first time since the first quarter of FY 21.  While the companies together added 34,713 employees in the second quarter of financial year 2023, in the third quarter, they lost 4,904. This is a 114 percent dip quarter-on-quarter for the five companies when it comes to net addition.  Headcount addition is considered an indicator of demand in the industry, and the current drop comes as firms go slow on hiring in an increasingly cautious macro environment.  As recession concerns loom in the US and Europe amid interest rate increases to tackle inflation and the war in Ukraine, Indian IT firms are under pressure as Western clients slow discretionary spending.  The companies attributed the lower or negative net headcount addition in the third quarter to talent investments they had made previously, as well as increasing workforce utilisation metrics.  Tech Mahindra, which reported its results on January 30, saw the steepest reduction in headcount among these five companies, ending the quarter with 6,844 fewer employees.  It joined ranks with Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, which saw a reduction in headcount sequentially by 2,197 and 435 employees respectively.  Past trends  This was the first time in 10 quarters that the headcount at the end of a quarter for TCS and Wipro was lower than in the previous quarter. Tech Mahindra had last seen a decline in Q4 of FY21, which makes this reduction the first in seven quarters.  Infosys and HCLTech, on the other hand, reported a moderate increase in headcount sequentially.  While Infosys saw its headcount go up by 1,627 employees, HCLTech led the pack with an addition of 2,945 employees. This isn’t to say that headcount addition hasn’t slowed for these two companies either.  Since Q1 of FY21, when all companies reported a net reduction in their headcount, their hiring has increased significantly thanks to unprecedented pandemic-accelerated demand for digital transformation.  Tech Mahindra was the aberration, as it saw a reduction in headcount for three quarters in FY21.    Following the reduction in headcount in April-June 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, the net addition of the other four companies increased dramatically between Q2 of FY21 and Q4 of FY22.  IT growth climate  Tech Mahindra’s headcount addition in this fiscal year has been on a downward trajectory, as it added 6,862 employees in Q1FY23 and 5,877 employees in Q2FY23.  CFO Rohit Anand attributed this to the business process services segment and quarterly seasonal rampdown that happened based on the increase last year.  “The current IT growth environment is reflective of this headcount reduction as well as our endeavour to improve our utilisation,&quot; he said.  Anand told analysts that hiring going forward will be “very closely aligned and monitored with the demand environment that we see.”  The company’s leadership maintained that there may be room to increase utilisation as well, and would focus on getting its to its previous level of 88 percent.  He added that the demand scenario is not as robust as it was two quarters back, and with easing supply-side challenges and uncertainties in the market, Tech Mahindra was trying to hire just in time.  “The macro environment is relatively volatile. So we just want that maybe while we are actioning closer and linking ourselves to the macro environment, the linearity of correlation between headcount and growth is also diluting a little bit,” he said.  Hiring ahead of time  TCS Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said the company had invested in talent ahead of time, and it was making them productive, adding that it doesn’t indicate anything on the demand front.  Wipro’s Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil said the company invested in talent ahead of time and had low utilisation and bench strength.  “We have headspace of four or five percentage points by utilisation. We are hiring and training them and keeping them ready to manage demand. From a supply-chain perspective, we don't see a challenge,” Govil said.  Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said the company wants to ensure that all the talent it has hired is trained and ready to be deployed.  Ramachandran Sundararajan, Chief People Officer at HCL Tech, which saw the highest net addition this quarter, said the hiring was a function of attrition and campus hiring in the previous quarter, when the company took in a higher number of freshers.  Sundararajan added that gross hiring will be moderated when there is a significant drop in attrition, and looking at a one-quarter decline and extrapolating it to future demand may not give the true picture.  No green shoots yet  While company leadership say the environment isn't sombre, data for January 2023 paints a different picture.  According to data from Xpheno’s jobs outlook report for January, the IT services sector saw a 7 percent drop in demand in comparison to December 2022. It had slid for seven months before going up in November.  Xpheno said the IT Services sector registered the second lowest active demand over a 24-month period, with 65,000 active job openings at the end of the month.  The lowest was in October 2022, at 60,000. On a year-on-year basis as well, the sector had its second sharpest drop as available jobs in January 2023 were 49.5 percent fewer than in January 2022.  With the drop in volume, Xpheno said the IT services sector’s contribution to overall job openings continues to be below the 30 percent mark for the fourth month.  “With just 23 percent contribution to Active Jobs, IT Services sector continues to lose its dominating spot in the Industry wise contribution mix,” Xpheno said.  Anil Ethanur, the co-founder of Xpheno, said the local hiring patterns of the tech sector has been sensitive to the layoff trends over the last quarter.  “The gradual drop in hiring demand in Indian Tech Sector has been largely correctional, but currently entering a phase of negative impact if further sustained. On the talent acquisition front, the tech sector cannot afford to be in an uncontrolled downslope for long,” he said.  Ethanur added that while the tech sector braces for more impact of global economic movements, there is also light at the end of the tunnel as “downturns overseas tend to drive more jobs to Indian shores.”  “The current quarter will be a critical wait-and-watch quarter not just for tech but all sectors and the talent in them,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/net-employee-addition-by-top-5-it-services-companies-dips-into-the-negative-in-q3-9973611.html

The total headcount of the company at present stands at 222,270.  This is lower than the previous quarter's net addition of over 8,359 employees in Q2, but significantly lower than the 10,143 employees hired in the same quarter last fiscal.  The attrition rate decreased significantly on a QoQ basis at 21.7 percent, down from 23.8 percent in Q2 on last twelve months (LTM) basis, the company said, adding that this attrition figure excludes involuntary attrition and digital process operations. But it is much higher than 19.8 percent in the same quarter last fiscal.  HCLTech laid off 350 employees working on Microsoft's news-related products during the second quarter after the project was not renewed.  Fresher addition for the quarter came in at 5,892, which was lower than the 10,339 for Q2.  During Q1FY23 earnings call, CEO and MD C Vijayakumar had said that the company overall plans to add about 30,000 freshers this fiscal.  &quot;In the first three quarters we have added more than 22,000 freshers. We will get pretty close to our 30,000 target by Q4, but may be marginally missing the target number. That's a moderation we are doing because of the improvement in retention rates. The extent of drop we have seen in attrition rates over the past few quarters is significant,&quot; Ram Sundararajan, chief people officer at HCLTech said while addressing the media.  Hiring targets  The company previously said that it intends to hire 45,000 new employees in FY23. It also heavily outsourced employees from new frontier locations such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Romania, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Brazil.  Meanwhile, rival Infosys added 1,627 employees, a significant decrease from the 10,032  previous quarter.

TCS,2023-01-11T15:20:42+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan says there have been mindless purchases of cloud services,TCS’ CEO Gopinathan discusses aspects of mindless spending on the cloud during the pandemic-driven digital transformation demand spike. Cloud service was one of the key levers for deal wins in Q3.,"There were over-excitement and mindless purchases of cloud services amid a pandemic-fuelled digital transformation and cloud-migration activities, said Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) CEO &amp;amp; MD Rajesh Gopinathan. Cloud service was one of the key drivers of strong demand and deal pipeline for TCS in the third quarter of FY23.  In an interview with Moneycontrol, Gopinathan said this in response to whether enterprises are reassessing cloud spending given the current macro economic challenges and trends of over spending on cloud last year for even basic workloads.  “There definitely has been over excitement on Cloud, and some amount of mindless purchases and mindless commitments. And I think people over-simplified the cloud proposition, saying that if I migrate to the cloud, I'm going to get a very variable-sized cost base. And it is going to be cheaper than my capex cycle,” he said.  The CEO added, “Technically, the ‘variablisation’ is true. But to get to that variablisation, you need to do the transformation of your application because just lifting your application from a datacentre kind of setup, and putting it into a cloud will not automatically get you a variablisation.”  Gopinathan explained that to migrate to the cloud mindfully, the companies would first need to modify or architect their existing applications accordingly, and that will require a certain amount of initial investment. Without this, cloud migration could be a “net costlier proposition.”  This will then lead to specific project-led cloud spending by companies, in an attempt to bring down cloud costs.  “Once you have architected it, it actually unleashes a second round of transformation, which is the right reason to go to the cloud. You can open up your architecture for much more composable functionality so that as your business model shifts, you will be able to move faster with it, or your upgrade cycles will be faster,” he said.  Gopinathan said that TCS is uniquely positioned when it comes to moving to the next phase of digital transformation, and has seen over two years of demand spike and cloud migration. From both cost optimisation and phase two of transformation deals perspective, TCS will be in a position to benefit in terms of deal wins.  Ultimately, he said, “Leaving all of it aside for an enterprise, the cloud is a much safer, much more reliable, and much more secure environment. So, enterprises are much better off in the cloud than in the data centre. But there is work to be done to realise the cost-benefit.”  Sharing his outlook on growth drivers for deal wins during TCS’ Q3 earnings announcement, Gopinathan said that a lot of work is happening on the cloud as a lot has been invested into it already.  “From actual project work related to the cloud, there's quite a lot of work yet to be done. We are very strongly participating in that. You can consider whether to call it digital transformation or not. But it is truly transformative. And that will continue well into the year,” he said.  N Ganapathy Subramaniam, COO, TCS added, “Tech spending is holding up specifically in terms of large deals related to cloud transformation.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-ceo-rajesh-gopinathan-says-there-has-been-mindless-purchases-of-cloud-services-9847871.html
TCS,2023-01-11T13:17:09+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,TCS to roll out 100% variable pay to junior employees for Q3FY23,"For senior employees, the individual variable payout is based on business unit performance. ","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will give full variable pay to all junior-level employees for the third quarter, according to an email from the Chief Human Resources Officer, Milind Lakkad. This is despite a challenging business environment, where TCS had fewer deal wins, but still managed to beat expectations on the revenue front.  “A decision has been taken to pay 100% of the Quarterly Variable Allowance (QVA) for all employees up to C2 or equivalent grades covered under this plan,” said the email accessed by Moneycontrol. These include trainees and IT analysts.  For mid and senior-level employees, the individual variable payout is based on business unit performance. “The individual pay-out for C3A or equivalent grades and above (as applicable) may vary, depending on the business unit performance,” a note by Lakkad said. C3A and above grades are assistant consultant, associate consultant and consultant, senior and principal consultant.  TCS paid out 100 percent of variable pay to junior-level employees during the previous quarter as well.  TCS did not respond to Moneycontrol's queries.  During the quarter, the company reported a net reduction in headcount, with 2,197 fewer employees on its payroll than the previous quarter. It also saw its net headcount reduce sequentially for the first time in ten quarters, the last time being in the first quarter of FY21. As of December 31, 2022, the company's headcount was 6,13,974.

TCS,2023-01-10T17:02:24+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Why has TCS’ net headcount reduced in Q3FY23? CEO Rajesh Gopinathan explains,"In an interview to Moneycontrol, Rajesh Gopinathan said  the company doubled its typical trainee intake during the quarters of increased demand in the 2021 calendar year.","Tata Consultancy Services' net headcount reduction in Q3FY23 must be seen in the context of the pandemic's demand spike period in 2021, as well as the trainees it has now deployed, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said in an interview with Moneycontrol's Chandra R Srikanth. This comes as the company reported its first net headcount decrease in ten quarters amid a challenging demand environment.  According to Gopinathan, the company doubled its typical trainee intake during the quarters of increased demand in the 2021 calendar year.  “In fiscal year 2021, when the industry went through a demand spike, we had called it early that we expect the demand will return strongly by December 2020, and onwards. We significantly increased campus offers and off-campus hiring in the 2021 calendar year. When I say significantly, we had more than doubled our typical intake,” he said, adding that the company invested at the bottom of the pyramid, trained them, and deployed them simultaneously to backfill peak attrition rates.  In the seven quarters preceding FY23, the company’s net addition had increased each quarter to keep pace with the demand.   Also read: Level of tolerance between a disaster quarter and a great quarter is 50 basis points: TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan  In Q3FY23, TCS' headcount closed down 2,197 employees from the previous quarter. The last time the headcount addition was in the negative was in Q1FY21, during the first wave of the pandemic. As of December 31, 2022, the company had 6,13,974 employees on its rolls.   Explaining the headcount reduction, Gopinathan said that between December 2021 to December 2022 period, the company had added between 55,000-60,000 employees on a net basis.  In 2021, he said they decided to bring in all their trainees in two quarters rather than spreading it throughout the year, and took in 35,000 freshers, he said.  “We tested whether we'll be able to absorb it, and how does it play out for us? We had done such experiments a couple of years before the pandemic and then went on to a normal cycle. So we knew that we could flex this system,” he said.   He added that headcount growth in 2021 was ahead of revenue growth, and that headcount growth in 2021 and 2022 together is roughly in line with revenue.  However, the period during which TCS doubled its campus hires intake was also marked by elevated attrition levels across the industry.  Gopinathan said that TCS’ approach was that as attrition increased, they must invest at the bottom of the pyramid and train them so that the company has the people available to backfill that attrition.   “At the peak attrition levels, we needed to be much more focused on lateral recruitment to backfill it. But what is really happening is the pool that we hired in calendar 2021, is becoming much more productive. And we are backfilling attrition using that pool, rather than lateral,” he said.   Now, Gopinathan said that they will resume their regular hiring cycle.   Attrition too has begun to moderate. While it was 21.3 percent in Q3FY23 (down from 21.5 percent the previous quarter), the company's management stated that quarterly annualised attrition has decreased by nearly 6%.  The company hired around 7,000 freshers in Q3FY23, taking the total number of freshers hired this fiscal to around 42,000.  Gopinathan said that attrition is not backfilled from the current hiring but from previous hiring, internal resources and lateral hiring.  “As attrition comes into control our ability to backfill attrition with internally trained resources increases. When attrition peaks, you need to backfill laterally. But we are able to do that,” he said.   He added that attrition moderating is important for TCS’ business model.  “It improves operational stability as delivery quality, customer satisfaction, everything is high when attrition is low. It's very critical to our business model, plus the cost benefit of that. When you're doing lateral hiring in a much accelerated manner, price points become unreasonable. Now it is much more rational,” he said.   During the analyst call too, Gopinathan stated that the hiring trend should be more normal from here on, with a gross employee addition of 1.25-1.5 lakh expected for the year. Along with lower attrition rates, he added that this will give the company enough capacity to handle growth, and they can bring in talent on a short-term basis depending on demand.  The company currently has over 1.25 lakh employees at the mid and senior levels who have been with the company on average for over a decade.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/why-has-tcs-net-headcount-reduced-in-q3fy23-ceo-rajesh-gopinathan-explains-9841931.html

Gopinathan was confident about double-digit growth will return to the industry, even as analysts have predicted a great reset for the IT sector after a period of aggressive pandemic growth and hiring.  In an interview with Moneycontrol after the company’s third-quarter earnings, he was upbeat about growth from a medium to long-term perspective.  On whether things will get worse before it gets better, Gopinathan said, “I think the answer to that is no, it’s likely to stay where it is. And then probably get better is our expectation. The current hesitancy will continue for some time and from there it will improve.”  Also read: Level of tolerance between a disaster quarter and a great quarter is 50 basis points: TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan  “The US especially, the whole macroeconomic situation is likely to be for a shorter period.

It is not just vendor consolidation, it is higher market share in incremental spend. On both sides, I believe we are very well positioned. So, we think that we will participate and gain share on both sides on the incremental spend, and on the existing spend.”  Also read: TCS has over 1.25 lakh mid, senior level employees serving it for over 10 years  In terms of growth rate, while TCS is expected to end FY23 with a growth rate of over 13%, analysts at Kotak expect a moderation in growth in FY24 to 8.1% amid an increasingly slowing demand environment.  On whether 8 percent will be the new normal or if the company will return to double-digit growth, Gopinathan said, “If you think about where that negativity is coming from, one, it is coming from a geopolitical situation, which is unlikely to be the new normal in Europe. If you look at it from the US perspective, the transition between cheap money and costly money, the transition is what is creating the current volatility, it is not that it is not one or the other”  “So, this year, the immediate negativity that is coming, are both of transient nature. How long will that transiency last? And that is, you know, we have a perspective that in US, it will be much shorter and in Europe, it is likely to weaken similar to what where the market is. But this is not the new normal”, he said that he is confident that growth will return to double digits.  He added that what is underlying the confidence is that the technology cycle has moved decisively towards a new, cloud-based architecture, which still has huge headroom for growth. He further said that there is a plethora of new things which gives even more credence that business models will become even more technology dependent, and even more deeply embedded in technology.

On his 10-year-journey in the company, this being his 40th earnings report, Gopinathan said: “I think we have been fairly successful, that we've been continuously able to move in the direction that we want to move, but we have not lost intensity on that cycle. So getting a better appreciation of that, and having the confidence and satisfaction of having done it for an extended period of time. I think that's what I would say that is my thoughts on the 10 years.”  “The things that we're trying not to change is to keep the intensity high. Because it's easy to rationalize what happens, but always pushing me to be slightly more than where it is currently,” Gopinathan added speaking about how the company functions.

You know, that situation is bad, why don't you lower your target? Why don't you cut yourself some room, we have always believed that the philosophy should be that, you know, it's like, there used to be an old paper called strategy as stretch. So you need to keep your targets slightly outside the realm of what you can easily reach, and then keep moving towards that. So not losing the intensity, and staying respectful to the if you're in this role, you're accountable on a quarterly basis, staying respectful to that, not losing intensity, but at the same time, not getting lost in it, and being able to keep the long term view in place. And the big keeping on moving it directionally in the long term view without losing the intensity of the short 13-week cycle. I think that's the biggest thing.”  Also read: Level of tolerance between a disaster quarter and a great quarter is 50 basis points: Rajesh Gopinathan  Saying that TCS as a company is “continuously transforming”, the CEO said, “So if you look at it, we are very different today than what we were five years ago or 10 years ago, 15 years ago. We got to keep on moving. Both maintaining the continuity as well as the driving the change has been the big focus.”  On any passion projects that he wanted to pursue this year, Gopinathan said: “Not much that I'd like to call out of that nature, but our industry keeps changing.

The company, which reported a reduction of 2,197 employees during the third quarter of FY23 sequentially, said on January 9 that its workforce as of December 2022 was 6,13,974. The company’s net addition has been declining each quarter in FY23.  Speaking to analysts, Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan said the company’s incremental hiring must be seen in the context of the capacity they have built up so far.  “We have significantly invested in building up capacity in 2021, tried as much as possible to bypass the industry's hire-from-each-other attrition cycle and focused on hiring at entry level and invested in training and cross-training our resources. That investment has hit our productive capacity and stood us in the stead. So, the incremental hiring that we saw this year should be seen in the context of what we've done in the last year also. And overall, we are very comfortable with where we are with our net headcount,” he said.  He added that there should be a more normal hiring trend, and they expect gross hiring in the range of 1.25-1.5 lakh for the year. Along with an expected normalisation of attrition levels,  Gopinathan said they will have sufficient capacity to take care of growth. “Then we can keep bringing in shorter-term hiring to take care of demand as it unfolds,” he said.  Lakkad said that net hiring last year was “significantly ahead” of revenue growth. The focus this year is to utilise that excess capacity and make the new hires productive, he said.  Attrition also saw a slight decline from the previous quarter to 21.3 percent from 21.5 percent on a last-twelve-month basis.  “LTM attrition in IT Services was at 21.3 percent, slightly down quarter-on-quarter, but still very elevated as it reflects the high levels of churn in the prior quarters.

TCS,2023-01-09T21:12:00+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan remains upbeat amid challenging demand scenario,TCS Q3 Earnings: The company said that growth this quarter was driven by cloud services and market share gains through vendor consolidation. ,"Tata Consultancy Services, which reported its numbers for Q3FY23 on January 9, saw its Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan remaining upbeat even amid a challenging demand scenario for the sector. This was particularly in the US and UK markets, from where the company derives a majority of its revenue from. However, he was cautious about the situation in Europe.  Gopinathan told reporters that in the medium term, they have very strong confidence in the US and UK, while Europe is difficult to call.  “US and UK account for about two-third of our business, so we are quite comfortable. In Europe, we have a very strong presence on the ground. We should be able to navigate it and on a relative basis we should be able to navigate Europe well compared to all other players. So we are confident about our ability to play Europe,” he said.  ALSO READ: TCS Q3 result: Net profit rises 11% to Rs 10,883 crore, revenue up 19%  He added that only time will tell if the problem in the US is real one, and that they currently believe it is transient.  “There is no structural problem in US and we are quite positive on the medium term. The immediate short term is difficult to call, we'll have to see, but US we are quite positive.,” he added.  TCS currently has the highest exposure to Europe and the UK among its peers, generating nearly 30 percent of its revenue from these markets, which have been weak due to macroeconomic challenges. But in Q3, the growth was led by the UK market along with North America.  ALSO READ: TCS headcount reduces by 2,197 employees, declines for the first time in 10 quarters  The total contract value (TCV) for the third quarter of FY23 for TCS was $7.8 billion. This was in line with management's guidance of a TCV run rate of $7-9 billion per quarter. Last quarter's order book was $8.1 billion, as compared to $7.6 billion at the same time last year.  “We are pleased with our strong growth in a seasonally weak quarter, driven by cloud services, market share gains through vendor consolidation, and continued momentum in North America and UK,” Gopinathan said in a statement.  He added that in the customer base they focus on, they have seen vendor consolidation where clients are preferring large vendors like TCS, and here the company has market share gains when it comes to the spend at a customer-level, he said.  On the nature of the demand, Gopinathan said he expects this year to be a more balanced year. “A lot more balanced in terms of cost optimization, cost-based transformation deals, and that varies by market,” he said.  Speaking on the types of deals he is bullish on, N Ganapathy Subramaniam, COO, TCS said, “Tech spending is holding up specifically in terms of large deals related to cloud transformation. We are seeing some weaknesses in mortgages and insurance. Consequently, banks might be planning some exposure reduction to these offerings. Capital markets/ trading side of it is looking good. In wealth and retirement space, people are looking at technology to bring in automation.”  Gopinathan added that a lot of work is also happening on cloud because a lot of investments have gone into it.  “From actual project work related to cloud, there's quite a lot of work yet to be done. We are very strongly participating in that. You can consider whether to call it digital transformation or not. But it is truly transformative. And that will continue through the year well into the year,” he said.  During the third quarter, Rail Delivery Group, TAP Air Portugal, Al Maryah Community Bank, and CTBC Bank, headquartered in Taiwan, were among the most significant deals won. TCS is yet to officially announce a possible deal with BSNL worth over $2 billion.  TCS' growth in major markets was led by North America and the UK, which increased 15.4 percent year-on-year in constant currency, followed by Continental Europe (9.7 percent). In emerging markets, India grew 9.1 percent, Latin America grew 14.6 percent, the Middle East and Africa grew 8.6 percent, and the Asia Pacific grew 9.5 percent.  Sector-wise, Retail and CPG (18.7 percent) led the growth followed by Life Sciences &amp;amp; Healthcare verticals (+14.4 percent). Communications &amp;amp; Media grew +13.5 percent and Technology &amp;amp; Services grew +13.6 percent. Manufacturing grew +12.5 percent while BFSI grew +11.1 percent.  Some of TCS' key sectors, including retail and BFSI, are currently facing a challenging business environment in core markets like the US due to inflation, rising interest rates, a hit to the banking sector's mortgage loan sub-segment, resulting in consumers losing purchasing power, and several other ongoing macro uncertainties, particularly in the top two markets, the US and Europe.  According to leading IT analyst Moshe Katri of Wedbush Securities, TCS’ clients are approaching CY23 IT budgets cautiously though they are yet to see any indications of upcoming budget cycle delays or elongated sale cycles.  TCS has been expanding its existing customer base in terms of wallet share. Katri in his report highlighted that the IT major remains focussed on expanding wallet share from existing clients through its restructured business operations by “aligning customer size/maturity with delivery, with the intention of building confidence while creating cross-selling transformational initiatives; TCS’ business transformation group manages large/mature clients.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-ceo-rajesh-gopinathan-remains-upbeat-amid-challenging-demand-scenario-9837421.html

A contraction in the net addition number was seen previously in the first quarter of FY21, which was when India was in a complete lockdown due to the first wave of the pandemic.  The company, which announced its results for Q3FY23 on January 9, said its headcount is currently at 6,13,974, down from 6,16,171. This is the first time the net addition has declined in 10 quarters. TCS added 9,840 employees during Q2FY23, which was also a significant dip.  Milind Lakkad, the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer, however said that the hiring slowdown is not a blip, and that it was 'planned that way'.  TCS had added 28,238 employees during the same quarter last year.  Addressing the press, Lakkad said that they have made investments in fresh talent as well as in talent development to make them productive.  &quot;That investment coupled with tightening, all of that resulted in a negative headcount. That does not indicate anything on the demand side. Demand is high, we are just operating very efficiently right now,&quot; he said.  Elevated attrition, which has been a point of concern across the industry, saw a slight decline. Attrition in Q3FY23 stood at 21.3 percent, a slight decline from 21.5 percent in Q2FY23 on a last-twelve-month basis. TCS said that this attrition is expected to fall further in the coming quarters.  In Q3FY22, TCS’ attrition was 11.9 percent.  It onboarded around 7,000 freshers during the quarter, with a total of 42,000 freshers being added during the fiscal so far.  TCS had announced that it onboarded 35,000 freshers in H1FY23, of which 20,000 had been in Q2FY23. TCS hired over 1 lakh freshers in FY22, with a target of 40,000 for FY23.  “Our focus over the last few quarters on bringing in fresh talent at scale, training them on new technologies and making them productive is paying off. We are particularly proud of having 125,000 TCSers at middle and senior levels who have been with the company for more than 10 years on average. They have been central to the successful cultural integration of all the fresh talent we have onboarded in the last couple of years, and their contextual knowledge and customer-centricity have been key to the high level of customer satisfaction that TCS is known for,” said Lakkad in a statement.  For the quarter, Nirmal Bang’s Head of Research Girish Pai said the hiring slowdown was expected to continue, and that the number “will also serve as a harbinger of any growth slowdown, although the company has been saying otherwise.”  The focus this quarter will be on the impact of furloughs across the industry, which was higher than expected.  “The focus on furloughs will be high. The furlough impact was minimal in the last two years due to aggressive client spending and large deal ramp-up. We expect high furloughs in hi-tech and moderate in others,” a note by Kotak Institutional Equities said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-headcount-reduces-by-2197-employees-declines-for-the-first-time-in-10-quarters-9835371.html

Short and medium term trend remains positive as stock price is trading above all important moving averages.","The market started off the first week of New Year 2023 on a disappointing note with the Nifty50 down 1.4 percent and decisively broke the psychological 18,000 mark in the week ended January 6 after Fed officials signalled an aggressive stance to control inflation.  The index closed at 17,859 after trading within the range of previous two weeks and formed a bearish candle on the weekly time frame, but has taken support at 17,750, which is expected to be a crucial support point for the current week beginning January 9, with the initial hurdle at 18,000, followed by 18,200 levels, experts said.  &quot;As of now, we are still a bit hopeful of recovery; but in case the Nifty slides and sustains below 17,750, we must prepare for an extension of this corrective move towards 17,600 – 17,450 in the coming week,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  On the flipside, he feels that in order to regain the strength, the Nifty must reclaim 18,000 first on a closing basis. The major trend-deciding level remains at 18,300, which would turn the tide once again in favour of bulls, he said.  The market expert advised traders to keep a close tab on all these scenarios. The only positive takeaway at the end of the week would be the resilience of the broader market, he feels.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 6 closing prices:  Expert: Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative and Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities  Religare Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 176.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 164 | Target: Rs 190-199 | Return: 13 percent  After breaking out from the downward sloping trendline on the daily chart, stock price is consolidating during last few days, indicating relative strength in the stock. Short and medium term trend remains positive as stock price is trading above all important moving averages.  Momentum Oscillators - RSI (relative strength index - 11) and MFI (money flow index - 10) are sloping upwards and placed above 50 on the weekly chart, indicating strength in the stock. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 176.35-170.    Sundram Fasteners: Buy | LTP: Rs 991 | Stop-Loss: Rs 920 | Target: Rs 1,070-1,100 | Return: 11 percent  The stock price has broken out on the weekly chart from the multiple top resistance of Rs 980-985 levels. Short term trend of the stock is positive as stock price is trading above its 5 and 20-day EMA (exponential moving average).  Momentum Oscillators - RSI (11) and MFI (10) is placed above 50 on the weekly chart, indicating relative strength in the stock. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 991-950.    Minda Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 213.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 200 | Target: Rs 229-235 | Return: 10 percent  The stock price is on the verge of breaking out from the downward sloping trendline on the weekly chart. Stock price has been taking support at 200-day EMA. Intermediate trend of stock remains positive as it is trading above its 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages.  Auto ancillaries' stocks are looking good on the medium-term charts. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 213.75-208.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research ( Retail) at Kotak Securities  Cummins India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,431.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390 | Target: Rs 1,500-1,550 | Return: 8 percent  The stock has formed a higher bottom at Rs 1,351 and closed in positive territory on a weekly basis. The stock is following a bullish formation, which crossed Rs 1,270 level in October 2022.  Based on the short-term formation of the stock, technically, it is moving towards Rs 1,500-1,550 levels. Buy at the current level and place a stop-loss at Rs 1,390.    Hindalco Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 462.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 450 | Target: Rs 491 | Return: 6 percent  After making several bottoms between 425 and 430, the stock quickly reversed to Rs 491 levels. A sector-specific move supported the rally in the stock on strong gains in Asian markets.  Last week, the stock fell to Rs 460 level due to continued weakness in the US market. At current levels, the stock is attractive to buy from a trading point of view. However, a stop-loss at Rs 450 is required.    Tata Consultancy Services: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,211.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,300 | Target: Rs 3,175-3,100 | Return: 3.5 percent  The stock has formed a series of falling tops and falling bottoms, which is a bearish formation. The levels of Rs 3,300 and Rs 3,400 are acting as major resistance zone for the stock.  On Friday, the stock closed below the level of Rs 3250, which would pull the stock to Rs 3,175 or Rs 3,100 in the near term. It is advisable to sell at Rs 3,215 and at Rs 3,250. However, keep a stop loss at Rs 3,300 to protect a short sell position.    Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities  Tata Consumer Products: Sell | LTP: Rs 761.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 795 | Target: Rs 702 | Return: 8 percent  In late-December 2022, the stock witnessed a trendline breakdown and extended loss subsequently. Continuing its prior weekly falling trend, the stock slipped to 11-week low during the last week.  Its weekly RSI slipped below 50-mark post negative cross-over. This could drag the stock towards its psychological level of Rs 700, where its lowest level of May 2022 and June 2022 are also placed.  In case of any pullback, the stock may face hurdle around its extending trendline.    DLF: Sell | LTP: Rs 370 | Stop-Loss: Rs 387 | Target: Rs 346 | Return: 6.5 percent  The stock resumed its down move post a pullback. On the higher side, the stock faced hurdle around the junction of key moving averages on the daily timeframe chart.  Its daily RSI reversed before testing 50-mark. We believe undergoing negative momentum may continue, which could drag the stock towards its lowest level of September 2022.  On the higher side, its key moving averages will cap the up-move.    Tata Power: Sell | LTP: Rs 205.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 213 | Target: Rs 190 | Return: 7.5 percent  The stock reversed after testing its prior point of polarity and moved down. Its major moving averages are sloping downwards and the key technical indicators are negatively poised.  This could drag the stock towards its lowest level of June 2021.  In case of any rebound, the stock will continue to face hurdle around its prior point of polarity.    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa  Petronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 218 | Stop-Loss: Rs 206 | Target: Rs 235-240 | Return: 10 percent  The stock has seen a long consolidation phase and has traded within a broad range since last three years and has now given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance. Off late, the stock has witnessed positive momentum as the ‘89 DEMA’ has acted as a support during the recent decline.  The volumes during price corrections are low while they are rising gradually along with price upmoves indicating buying interest by market participants. The RSI Smoothed oscillator has given a positive crossover on the daily chart and is in ‘Buy Mode’ on the weekly charts too.  Considering the technical structure, we expect the stock to rally higher in the near term and hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities around current price of Rs 218. The possible near term targets for the stock are expected around Rs 235-240, while the stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 206.    Bajaj Auto: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,642 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,540 | Target: Rs 3,740-3,800 | Return: 4 percent  The stock has been consolidating within a range since last few weeks and prices have seen some pullback move from the support end of a ‘Symmetrical Triangle’ pattern. The stock has relatively shown strength as compared to broader markets since last few days and the RSI oscillator has given a positive crossover indicating a positive momentum.  Traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 3,640-3,620 for potential targets around Rs 3,740 and Rs 3,800. The stop-loss for short positions should be placed above Rs 3,540.

TCS,2023-01-09T08:21:57+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS Q3 Earnings : Five things to watch out for,TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan during Q2 earnings said that the deal pipeline for Q3 looked comforting even as the company continues to remain vigilant of the macro situation.,"The IT sector earnings season for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 is set to begin today, starting with IT services major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). This will be followed by Infosys and HCLTech on January 12 and Wipro on January 13 – all in the same week.  While the overall growth in the sector is expected to be muted in Q3 due to the holiday season, high furloughs and macroeconomic challenges creating select pockets of volatility in client segments like BFSI, high tech and telecom etc.; TCS will likely be able to report a decent performance as compared to its peers, according to industry analysts. However, its exposure to weaker markets like the Europe and the UK is the highest among peers.  Commenting on the current quarter’s demand outlook, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said during Q2 earnings, “While the strength of our order book as well as the pipeline for Q3 is somewhat comforting, given the volatility, we remain very vigilant and are staying very close to our clients.”  Revenue Growth  Mega deals have already started to slow down and so has the nature of deal wins as clients are rethinking technology budgets amidst war, inflation, adverse regulatory changes and recessionary pressures in markets like the US, which account for nearly 60-65% of the revenue for the Indian IT services companies and Europe for another 20-25%, according to a recent ICRA report. Analysts are estimating TCS’ revenue for Q3 in constant currency (CC) terms to come in at around 1.5-1.9% touching $6,980 million or Rs. 56,922 crore.  TCS as compared to its peers has the highest exposure to the Europe and UK markets (currently the weakest against the US) at around 30% of its revenue, which might make it more vulnerable to the existing macro uncertainties.  Leading IT analyst Moshe Katri of Wedbush Securities, in his recent note said that TCS’ clients will remain cautious about CY23 IT budgets though there are no “indications of upcoming budget delays or elongated sale cycles.” Similar to September quarter, demand continues to exceed expectations, Katri said.  Demand may be in line with estimates  TCS’ management over the past couple of quarters remained bullish on maintaining deal win total contract value (TCV) in the range of $7-9 billion each quarter. In Q3 too, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe it could cross $9 billion plus even in TCV. Nirmal Bang’s head of research Girish Pai, however, expect that with no large deal win in Q3, the TCV could remain flattish on the account of “delays seen in decision making, especially on longer term deals.”  Wedbush Securities’ Katri said that TCS continues to remain focussed on expanding wallet share from existing clients by “aligning customer size/maturity with delivery, with the intention of building confidence while creating cross-selling transformational initiatives; TCS’ business transformational group manages large/mature clients.”  Vendor consolidation  With large and mega deals slowing down as well as multi-year transformation deals which were earlier being broken down among several service providers taking a back seat, vendor consolidation is the latest is trend that has emerged and likely to benefit Tier-I IT companies like TCS. These deals though will be comparatively of lower sizes as compared to the overall mega digital transformation deals, analysts told Moneycontrol.  “Vendor consolidation could become the theme for the coming quarters and would be a lever of growth for the company,” Pai said in his report.  Hence, the nature of deal wins, deal sizes and the sectors will be something to watch out for.  Impact of furloughs  Commentary on higher than expected furloughs will be a major theme to keep a track on; combined with slowdown in demand and decision making from certain sectors like mortgage, hi-tech, telecom, retail and manufacturing.  This will also reflect in the revenue growth numbers. “In CC terms, the revenue growth is likely to be at ~1.6% QoQ, implying ~20bp of currency headwinds. 3Q furloughs are expected to be higher than the earlier trend,” analysts at Motilal Oswal noted.  “The focus on furloughs will be high. The furlough impact was minimal in the last two years due to aggressive client spending and large deal rampup. We expect high furloughs in hi-tech and moderate in others,” said analysts at Kotak Institutional Securities.  Consequently, attrition rate is expected to start receding. Last quarter, TCS management said that attrition had likely started to bottom out and the company will now focus on improving utilisation rate. In fact, in Q2 employee addition stood at 9,840, its lowest net new addition in the last nine quarters.  Rupee depreciation to reap benefits  Overall EBIT margins or operating margins is expected to improve/ expand further by around 60-100 bps, according to analysts. According to Kotak’s analysts, this will be driven by depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar and other currencies, easing supplyside pressures, especially in India and general operational improvements.  Last quarter, TCS management had shared a guidance of 25% operating margin by Q4 exit. Any commentary on margins and changing trends will be important.

TCS,2022-12-19T10:19:12+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Top 10 trading ideas for next 3-4 weeks as selling spree gathers momentum,"The selling can be extended in the coming sessions with support at 18,100-18,000 levels, however, on the higher side, the index may face hurdles at 18,500-18,700 levels if it holds these supports","The market, after hitting fresh record highs, fell for the second straight week ended December 16 as central banks commentaries indicated that the rate hikes were not over yet. Growing recession fears also weighed on sentiment.  The Nifty50 lost more than 3 percent from its new record high, and corrected over a percent last week, forming bearish candle with long upper shadow on the weekly scale. Also, there was lower high formation for the second consecutive week, while on the monthly charts, the index has formed bearish piercing line pattern, indicating the sellers have more power over buyers.  The selling can be extended in the coming sessions with support at 18,100-18,000 levels, however, on the higher side, the index may face hurdles at 18,500-18,700 levels if it holds these supports, experts said.  &quot;Ideally looking at the price structure, the development does not augur well for the bulls. Only a follow through selling may lead to further weakness towards 18,130 - 18,000 - 17,900 in coming sessions. Even if this scenario pans out, we do not expect the correction to aggravate below the lower end of this support range,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.  He believes the higher degree up trend remains intact as long as the market manages to hold this. Since market was deeply overbought, this must consider as a running correction, he said.  On the flipside, he feels 18,450 - 18,600 are to be treated as immediate hurdles. &quot;If bulls have to regain their strength, 18450 needs to be surpassed with some authority.&quot;  Sameet Chavan advised traders to stay light for a while.

TCS,2022-12-12T13:30:43+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,"TCS faces lawsuit in the US alleging discriminatory hiring practices, violation of visa norms",The lawsuit alleges that TCS has a systematic pattern of discriminating against non-South Asian and non-Indian applicants and employees,"India's largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services has been sued by one of its former employees, who alleged that the IT firm discriminates against non-South Asian and non-Indian applicants and employees.  The lawsuit claims that TCS has a systematic pattern of discriminating against non-South Asian and non-Indian applicants and employees &quot;with respect to hiring, staffing, benching, termination, and promotion decisions,&quot; and that this policy is implemented top-down at the company.  This is not the first time that the Indian software company has been slapped with such a lawsuit. A similar lawsuit was filed in 2015, which the company won in 2018. At the time, the jury determined that TCS did not have a &quot;pattern or practice&quot; of discriminating against non-South Asian workers.  Shawn Katz, the complainant, worked for the company for nine years before being let go. This case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on December 7.  A class action lawsuit refers to people who have suffered the same or similar injury; however, Katz says the exact number of members of this proposed class action lawsuit is unknown and can be determined using TCS' records.  Katz claimed that despite meeting the qualifications for promotion for several years in a row, he was never promoted during his nine-year tenure at the company. He adds that he was recommended for promotion by both managers and client companies, but was moved to the bench and then fired. During his time on the bench, he claimed TCS failed to provide &quot;meaningful assistance.&quot;  The lawsuit he filed alleges that while only 12-13 percent of the US Information Technology industry is South Asian, approximately 70 percent of TCS’ US workforce is South Asian and “is primarily composed of non-citizens from India who are in the U.S. on work visas.”  It goes on to claim that this is grossly disproportionate and is the result of the company's employment discrimination against people who are not South Asian or Indian.  “TCS’s discrimination is systemic and ongoing, and impacts non-South Asians and non-Indians across the company, as well as applicants, who are disfavored in TCS’s hiring, staffing, promotion, and termination/retention decisions,” the complaint reads.  Over half of TCS’ business comes from the Americas.  Discrimination in hiring  According to the lawsuit, when TCS receives a contract from a US client, it must quickly fill open positions or risk losing the project, and TCS fills open US positions with both existing employees and new applicants. Existing employees include both local hires from the United States and those on work visas.  Existing TCS employees, as well as external applicants, must apply for open positions in the United States. The lawsuit goes on to say that once their time on a project is up, they are moved to the bench and must look for new positions within the company. They, too, must go through an application and interview process, just like any other external candidate.  “During this period, the employee is encouraged to apply directly to open positions on TCS’s internal portal and to work with TCS’s staffing group, the Resource Management Group (“RMG”), to locate open positions. If the employee remains on the bench for a prolonged period and cannot find a new position, TCS terminates his or her employment,” the lawsuit reads.  A hiring decision cannot be based on a person's race or national origin under US law, but the complaint goes on to say that both TCS talent acquisition and the third-party vendors the company uses have been directed to attract Indian candidates. As a result, it hires a disproportionately high percentage of South Asians and Indians, according to the lawsuit, and non-Indian and non-South Asian candidates are frequently passed over for open positions and not hired as a result of this discriminatory practice.  H-1B and L-1 visas  Those who wish to work on visas must be sponsored by the company for H-1B or L-1 non-immigrant work visas. While the H-1B visa is used to hire highly qualified workers for speciality jobs, the L-1 visa is used for intracompany transfers of those in managerial positions or with specialised knowledge. Each year, H-1B visas are limited, whereas L-1 visas are not.  The lawsuit contends that because the majority of TCS's workforce is located in India, the H-1B visa petitions that companies submit must specify an actual job at a specific location that the visa worker will fill if granted a visa.  “Each year, TCS seeks to maximize the number of visas it receives from the federal government. It does so by submitting visa petitions for more positions than actually exist in the U.S., allowing it to create an inventory of “visa ready” workers in India available to fill positions in the U.S. when they materialize,” it alleges. It goes on to add that the visa petitions falsely indicate that specific positions exist when they do not.  It goes on to say that TCS falsifies employee roles listed on H-1B and L-1A (managerial roles) visa applications, uses this to maximise visa approvals, and uses these people to perform low-level and non-managerial work in the US. The company also prioritises the placement of individuals on visas in US jobs, the lawsuit added.  The lawsuit provides an example of a company-wide directive in which RMG was instructed to use visa-ready employees onsite in the United States and maximise the use of every visa.  It goes on to allege that, in order to maximise visa holders' time on the visa, TCS &quot;disproportionately awards&quot; these employees higher appraisal scores and promotes them more frequently than non-Indian and non-South Asian employees.  Due to this practice, the majority of senior management in the US is predominantly South Asian and Indian, and many non-South Asians and non-Indians are never promoted during their time at TCS, the lawsuit said.  It adds that these non-Indian employees are often on the bench longer, and they are disproportionately terminated whereas South Asian visa employees from India are quickly allocated to new roles when their project ends.  “This results in non-South Asians and non-Indians being hired at lower rates, but also being fired at disproportionately higher rates.”  Relief sought  The relief sought includes directing TCS to adopt a valid and non-discriminatory method for hiring, promotion, termination, and other employment decisions; not to retaliate against individuals who complain of racial discrimination, awarding damages as well as front and back pay, and more.  Summons have been issued to TCS in this matter.  TCS told Moneycontrol that as per policy it cannot comment on subjudice matters.  The previous lawsuit that the company won had been brought by three former employees who claimed that they were discriminated against by being given fewer job opportunities and were fired because of their races and nationalities. It had made similar claims that non-South Asian employees were disproportionately benched and let go. In its verdict from 2018, the jury determined that TCS did not have a &quot;pattern or practice&quot; of discriminating against non-South Asian workers.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-faces-lawsuit-in-the-us-alleging-discriminatory-hiring-practices-violation-of-visa-norms-9691221.html

Sequential revenue growth was led by technology &amp;amp; services, life sciences &amp;amp; healthcare, manufacturing and retail &amp;amp; CPG.

Very importantly, the headwinds from the supply-side challenges are abating, so that set up well for the seasonally weak second half of the year, he said.  8) Workforce  TCS reported net addition of 9,840 employees during the quarter, taking the workforce to 6.16 lakh as on September 2022, with women making up 35.7 percent of the base.

With normalizing wage expectations and talent supply catching up across the industry, the company expects attrition to start to taper down in second half of FY23.  &quot;We believe the quarterly annualized attrition has peaked in Q2 and should see it taper down from this point, while compensation expectations of experienced professionals moderate,&quot; Milind Lakkad, Chief HR Officer said.  TCS' investments in capacity building and organic talent development have allowed it to substantially grow the business ahead of headcount addition this quarter, he added.  10) Dividend  The company said the board of directors on Monday declared a second interim dividend of Rs 8 per share.  The second interim dividend will be paid on November 7 to the equity shareholders, while the record date has been fixed as October 18 for determining the eligibility of shareholders for paying the dividend.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tcs-numbers-beat-on-all-counts-in-q2fy23-here-are-10-key-highlights-9305031.html

TCS,2022-10-07T12:15:59+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,TCS Q2 Results: Five things to watch out for ,"TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan stated last quarter that he expects the demand pipeline to remain strong in Q2, but that he will be wary of the macro-environment. Since then, a lot has changed.","The earnings season for the second quarter of the Indian IT sector begins next week. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the country's largest IT services company, will take the lead, announcing its results on October 10, followed by Wipro and HCLTech on October 12, and Infosys on October 13.  Most of them had a strong total contract value (TCV) and demand pipeline last quarter, but a lot is expected to be revealed this quarter. Especially, addressing several supply-side problems, such as not hiring new people who had been given offer letters, variable pay cuts and delays, client spending budgets going down, etc.  TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan stated last quarter that he expects the demand pipeline to remain strong in Q2, but that he will be wary of the macro-environment. Since then, a lot has changed.  We look at the top five things to keep an eye out for:  Revenue growth  Despite macroeconomic uncertainties in Europe and the United States, their key markets, and impending recessionary pressures, TCS is expected to post similar revenue growth to the previous quarter. Analysts expect revenue will increase by 1.2-1.7 percent in USD terms and 3.5-3.8 percent in constant currency terms, reaching an estimated Rs. 54,766 crore.  Cross currency headwinds  The depreciation and volatility of the rupee are one of the main worries in the industry right now. The value of the British pound and the Euro has dropped by nearly 10 percent since the end of the previous quarter, with the yen and the Australian dollar making matters worse. Volatility in currency can significantly impact Q2 performance as well as Q3FY23E.  “For tier-1 IT, we are building CC growth moderation to 13 percent for FY23E (~400bps negative cross currency impact) and 10 percent CC growth for FY24E (~1% negative cross currency impact) as compared to 18 percent growth registered in FY22,” analysts at HDFC Securities said in their report.  Demand remains resilient  Despite the macro challenges in Europe, TCS' contracting activity was strong, with some of the key deals including Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, Nokia, Boots, Zurich Insurance, and, according to media reports, a $2-billion BSNL deal.  However, Gopinathan's comments on client spending trends and demand expectations for the coming quarters will be worth noting. Especially since the retail industry and the BFSI sector - two of TCS's strongest segments - have been particularly hit and have experienced a slowdown in recent months.  Fresher hiring  The last quarter saw the IT sector's strong hiring narrative starting to crumble. TCS had already reported a slowdown in new hires in the first quarter of FY23, with around 14,000 compared to 24,000 in the same quarter last year and 35,209 in Q4FY22. The company then stated that it is now working to increase its utilisation rates.  However, despite offer letters being rolled out at major companies such as Wipro, Infosys, and Tech Mahindra, fresher onboarding has been delayed for months, and in some cases offers have been revoked, indicating an increasingly difficult business environment and an attempt to cut costs.  Meanwhile, variable pay was also either delayed or partially reduced for companies such as TCS, Wipro, and Infosys.  US visa crisis  Indians currently account for nearly 75 percent of all H-1B visas issued each year. The specialised non-immigrant visa allows employers to bring in technically skilled workers from other countries. Given the sheer volume of requests and the two years of uncertainty and travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, the visa approval timeline has now increased by over 400 days, and in some cases by 800 days.  This makes it difficult for IT companies to send employees to sites overseas. Analysts told Moneycontrol that this will keep subcontracting costs high in the near-term, at least until Q3.  Last quarter, TCS chief financial officer, Samir Seksaria, said, “Our subcontractor expenses currently are at 9.7% of our revenues, and have moved up from about 7% levels to where we are currently. And as Rajesh pointed out, we have proactively and strategically invested in creating a bench. Our current priorities are to stay focused on capturing the demand. And we have known how to balance on the subcontractor side. And as the need arises, we'll be able to realign it or balance it.”  &amp;nbsp;  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips of investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

TCS,2022-09-08T13:56:35+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,IT companies’ metaverse ambitions may slow as clients turn cautious,"There’s not much client spending on the metaverse and Web3 right now, though the technology provides immense possibilities and opportunities. ","Since the beginning of 2022, Indian information technology companies have actively explored and expanded their metaverse offerings to help clients navigate this new and pathbreaking technology.  The metaverse is touted as the successor to the mobile internet. It is a virtual, immersive environment where one can be present in a digital avatar and interact with the avatars of other people.  Infosys started the Metaverse Foundry, where it developed over 100 use-cases. Tech Mahindra said during its Q1 earnings announcement that it had 60 active metaverse projects in the pipeline.  Now, amid global uncertainties and fears of a recession in the US, client spending on futuristic technologies like the metaverse is likely to slow down and IT companies will need to tread this path cautiously, analysts and senior executives said.  “Some industries are better-positioned to immediately benefit from the metaverse – gaming, media and entertainment, travel and retail – whereas for a few other industries, the use-cases and roadmaps might not be immediately clear, and generally for organisations here, metaverse-related initiatives are part of discretionary spends,” Nachiket Deshpande, chief operating officer of Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Infotech, told Moneycontrol.  “We foresee some slowdown in these industries as they reallocate budgets to other technology projects that promise more immediate and tangible outcomes,” he added.  LTI’s clients in the metaverse space include global services companies, which are building advisory services or setting up retail metaverses for consumer companies.  Dynamic situation  Tech Mahindra, which has been strong with its emerging and futuristic technology segments, remains bullish on the opportunities in this segment but maintains that the macro situation remains dynamic.  “With appropriate measures in place like tackling inflationary pressure and managing hiring sprees, the Indian IT sector as a whole has managed to push against the fears of a recession here,” Rohit Anand, chief financial officer at Tech Mahindra said in response to Moneycontrol’s queries.  He said based on customer interactions, there hasn’t been any significant deviation from how the year started.  “But these are very dynamic scenarios. So, we have to continue to have those dialogue interventions… and continue to monitor it,” he said.  Any impact of an economic slowdown in the US will trickle down to India, but that will remain only for a short period, Anand said.  This comes as Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, which is a frontrunner in attempting to build a metaverse ecosystem, had to slow down its investment pace on such projects to overcome margin pressures.  What makes the metaverse big for IT service and consultancy companies is the interest and pace with which global giants Microsoft, Apple, and Google venture into this space and the rapid development of associated hardware and software products. Being in the exploratory phase, it is important for clients of IT companies to also be well-paced and benefit from first-mover advantages.  To cater to demand, IT companies had quickened hiring for metaverse-related skills like AR/VR, blockchain and AI over the past few quarters. According to a report from staffing firm Xpheno in March, there was an 8-10 percent increase in job openings in this space from January to March and hikes were as much as 80 percent.  Emails sent to Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies seeking comment on their metaverse plans didn’t elicit responses at the time of publication.  Reserved approach  According to Deshpande of LTI, most clients interested in the metaverse have either made their strategic investments and are moving forward with their planned implementation at full throttle or taking a more reserved approach.  “Their apprehensions are rooted in the fact that there are several unknowns and fewer points of reference at this time,” he said.  According to an LTI survey of 100 CXOs across North America, technology maturity and associated risks, user adoption, and the lack of skill sets were listed as the primary barriers. The survey also indicated that most CXOs seem to believe that mainstream adoption is three to five years away.  “It’s safe to say that we are in the early stages of metaverse technology and its implementation… However, with time, well-defined metrics around returns on investment, cost savings, and revenue growth will emerge and this will nudge more organisations to solidify their plans around the metaverse,” Deshpande said.  According to Ashutosh Sharma, head of research at Forrester Research India, the metaverse is still at an exploratory stage and clients are primarily enquiring about it and maybe carrying out a few pilot projects to figure out what works.  “At the same time, a lot of futuristic tech washing also happens, in the sense that they will claim that they’ve done this great thing using this new shiny tech, but you will discover it to be nothing but a tech-based solution dressed up as new,” he told Moneycontrol.  Sharma said large economies are a bit fragile at the moment due to soaring inflation and slowing growth and that’s a big risk in itself and will impact all service providers.  “But to cut the long story short, because of reduction in this discretionary spending, clients obviously would have cut down on some of these new trials and experimentation,” Sharma said.  No revenue impact  Sharma added that new as they are, futuristic technologies such as the metaverse and quantum computing contribute a very small fraction – less than even 1 percent – of revenue at IT companies. Even if spending goes down, immediate revenue flows won’t get impacted.  “This is something very new, very research-focussed at this moment. Companies try to use this tech as a new shiny object to attract clients. Reduced investments in them don't impact service providers and clients much,” he said.  Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at technology research firm ISG, said that not much client spending is actually happening on the metaverse and Web3 right now, though the technology has immense possibilities and opportunities in different industries.  “There are use-cases in banking and financial industry, travel, transportation, and, of course, entertainment, media and gaming. So there are different pockets of opportunities in this industry and everybody’s exploring. And when you call it the metaverse, it is not just one technology that’s getting implemented. There are building blocks in the metaverse, including non-fungible tokens and augmented reality,” he told Moneycontrol.  He said technologies that enable such an environment such as augmented reality and virtual reality have been around for some time. Although clients may not spend on the metaverse, they are working on implementing AR-VR-based technologies.  “And many of these Indian IT service providers already have clients that leverage AR-VR tech for industrial designing, digital engineering, or even in the workplace and collaboration phase,” Rai said.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/it-companies-metaverse-ambitions-may-slow-as-clients-turn-cautious-9148131.html

TCS,2022-08-25T10:41:37+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,"Inflated salaries, falling margins, slowing demand: Why Indian IT companies are cutting variable pay","High levels of attrition, increasing travel costs, and fears of a recession that’s affecting demand for IT services are putting pressure on margins of tech companies. ","It’s not often that three of India’s biggest software companies deliver bad news to employees in lockstep.  Last week was an exception. After reports that Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services had either slashed or deferred variable pay-outs for certain employees, Moneycontrol reported that Infosys was cutting variable pay to 70 percent.  TCS subsequently said variable pay for the first quarter had not been delayed and the entire amount would be paid as scheduled in the first or second month.  However, tech companies are under pressure after a banner year of clocking double-digit growth as enterprise clients migrated to the cloud and spent money on technology. But with high growth came an acute demand for talent and subsequently, high attrition levels.  Companies back-filled attrition by hiring a record number of freshers, but it takes months to train and deploy them in projects. As a result, they also hired experienced employees, turned to sub-contractors, and paid higher salaries to prevent employees from leaving.  Compressed margins  That was an expensive cocktail that worked in a robust demand scenario, with most employees working from home. But with offices opening up, travel costs rising, and demand looking uncertain, the cost tailwinds have tapered off, forcing companies to look at other ways to improve margins. Ergo, the cuts in variable pay.  “Margins have come off way higher than what analysts had forecast. The concern now is that with attrition going through the roof, companies had to pay much higher salaries, which impacted compensation discipline,” said a top executive in the sector who did not wish to be identified.  The executive said companies have been investing in retraining and upskilling in digital technologies, which is also taking costs up.  Elevated attrition has been a concern for a few quarters, with the rate at TCS the lowest among the IT giants at 19.7 percent for the first quarter of FY23. Attrition at Infosys climbed to 28.4 percent, while for Wipro, it was 23.3 percent.  Wipro CFO Jatin Dalal told analysts after announcing Q1FY23 results that attrition had one of the biggest impacts on the company’s cost structure. When attrition was being backfilled to replace someone with similar skills, capability and experience, companies had to pay a premium of 25 percent to 30 percent to lateral hires.  An industry executive said tech companies inflated salaries beyond what their compensation grid could afford to stay in the rat race for experienced digital talent, which compressed margins.  “Further, with travel restrictions easing and recessionary fears looming large, companies are walking the hallways of clients more often, leading to increased travel costs,” the person said.  While analysts had expected margins to be affected in the first quarter, they came in even lower than street forecasts. Wipro reported 15 percent compared to predicted margins of 16-17 percent. Infosys’ margin contracted to 20.1 percent sequentially from 21.6 percent, when expected margins were at 20.8 percent.  “Attrition is not cooling off anytime soon. There is a supply-side shortage and it takes time to deploy freshers. Companies are in a bind. A slowdown will do a world of good because it will give them time to fix the supply chain. Organisations have seen huge churn. Employees haven't met each other in the last two years,” a senior analyst told Moneycontrol.  The analyst said companies have to draw the line somewhere on profitability as efficiency had taken a backseat.  Deferred spending  However, the industry executive said the alignment of variable pay with individual and company performance is good.  “It brings greater discipline to performance management. Having said that, this cannot be uniformly applied to all levels of the workforce as the ability of those at junior levels to impact larger company performance is limited,” the executive said.  While analysts said client spending is expected to be stable for the next few quarters, there are concerns over deferments in discretionary spends or longer spending cycles in some pockets.  According to HFS Research CEO Phil Fersht, there is definitely a slowdown in demand for IT services as enterprise leaders hold fire on spending decisions due to negative economic forecasts.  “IT services firms have focused wage increases on the junior and mid-layers to stem attrition and are less concerned about senior leaders jumping ship in this economy. The leading providers are preparing for margin squeezes and a slowdown,” he said.  On the possible levers to contain this, Fersht said hiring must be slowed down, key talent retained and bonuses aligned to maintain profit margins.  Omkar Tanksale, a research analyst at Axis Securities, told Moneycontrol that it is critical that companies listen to commentary from the client side.  “There might have been a delay in the demand side or a delay in discretionary spending from the clients that may be slowing down the revenue growth momentum in the short term. However, the long-term story still remains intact. In the short term, margins are surely under stress and they are likely to control it by cutting down the mid- to higher-level variable pays and have to get the employee pyramid right to sustain the margin side,” he said.  The decisions of companies to reduce variable pay for the first quarter primarily impacts mid- and senior-level employees and may not lead to a significant uptick in attrition, but companies could lose top performers, said Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO of CIEL HR services.  Differential treatment  He said the top performers who have aspirations could be disappointed if they don’t get their bonuses and their promotions are deferred or hikes are reduced because of cost optimisation.  Mishra said it's not easy to give differential treatment to top performers in large organisations. Policies have to be applied uniformly because other employees would be disappointed and may leave, thinking the employer isn’t being fair.  “The leadership team has got a difficult job at hand to convince or to keep applying the glue which will hold their top talent. If they lose average talent or below-average talent, they may not lose their sleep, but they will lose their sleep if top talent is leaving them and that is not very unlikely,” he said.  Top talent could be headhunted by other companies that continue to hire, he said.  Last week, Wipro said in an email to employees that variable pay will not be paid to those in B and C (mid-manager level) and above, while junior employees in Bands A and B would receive 70 percent of their variable pay.  The company said there has been continued pressure on operating margins and attributed it to “inefficiency in our talent supply chain, project margins, and our investments in talent, technology, and solutions during the quarter.”  Infosys said the average variable pay-out at an organisation level is 70 percent and an employee’s final pay-out will depend on their pay grade and their unit or department. In its email to employees, Infosys said investments in hiring and compensation revisions have impacted margins in the immediate term.  TCS said on August 23 that it has not delayed variable pay to employees for the first quarter and that it was normal to give it in the first or second month.  An email sent to employees in specific grades, a copy of which Moneycontrol has reviewed, said the performance bonus was yet to be finalised.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/inflated-salaries-falling-margins-slowing-demand-why-indian-it-companies-are-cutting-variable-pay-9083751.html
TCS,2022-08-23T16:42:37+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,"TCS says no delay in variable payout process, 100% being paid out in Q1","A TCS statement said that variable pay is paid either in month one or two, and that there is no delay in this process. ","IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) clarified on June 23 that it has not delayed variable pay to employees for Q1 and that it was normal to give it in the first or second month.  “We have come across completely incorrect reports on our compensation. Variable pay is either paid in month one or month 2 as per the normal process and there is no delay in this process. 100% VA is being paid for Q1,” the statement by TCS said.  An email sent to employees in specific grades, a copy of which Moneycontrol has seen, had said that the performance bonus was yet to be finalised for these grades of employees.  “The performance bonus for Q1 FY23 is yet to be finalized for C3A, C3B, C4, and equivalent grades. This will be paid along with August 2022 payroll to eligible associates,” the email sent by TCS to employees read. The email did not have details regarding why the performance bonus had not been finalised at the time.  When Moneycontrol had previously reached out to TCS for comment, the company had said: “All our compensation and bonus cycles are as per plan.”  TCS’ peers Wipro and Infosys have both slashed variable pay for the first quarter, as Moneycontrol earlier reported.  Wipro will not be giving variable pay to those in Band C and above (people at mid-manager level and above), while junior employees will receive 70 percent of their variable payout. While Wipro did not comment on the quantum of variable payout, the company said in a statement that as per its plan, salary hikes will be rolled out from September 1 and it has completed the first cycle of its quarterly promotional cycle from July.  Infosys, on the other hand, has said that the average variable payout at an organisation level will be 70 percent, but the final payout varies for employees in different pay grades and different units.

TCS,2022-08-20T10:34:02+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,"After Wipro, TCS delays June quarter variable pay of select employees","The employees were to receive their variable pay along with July’s salary, which will has be paid with August salary","India’s biggest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has delayed the variable pay for senior employees for the first quarter of FY23 , a few days after rival Wipro made a similar decision as the sector braces for a slowdown.  The variable pay has been delayed for certain grades— C3A, C3B, C4 and equivalent— of employees for the June quarter.  “This will be paid along with August 2022 payroll to eligible associates,” an email, reviewed by by Moneycontrol, read. Moneycontrol has learnt that the variable pay has been paid with July’s salary to junior employees.  In a statement, TCS said its compensation and bonus cycles were as per plan.  For the quarter ending June 30, 2022, TCS had a headcount of 6,06,331 and added 14,136 associates.  TCS’s operating margin in Q1 was 23.1 percent, down from 25.5 percent from the year-ago quarter, which it attributed primarily to salary increases that were rolled out from April 1.  “The other is the continuing demand environment and the attrition environment that is leading to the increased operating costs on the employee side,” TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said in an earnings call. Attrition would probably take a few more months to come down, he said.  “Till then the margin pressures will continue but we hope to sequentially improve from where we are, given that we have taken a hit on that completely,” he said.  Variable pay, part of an employee’s cost to company, is linked to either the employee’s performance or that of the firm. While variable pay ranges between 10-15 percent for junior employees, it can be up to 20-30 percent of the compensation for mid to senior level employees.  Earlier this week, Moneycontrol reported that Wipro was holding back variable payouts to mid and senior-level employees for the April-June quarter. Junior-level employees, too, would only receive 70 percent of their variable pay for the quarter.  Wipro’s note to its employees blamed the move on the pressure on operating margins, which, in turn, was attributed to &quot;inefficiency in our talent supply chain, project margins, and our investments in talent, technology, and solutions during the quarter, which will continue as these are directed toward long-term value building.&quot;  Wipro, whose operating margin came in at 15 percent, told employees that the company was measured on three financial metrics for variable pay—revenue, order booking, and margins, and was not paying out the variable pay due to the hit it took on margins.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/after-wipro-tcs-delays-june-quarter-variable-pay-of-select-employees-9060131.html

The momentum oscillator RSI (relative strength index 14) reading in a higher high higher bottom formation from 30 levels has reached near its overbought zone which is 70 levels and the slope of the oscillator has started to move lower like an inverted scallop pattern on the daily time frame.

TCS,2022-07-28T19:45:02+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,New client addition slows down at top 4 Indian IT firms,"TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL added 60 clients in the $1 million plus revenue band in Q1FY23, down from 91 clients added in the same band in Q1FY22  ","Net new client addition across revenue bands for the top four Indian IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Technologies — remained tepid in the first quarter of FY23 ended June 30, 2022, with the exception of the $1 million plus revenue category.  Sequentially, client addition in Q1FY23 in the $1 million plus revenue band grew to 60 from just 42 clients added in Q4FY22 across the four firms. However, it dropped significantly on a year-on-year basis, when compared to the 91 clients added in the same quarter last fiscal, according to data accessed from CareEdge Research. In a YoY comparison, client addition dropped across revenue bands.  “The slowdown in client addition is an impact of higher base effect on account of a sudden post-pandemic ramp-up in Q1FY22. However, client additions gathered pace in Q1FY23 vs. Q4FY22 as Q4s are generally weak from a seasonality perspective. The growth has mostly been broad-based across verticals. BFSI continues to have the largest share and is the fastest growing segment,” Tushar Shah, Co-CEO, CareEdge Advisory &amp;amp; Research, said.  During Q1FY23, the mix of high-value client additions demonstrated a very strong trend. For instance, in $10 million plus bucket, 21 clients were added in Q1FY23, compared to 22 clients added in the whole of FY21, which was marred by the Covid-19 pandemic.    From a mix perspective, the $10 million plus and above bands comprised more than a third of all client additions in Q1FY23. This trend is similar to that seen in full year of FY22, where a third of the client additions were deals greater than $10 million.  “However, for very large deals with size greater than $100 million, there is indeed a slow-down seen in Q1FY23. Compared to 7 – 10% of overall client additions being in the greater than $100 million bucket during FY22, in Q1FY23, very large clients constituted only around 5% of all client additions in $1 million and above bucket,” Shah added.  Slowing deal pipeline   While most of these companies said that deal wins have been in line with expectations and that they have a visibility for Q2, there has been caution about what happens beyond that, especially in calendar year 2024, given ongoing macro uncertainties, fear of impending recession and cross-currency headwinds.  During the earnings announcement for Q1FY23, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said that, “Projects that are currently going on, the pipeline conversion, all of that indicates a very steady demand environment. We are also constantly polling to see whether there are any early indications of softening and as of now there is nothing into the middle of the year.”   “On deal wins, it seems to kind of be cooling off and seems to indicate probably that there is a demand issue developing. When you discuss issues regarding this with the management, they generally say that as of now, things are okay,” Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, had said in an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/new-client-addition-slows-down-at-top-4-indian-it-firms-8908611.html

In fact, some clients are asking us to advance execution of certain projects in calendar year 2022 as they have the budgets to do so,” Sudhir Chaturvedi, President Sales and Executive Board Member, LTI said at the earnings press conference for quarter ended June 30, 2022 (Q1FY23).  Chaturvedi added, “We are not seeing any immediate impact in terms of project cancellations or deferments on account of the macro situation, but we are sensing a level of caution in the client environment especially when it comes to spending in calendar year 2023. We are remaining close to our clients to understand their plans for the same. We are focussed on the short-term accelerations we are seeing in demand for most clients. This puts us in a favourable position for a strong Q2.”  This also reiterates the concerns of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), as CEO Rajesh Gopinathan highlighted during the company’s earnings call last week. Gopinathan said that the company will continue to remain vigilant despite a strong deal pipeline expected in the upcoming quarters.  LTI too remains optimistic of its deal wins in the second and third quarter of FY23.  Deal wins  LTI witnessed a net new deal TCV of $79 million in Q1FY23, which remains flat as in Q4FY22, where the company reported $80 million worth of new deal TCV. The IT services company also won a large deal together with Mindtree with a global travel technology company based in Europe.  “LTI had a 2.9 percent QoQ constant currency growth, YoY was 26.6 percent. We had a seasonal pass through in Q4 and our revenue adjusted for that seasonal pass through of license revenue. It would have been 5.1 percent in constant currency terms. We closed 4 large deals with a net new TCV of $79 million this quarter, two of which are with Fortune 500 clients and this is spread across verticals and geography perspective,” Chaturvedi said.  “Our current large deal pipeline continues to remain same as Q4 and we remain positive as we have a large deal pipeline of over $2 billion at this point. We have added 29 new logos across verticals this quarter, the highest we have added in past nine quarters. Four of them are Fortune 500 companies, taking the total to 77,” he added.  Across verticals, geographies and service lines, BFSI alone is about 47 percent of LTI’s total revenue, growing at CAGR of 19 percent over the last three years. LTI’s insurance vertical remained soft for the last two years, but is now showing strong signs of growth - growing 18 percent YoY.  “North America and Europe remain strong geographies for us. Despite macro concerns in Europe, we are growing at 32 percent YoY,” he said.  Hiring plans remain on track  Interestingly, LTI’s attrition rate went down by around 20 bps to 23.8 percent on an LTM basis in Q1 as compared to 24 percent in Q4FY22. This is the first time it started stabilising after a steady increase over the past six-seven quarters.  LTI added over 2,100 freshers in Q1, and remains on track to add a total of at least 6,500 freshers this fiscal.  “Hiring continues to work well for us. Our net headcount addition has been 2,100 in Q1, in line with our previous quarter as we continue to build for strong Q2. We remain on track with our fresher hiring plans of adding at least 6,500 freshers in FY23,” Nachiket Deshpande, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Board Member, LTI said.  LTI reported consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 633.50 crore for Q1, up by 27.64 percent from Rs 496.30 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.  On a sequential basis, profit for the remained nearly flat compared to Rs 637 crore in the March quarter.  Consolidated revenue from operations grew 30.62 percent YoY to Rs 4,522.8 crore, up from Rs 3,462.5 crore in the year-ago period.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/clients-will-relook-2023-tech-budgets-we-remain-cautious-lti-management-8829941.html

Likewise, Relationship Incubation Group has also had above 5 percent growth and Enterprise Group also grew more than 17 percent YoY.”  “The organisation has come together very smoothly.

It added nine new clients to the $100 mn-plus band YoY and 19 clients to the $50 mn-plus band.","With continued uncertainty due to fears of a recession and uncertainty in Europe, Tata Consultancy Services CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said while pipeline velocity and deal closures continue to be strong, the company is vigilant due to macro-level uncertainties.  TCS kicked off the IT results for the quarter on July 8, with profit increasing by 5% year-on-year. In terms of deal wins, the IT services major saw a decline from last quarter -- from $11.3 billion to $8.2 billion. It added nine new clients to the $100 mn-plus band YoY and 19 clients to the $50 mn-plus band.  TCS had a total contract value (TCV) of $8.2 billion in Q1FY22. Gopinathan added that the company is seeing steady demand based on client discussions, and the same is reflected in their deal pipeline and closures.  In terms of customer addition, TCS said it added customers across all revenue bands. Its $100-mn-plus customer base grew by nine on a year-on-year basis going to 59 clients for the quarter. Growth, he said, has been broad-based across geographies and sectors.  The CEO added that demand for technology continues to be robust, and is similar to the themes that have driven them in the recent past — cloud transition, as well as investments in customer experience and other operating model transformation initiatives. These initiatives, he added, are both on the growth side as well as on the transformation side.  “Projects that are currently going on, the pipeline conversions, all of that indicates a very steady demand environment. We are also constantly polling to see whether there are any early indications of softening and as of now there is nothing into the middle of the year,” he said.  Customers are focussed, he said, adding they don’t see a footprint of the recession on the demand.  “The pipeline build is quite strong and the nature of deals are also remaining fairly strong. We are now running at about 1.2 times book-to-bill which is above our long-term average. On an immediate basis, the demand continues to be pretty strong,” he said.  TCS overhauled its organisation structure, and as a result of it, the CEO said they don’t just expect an impact on revenue but also expect to see greater vibrancy on the bottom end of the client pyramid as we see the progression from lower to upper revenue backgrounds. He added that the new structure needs time to start delivering.  From an Indian business perspective, Gopinathan said it is volatile, but the corporate sector is doing relatively well.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-q1fy23-result-we-remain-vigilant-due-to-macro-level-uncertainties-says-ceo-8800381.html

","IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services saw attrition for the Q1FY23 come in at 19.7 percent on a last twelve-month basis, which is the highest in the last six quarters. It is up from 17.4 percent in Q4FY22. TCS added 14,136 employees in the first quarter of FY23, taking its headcount to over 6 lakh. On a year-on-year basis, its net addition numbers were down from 24,000 in Q1FY22 to 14,000 in Q1FY23.  TCS had announced a hiring target of 40,000 for FY23 at the end of FY22. TCS CFO Samir Seksaria said the company is on track to hire 40,000 people this fiscal, and is not its changing hiring target. The company's leadership said hiring is positioned to contract or expand depending on demand.  Commenting on the attrition numbers, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said attrition in this quarter should be also considered from a seasonality perspective as junior level employees go for studies or other areas, but said that it has not yet started to dip.  &quot;On an absolute basis, it is continuing to increase, though on a percentage basis, it is starting to flatten and we expect that that may continue into part of Q2 also. It will be H2 when we will start seeing some amount of more meaningful moderation of it. That's our immediate short-term view on attrition but from a medium long term, we think that both the supply side as well as the demand side is easing up - in terms of talent coming from outside of the immediate industry system and that should play into moderation,&quot; he said.  Chief HR officer Milind Lakkad said in a statement the company has invested in strategic talent development initiatives and the linking of learning to career development has “energized our workforce.”  He added that employees have received salary increases of 5-8 percent, and top performers have got bigger hikes. “Continued hiring momentum resulted in a milestone quarter, with the employee strength crossing the 600,000 mark,” he said.  The company added that about 20 percent of the workforce now works out of its offices.  TCS Q1FY23 Results | Click here for LIVE updates  CFO Samir Seksaria also said it was a challenging quarter as the operating margin reflected the impact of the annual salary increase, “the elevated cost of managing the talent churn” and gradually normalising travel expenses.  TCS had hired over 1 lakh freshers in FY22 and in the last quarter — Q4FY22 — the company had added 35,209 employees.  Attrition has continued to be a concern for the company in what is an industry-wide problem, with attrition going up from 8.6 percent in Q1FY22, 11.9 percent in Q2, 15.3 percent in Q3, and 17.4 percent in Q4, and 19.7 percent now in Q1FY23.  However, it is important to note that despite elevated attrition levels, TCS’ was the lowest among its peers last year.  In a note, Kotak Institutional Equities had said attrition levels of over 20 percent were expected across IT services companies “as they deal with talent crunch in a buoyant demand environment.” Reliance Securities said though attrition would remain elevated, “it has peaked out for now” and expects moderation in attrition in IT services in the second half of FY23.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-attrition-rises-19-7-in-q1fy23-14136-employees-added-during-the-quarter-8799721.html

TCS,2022-06-30T16:23:53+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"IT Q1 Preview | Strong revenue growth likely, margin pressure seen with high attrition rates",Kotak expects Infosys to maintain full year revenue growth guidance at 12-14 percent in constant currency terms and the EBIT margin band at 21-23 percent.,"Information technology (IT) companies will kick off the first-quarter earnings season in July amid expectations they will post strong revenue growth, offset by pressure on profit margins exerted by higher. wage costs. IT companies including Infosys and HCL Technologies are unlikely to change their full-year guidance despite concerns of a recession in the US and Europe, analysts said.  Major IT companies typically announce their earnings for the three months ended June in the first fortnight of July, with Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services leading the pack.  The earnings season follows a tumultuous quarter marked by worries over the Russia-Ukraine war, accelerating inflation and tightening of interest rates by global central banks to cool it, supply-chain disruptions, and tumbling financial markets.  IT stocks have fallen the most among sectors, with the Nifty IT index correcting 29 percent from its high in January. Higher valuations and rising fears of an economic slowdown, even recession, in the US and Europe, the biggest markets for IT companies, weighed on the sector.  On a sequential basis, IT companies are expected to post diverging results because of sequential factors although they are expected to report strong year-on-year growth, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report.  Infosys will lead the way with revenue growth of 4.5 percent on a sequential basis, followed by TCS at 3.6 percent, the securities firm said. Seasonal weakness will dampen growth at Tech Mahindra, Wipro, and HCL Technologies, which may report 2.4-2.8 percent constant currency growth in revenue quarter-on-quarter, it said.  Among mid-tier companies, Mphasis is expected to report a weak quarter because of a likely decline in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO business linked to mortgage origination and refinancing. L&amp;amp;T Infotech may report modest 3.1 percent growth due to lower pass-through revenue while Mindtree will lead the way.  Before this year's correction in the Nifty IT index, the sector had had a healthy run-up since the outbreak of the pandemic, benefiting from the increasing adoption of digital media by students and salaried individuals cooped up indoors because of lockdowns.  &quot;As the probability of a recession in the US has increased, there are renewed concerns in some cases around a slowdown in discretionary IT spends and this, coupled with lofty valuations, has resulted in a downward adjustment in stock prices,&quot; Siddharth Mehta, founder, and investment chief at Bay Capital said.  Dhananjay Sinha, Managing Director, Head Strategist, and Economist - Equity Research at JM Financial Institutional Securities said the valuation of IT companies is now closer to fair value after the recent correction in their stock prices. Feedback from companies suggests that their revenue outlook is intact so far.  &quot;There may be some downside due to an eventual recession. But it may be temporary as we see structural tailwinds for IT spending by US companies over the longer horizon. A potential recession or an economic slowdown could ease the wage cost pressure for Indian IT companies over time,&quot; he said.  Margin pressure  Tech companies have already been grappling with pressure on their operating profit margins exerted by rising employee costs in the face of growing attrition. Kotak said the margin pressure seems to have bottomed out.  &quot;Companies are incurring high talent retention costs (retention bonus, out-of-cycle wage revision etc.). The challenge exists in India as well as onsite. This pressure will seep into margins; we forecast 70-400 bps YoY decline in EBIT margin across the coverage universe,&quot; Kotak said. EBIT is short for earnings before interest and tax.  On a sequential basis, the securities firm sees headwinds in the form of wage revision for Infosys, TCS and Tech Mahindra, an increase in travel costs across all companies and visa costs for many and a decline in utilization as companies crank up hiring of fresh graduates.  Optically, Kotak feels the rupee's depreciation against US dollar may seem positive, but cross-currency headwinds have ensured only a marginal tailwind in the quarter.  The US dollar appreciated 5 percent, 6.6 percent and 1.7 percent against the euro, British pound and the Australian dollar, respectively, while the rupee depreciated 4 percent against the US dollar.  &quot;Earnings before interest and tax has bottomed out in our view and will improve for most in the subsequent quarters as most pressure points are already absorbed, while efficiencies in the form of a pyramid, subcontracting cost rationalization and utilization will kick in later. The recent wave of rupee depreciation could also help,&quot; said Kotak. the June and September quarters would represent the peak of margin pressure.  Guidance  Kotak expects Infosys to maintain full-year revenue growth guidance at 12-14 percent in constant currency terms and the EBIT margin band at 21-23 percent.  HCL Technologies is also likely to retain revenue growth and margin guidance of 12-14 percent and 18-20 percent, respectively while Wipro could guide for 2.5-4.5 percent revenue growth on a sequential basis (1-3 percent organic), Kotak said.  Key things to watch out for  Investors will closely follow new deal wins, companies' commentary on demand, attrition, and pricing.  Kotak expects companies to report robust new deal wins. On attrition, the firm said it is likely to be more than 20 percent across companies as they deal with a talent crunch in a buoyant demand environment.

G&amp;amp;T initiatives are likely to offer TCS huge growth opportunities given its robust contextual knowledge and full service model. TCS has a proven track record of gaining market share in the fragmented IT industry across cycles.

Margin levers such operating leverage, pyramid balancing, improved realisations and currency tailwinds are expected to offset the margin headwinds to a large extent in FY2023.

TCS,2022-05-30T09:57:29+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Top 10 trading ideas from experts for next 3-4 weeks as bulls lock horns with bears,"Experts largely hope the index to remain in a broad range of 15,700-16,400 levels but if it decisively surpasses the upper band of the range, then there could be a possibility of the index moving towards 16,600-16,800 levels in the coming days","The market managed to settle the week ended May 27 with half-a-percent gains which witnessed a negative mood in the first three days, followed by a sharp recovery in the next two sessions of the week. The Nifty50 strongly defended the crucial 16,000 mark throughout last week and closed the near-critical hurdle of 16,400 levels.  Experts largely hope the index to remain in a broad range of 15,700-16,400 levels but if it decisively surpasses the upper band of the range, then there could be a possibility of the index moving towards 16,600-16,800 levels in the coming days. Further, if the market breadth turns stronger and global cues remain positive, then there could be further rally in the market, experts said.  The Nifty50 rallied 1.13 percent or 182 points to 16,352 on Friday and during the week, it gained half a percent, but the broader space underperformed frontliners as the Nifty Midcap 100 index fell 0.77 percent and Smallcap 100 index declined 3.4 percent during the week.  &quot;In last three consecutive weeks, our markets made several attempts towards 15,900–15,700, but fortunately, despite unfavourable global environment, our market showed tremendous resilience at lower levels. In fact, with the last two days of smart recovery, our market seems to have weathered the storm, at least for the time being,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  Now, we are back to the higher end of the recent range i.e. 16,400 and it would be interesting to see whether the Nifty surpasses it or not. In our sense, it’s a matter of time and we would see the Nifty traversing this level to test 16,600–16,800 in current week, he said.  Despite all this, he feels we are still not completely out of the woods yet, because globally there is yet to stabilize things. Hence, he advises that traders not get complacent and should keep assessing situation on a regular basis.  As far as immediate supports are concerned, he said 16,200 followed by 16,000 should provide cushion on any intra-week weakness.  Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on the May 27 closing prices:  Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative &amp;amp; Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities  VIP Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 559.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 510 | Target: Rs 630 | Return: 13 percent  Primary trend of stock is positive as it is trading above its 100 and 200 weeks moving averages. During the recent correction, stock price has taken support at the upward sloping trendline on the weekly chart.  Stock price has formed Bullish Hammer candle stick pattern on the weekly chart. It has formed triple bottom around Rs 515 levels on the daily chart suggesting strong support around that levels.  Mastek: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,448 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,350 | Target: Rs 2,650 | Return: 8 percent  Stock price has formed double bottom on the daily line chart. Short term trend of the stock turned bullish as it closed above its 5 days EMA (exponential moving average). Primary trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its 100 and 200 weeks EMA.  It has corrected nearly 30 percent from the recent high and reached near support on the weekly chart. RSI (relative strength index) and MFI (money flow index) Oscillator has started sloping upwards, suggesting higher probability of bullish trend reversal in the stock price in the coming days.    DCB Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 82.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 78 | Target: Rs 92 | Return: 11 percent  Short term trend of the stock is bullish as it is trading above its 5 and 20 weeks EMA. Stock price is on the verge of breaking out from the symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart.  RSI oscillator has bounced back from the 30 odd levels and started rising, suggesting higher possibility of bullish trend reversal in stock price in the coming days.  Bank Nifty has broken out from the downward sloping trendline and we expect bullishness to spill over in the midcap banking stocks in the days to come.  Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,123.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,045 | Target: Rs 1,250 | Return: 11 percent  The IT space has witnessed a decent correction from their highs and Tech Mahindra, too, has corrected sharply along with its peers. However, prices have reached its important support where we can observe a harmonic pattern called AB=CD where two alternate moves are equal in length. This coincides around the support end of a Falling Channel and also the ‘RSI Smoothened oscillator has given a positive crossover from its oversold zone.  The upmove in last couple of sessions from its support indicates probability of a pullback move in the short term.  Hence, traders should look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 1,125-1,115 for potential targets of Rs 1,190 and Rs 1,250 in the near term. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below Rs 1,045.    Ambuja Cements: Buy | LTP: Rs 366.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 357 | Target: Rs 379 | Return: 3.5 percent  In the recent market corrective phase, this stock has shown a relative outperformance and has seen a time-wise correction rather than any price correction. From the lows of March 8, the recent upmove seems to be a five wave ‘Impulsive’ upmove in which prices are trading within ‘wave 4’.  The stock has formed a triangle in this consolidation and looking at the price volumes structure and the RSI oscillator, we expect a breakout in the stock soon which would be the fifth wave of this impulse.  Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 365-362 for potential targets of Rs 372 and Rs 379 in the near term. The stop-loss for long positions can be placed below Rs 357.    Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,096.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 | Target: Rs 1,200 | Return: 9.5 percent  The stock has formed a bullish reversal formation on a daily chart. It has formed a “Gravestone Doji” after hitting the important support level based on the Fibonacci retracement.  Also it’s a volume-based price reversal formation, which should favour bulls heavily in the near term. It's a buy at current levels and more on dips around Rs 1,060 with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,020. On the higher side, it would face major resistance at Rs 1,150 and at Rs 1,250.    BHEL: Buy | LTP: Rs 51.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 47 | Target: Rs 59 | Return: 15 percent  It has formed a double bottom in the critical support zone. The last several times, it has relied on Rs 44-45 and has bounced back in a hurry.  To validate the formation, the stock must definitely cross the level of Rs 59, which is far from the current level.  Over the past two days, the stock has been rapidly reversing back to Rs 47-48, indicating that the stock is poised to move towards Rs 59 in the near term. We should be buyers at the current level and fall further around Rs 48 with a final stop-loss at Rs 47.    TCS: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,261.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,100 | Target: Rs 3,600 | Return: 10.4 percent  The stock has completed a corrective pattern on Rs 3,154 levels, however, a sharp recovery is missing due to weakness in the entire sector. As the stock completed a major corrective pattern, investors should be buyers at current levels (Rs 3,265).  It is giving a decent risk-reward ratio for medium-term investors. On the upside, it has the biggest hurdles at Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,600. Keep stop-loss at Rs 3,100 on a closing basis.  Ajit Mishra, VP-Research at Religare Broking  Ambuja Cements: Buy | LTP: Rs 366.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 348 | Target: Rs 390 | Return: 6.5 percent  We’re seeing a mixed trend within the cement space and Ambuja Cements is currently seeing consolidation. It’s hovering in a tight range while holding firmly above the support zone of the major moving averages (100,200 EMA).  The chart pattern indicates a strong directional move soon. We thus recommend accumulating within Rs 362-366 levels.    Hero MotoCorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,719.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600 | Target: Rs 2,900 | Return: 7 percent  The auto pack has been performing well within the sectoral pack and Hero MotoCorp is performing in line with the trend. It has witnessed a fresh breakout from a declining broadening formation on the daily chart and is likely to maintain the prevailing momentum.  We recommend initiating fresh longs within Rs 2,690-2,710 levels.  Havells India June Futures: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,182.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,220 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 7 percent  Havells has been trading with corrective bias since December 2021 and gradually drifting lower. After retesting the trend line hurdle, it was hovering in a narrow range around the major moving averages on the daily chart and witnessed a fresh breakdown of late.  We thus recommend creating shorts within Rs 1,185-1,195 zone.

TCS,2022-05-13T06:15:00+05:30,Vidnyan Sawant,"Hot Stocks | Bet on Gujarat Gas, Avanti Feeds, TCS for 10-19% return in short term. Here's why",The RSI indicator plotted on the weekly charts is moving upward from oversold region and it is sustaining above 40 mark with the formation of higher low indicating positive momentum of Avanti Feeds.,"Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research, at GEPL Capital  Since the last six weeks, the Nifty50 has been making lower top lower bottom formation and through the previous four weeks it has sustained below its 20-week SMA (simple moving average) at 17,185, which shows bearish sentiment of the index.  On the daily charts, the index has faced strong resistance at 16,500 levels since the last five days, indicating negative undertone of the market.  On the indicator front, the RSI (relative strength index) plotted on the weekly charts is sustaining below 40 mark which shows negative momentum.  The Nifty has immediate resistance placed at 16,500 and 17,000, followed by 17,251 levels. The downside support for the index is placed at 15,671 followed by 15,450 levels.  We feel that the Nifty is in bearish mode. If the Nifty breaches 15,671 levels then it will move towards 15,450 levels in coming days. Our bearish view will be negated if it sustains above 17,251.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  Gujarat Gas: Buy | LTP: Rs 566.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 522 | Target: Rs 626 | Return: 10 percent  Gujarat Gas is trading at 9 weeks' high and forming higher top higher bottom formation on the weekly charts. The stock is strongly outperformed the broader market.  We witnessed a volume pick up at every rise in a stock price which shows bullish undertone of the stock. On the daily charts, the stock has given a breakout of horizontal channel pattern and sustained above 50 days SMA (Rs 517) indicating positive strength of the stock.  On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on the daily time frame has sustained above the 60 mark with a higher top higher bottom pattern, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to move at higher levels towards Rs 594 post which we might see a move towards Rs 626 levels. We recommend a stop-loss of Rs 522 on daily closing basis.    TCS: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,408.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350 | Target: Rs 3,835 | Return: 13 percent  TCS is sustaining near the major support zone of Rs 3,380 – 3,350 levels with the formation of Doji candlestick pattern. Also the stock is forming CIP pattern (Change in Polarity) at Rs 3,380 levels indicating bottom formation process is going on. The stock is offering favourable risk reward ratio at this juncture.  On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on the daily chart is giving positive diversion at oversold region.  Going ahead, we might see the prices move higher towards Rs 3,676 mark. If the prices manage to sustain above Rs 3,676 mark we might see further up move towards Rs 3,835 level. We recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 3,350 on daily closing basis.    Avanti Feeds: Buy | LTP: Rs 456.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 410 | Target: Rs 542 | Return: 19 percent  Avanti Feeds is taking strong support at Rs 400 levels with the formation of Double Bottom pattern on the weekly charts.

The RSI indicator plotted on the weekly charts is moving upward from oversold region and it is sustaining above 40 mark with the formation of higher low indicating positive momentum of the stock.  We expect the stock to move higher towards Rs 500. And if it manages to cross above Rs 500 then eventually it will move towards Rs 542 levels. One should maintain a strict stop-loss of Rs 410 on daily closing basis for this trade.

TCS,2022-05-10T06:57:50+05:30,Vinay Rajani,"Hot Stocks | TCS, Power Mech Projects, NOCIL can give up to 10% return in short term, here's why","NOCIL is placed above 20, 50 and 200-day EMAs, which indicate a bullish trend in all time frames. Indicators and oscillators like RSI, DMI and MACD are showing strength in the current up move","From the swing high of 18,114 on April 4, the Nifty has fallen almost 2,000 points to 16,142. The Nifty has been declining for the last four weeks and this week, too, has started on a bearish note.  The Nifty is trading below its 20, 50, 100 and 200- day simple moving averages (DMAs), which indicates that the positional trend has turned bearish.  Bearish trends also have pullbacks and short-covering rallies after some oversold setup on the short-term charts. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has reached 33 level, which is near the oversold zone.  The 14-day RSI for Nifty smallcap and midcap indices reached 23 and 31 levels, respectively. The Nifty smallcap index has reached the crucial support level, derived from the previous swing low of 9,286, registered on February 24 this year. Disparity Index from 20- DMA also indicates short-term oversold setup.  Catching a falling knife is always risky in the equity markets, especially when bears are dominating the trend.  Considering the recent fall and short-term oversold condition, going short doesn’t provide favourable risk-reward ratio.  In such a scenario, traders should exit the prevailing short positions and wait for the pullback to short it again around the resistance area.  The Nifty has got strong resistance at its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) placed at 16,850, around which traders can again initiate fresh shorts with 17,200 stop-loss.  We are of the view that markets could bounce back towards 16,850 in the short term. However, the positional trend is bearish and traders should adopt “sell-on-rallies” approach. The positional support for the Nifty is at 15,800.  Here are three buy calls for the next two-three weeks:  TCS: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,445 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,300 | Target: Rs 3,680 | Return: 7 percent  The stock has reached the demand zone derived from previous swing highs and lows on the weekly charts. The daily Stochastic oscillator is in the oversold zone below 20 levels.  The RSI on the daily chart seems to be forming a positive divergence, which indicates the probability of a short-term pullback. The stock is placed above all important moving averages, indicating a bullish trend on all time frames.    Power Mech Projects: Buy | LTP: Rs 985.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 930 | Target: Rs 1,060 | Return: 7.6 percent  The stock has broken out from the downward sloping trend line on the weekly charts. It has been finding support at its 20 and 50-day EMA.  The stock has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily chart. Indicators and oscillators like RSI, directional movement index (DMI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) are pointing to strength in the current up move.    NOCIL: Buy | LTP: Rs 245.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 227 | Target: Rs 270 | Return: 10 percent  On May 9, the stock rose more than 5 percent, with a significant jump in volumes. The stock is on the verge of a breakout from bullish Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the weekly chart.  Any level above Rs 248 will confirm the neckline breakout. The stock is placed above 20, 50 and 200-day EMAs, which indicate a bullish trend on all time frames. Indicators and oscillators like RSI, DMI and MACD have been showing strength in the current up move.

USD6,681mn). Rupee revenue grew by 3.5% QoQ to INR 5,05,910mn (KRChoksey est. INR 5,02,487Mn). Reported operating margin contracted by 7bps to 25.0% led by supply side pressures of backfilling of attrition, increased sub-contracting costs, wage interventions to retain talent and discretionary costs. Reported Net profit grew by 1.6% QoQ to INR 99,260mn (KRChoksey est. INR 99,889mn) with margin of 19.6%. In this quarter, TCS has registered a highest ever deal bookings of USD 11.3bn (two mega deal wins &amp;gt;USD 1Bn in Q4). TCS is well poised to benefit from strong demand and growing digital transformation opportunities, although salary inflation and potential slowdown in Europe remain near-term concerns. As supply side pressures ease off in FY23, there is scope for margin expansion led by reducing sub-contracting costs, improved pricing, pyramid optimization, best-in-class supply side engine and leverage from growth. The company declared a dividend of INR 22 per share. Our target price of INR 4,256 is based on 31.3x Mar-24E EPS with EPS CAGR of 14.6% over FY22-24E.  Outlook TCS is currently trading at a valuation with a P/E multiple of 30.8x/27.1x on FY23E/FY24E earnings. We expect strong deal momentum across verticals, ease in travel restrictions and continued investments in newer technologies such as product &amp;amp; platform which will help maintain the growth momentum in medium term future and hence we are assigning a P/E multiple of 31.3x to the FY24 estimated EPS of ~INR 136 to arrive at a target price of INR 4,256 per share, an upside of 15.4% over the CMP. Accordingly, we reiterate an “ACCUMULATE” rating to the stock.  More Info At 17:30 Tata Consultancy Services was quoting at Rs 3,691.45, down Rs 4.95, or 0.13 percent.

Revenue growth was broad-based across verticals with communications, BFSI and retail leading the growth. TCV was strong at US$11.3bn (all-time high) growing 49% QoQ and 23% YoY- partly aided by two mega-deals of ~US$1 bn each. Company benefited on margins from reduction in travel costs in Q4FY22 (down from 0.94% of revenue to 0.50%). Apart from travel costs, every cost item moved up for TCS during the quarter. We believe these costs will further increase as companies may plan to return workers to offices (travel, facility, communications). Though TCS has better-than-peers’ supply-side management, upcoming salary hikes, retention costs and wage inflation will add to the headwinds on margins. We would like to highlight that employee addition remained strong (+35k) in Q4 with average of 23k in past three quarters, which still showcases strength in demand. Attrition rate on ltm basis increased further to 17.4%, an increase of 210 bps QoQ and 1,020 bps YoY. Demand remains democratic in nature, but its fulfilment will come at a cost, which will further dampen the earnings momentum. Talent shortage will continue even as the IT industry has added a record number of freshers. High cost to backfill attrition and retain talent will leak into margins across companies. Talent constraint exists not only offshore, but onsite as well. Tailwinds will be backended &amp;amp; headwinds will be upfront.  Outlook We are forecasting revenue growth of 11.2%/10.1% and margins of 24.8%/25% for FY23E/FY24E respectively. TCS has better-than-peers’ supply-side management, breadth of capabilities and deep domain capabilities, but the stock is trading at 28.3x on FY24EPS with PEG of 2.4x – this leaves limited room for upside. We reiterate our HOLD rating on account of slowing earning growth and elevated PEG ratios with a fair value of Rs3,519 based on 27x FY24E earnings. Our estimates remain intact.

The strength in demand is reinforced by – 1) record high broad-based TCV ($11.3 Bn, 49% QoQ, +23% YoY) comprising of two large deals (7-10-year duration), 2) management commentary that deal TCV will continue trending upwards at ~$8+ bn (vs $6-7 Bn pre-covid) and 3) record headcount addition of ~35K, 6%QoQ, +21% YoY. Margins are expected to remain under pressure in the near term due to high manpower costs and return of travel and facility costs. We expect supply pressures to ease in H2FY23, as quarterly attrition cools off. Tech budgets remain priority despite high inflationary environment and we expect impact of inflation to be seen on tech spending with a lag in FY24.

Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here's what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after the Q4 earnings:  Prabhudas Lilladher  We remain structurally positive on TCS given its (1) strong growth momentum on a high base, (2) best-in-class supply-side metrics with industry-leading margin profile, and (3) strong client mining abilities further enhanced by client-centric new organisational structure.  We cut our EPS estimates by 1.5 percent/0.8 percent for FY23/24 led by a cut in margin estimates.  We arrive at a DCF-based target price of Rs 4,221 (earlier target price of Rs 4360; implied earnings target multiple of 31x on FY24 EPS).  TCS is currently trading at 31x/27x on FY23/24 EPS of 119.6/136.6 with revenue/EPS CAGR of 12.5 percent/16.2 percent over FY22-24E.  Motilal Oswal  Given TCS’ size, capabilities, and portfolio stretch, it is rightly positioned to leverage the anticipated industry growth.  TCS has consistently maintained its market leadership position and shown best-in-class execution. This renders the company with ample room to maintain its industry-leading margin and demonstrate superior return ratios.  We maintain our positive stance on TCS, given its strong growth outlook. Our target price of Rs 4,240 implies 30x FY24E EPS, with a 15 percent upside potential. We maintain our 'buy' rating.  Sharekhan  TCS is expected to remain at forefront of participating in clients’ growth and transformation journeys, given its strong digital competencies, robust contextual understanding of clients’ operation, mature product and platform portfolio and solid execution.  Record high deal win TCVs, good client addition and broad-based growth across industries provide strong double-digit revenue growth visibility for FY2023.  We expect the company’s US Dollar revenues and earnings to clock a 12 percent/14 percent CAGR over FY2022-24. We maintain a 'buy' on TCS with an unchanged price target of Rs 4,600.  JPMorgan  Research firm has maintained neutral rating on TCS with a target at Rs 3,900 per share.  The stock outperformed Nifty IT by 9 percent YTD partly led by buyback support. The stock trades at 31x 1 year forward PE, 11/8 percent premium to Infosys/Accenture and don’t see further upside triggers.  Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley has kept the equal-weight rating with a target at Rs 3,900 per share.  There was a volatile macro climate but resilient demand and even with good Q4 order intake, the revenue upgrades are unlikely.  The macro conditions are trickier than they were last year and faces downside risks from ongoing supply-side challenge.  Jefferies  Brokerage house maintained hold rating with a target at Rs 3,925 per share. The stock is at a 10 percent premium to Infosys despite having 3 percent lower earnings growth.  The results were ahead of estimates, recovery in stressed verticals driving growth.  Jefferies has raised the FY23-24 estimates by 1-2 percent and expect margin around the 25 percent levels over FY23-24.  Nomura  The broking firm Nomura has kept the 'neutral' rating on the stock and raised target to Rs 3,930 from Rs 3,890 per share.  It expect EBIT margin to drop 40 bps YoY to 24.9 percent in FY23 as Q4 results modestly beat consensus on revenues.  Nomura increases FY23-24 EPS estimates by 1 percent.  CLSA  CLSA has maintained outperform call on the stock and raised target price to Rs 4,000 from RS 3,850 per share.  There was a strong hiring and orderbook, but margin volatility is an overhang.  The company has reported healthy 3.2 percent QoQ constant currency revenue growth, orderbook is 40 percent above run-rate of the past four quarters but we trim our FY23/FY24 EPS forecasts by 1.6 percent/0.4 percent, said CLSA.  However, improved revenue visibility is a near-term comfort, it added.  At 9:18am, Tata Consultancy Services was quoting at Rs 3,691.40, down Rs 5.00, or 0.14 percent on the BSE.

TCS,2022-04-04T15:39:35+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Midcap IT firms likely to maintain growth outperformance over Tier-1 in Q4FY22,"Management commentary on large deals pipeline and deal closures would be important to gauge confidence on growth continuity and better predictability, says Emkay Global.","Emkay Global expects the revenue growth momentum of IT companies will remain healthy in the last quarter of FY22, with midcap firms continuing to outperform the Tier-1 (large-caps) despite seasonality factors.  After significant outperformance in first half of FY22, the Nifty IT index return came in line with the broader markets in the second half.  The Nifty IT index was up 3.7 percent in second half of FY22, outperforming Nifty50 that fell 0.87 percent in the same period, while the Nifty IT index fell 6 percent during the March quarter, largely due to profit taking on high valuations concerns, against 0.6 percent gains reported by Nifty50.  &quot;We expect companies in our coverage universe to report steady revenue growth on the back of a secular demand environment, healthy ACV (annual contract value) deal wins and M&amp;amp;A activities, although seasonal factors should weigh on sequential growth,&quot; says Emkay Global.  The brokerage further says the demand environment continues to remain broadbased, driven by strong demand for digital, cloud, data analytics, 5G, IoT, cybersecurity and AI.  Emkay expects revenue growth of 0.9-4.9 percent QoQ in dollar terms and 1.2-5.2 percent growth in constant currency terms for Tier-1 companies. &quot;Midcap companies should continue to outperform, with growth in the range of 3.5-7.5 percent QoQ in dollar terms and 3.6-7.6 percent growth in constant currency terms for the quarter ended March 2022.&quot;  Click Here To Read All Earnings Related News  Guidance  On the guidance front, the research house expects Infosys to guide for 12-15 percent YoY revenue growth in constant currency terms, with 22-24 percent EBIT margin for FY23.  For FY22, the country's second largest IT services company expects revenue growth in the range of 19.5 percent-20 percent for FY22 and margin at 22-24 percent.  According to Emkay, HCL Technologies is likely to guide for double-digit revenue growth, while lowering EBIT margin guidance range to 18-20 percent for FY23. Wipro, which generally gives quarterly guidance, is expected to guide for 2-4 percent revenue growth on sequential basis in constant currency terms for Q1FY23, says the brokerage.  During the quarter ended March 2022, IT stocks corrected due to high valuations concerns and overall market correction, but in full year FY22, midcap IT stocks outperformed largecaps.  In Q4FY22, Coforge, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, L&amp;amp;T Infotech, HCL Technologies, Mindtree and L&amp;amp;T Technology Services corrected 9-24 percent, while Infosys and TCS ended the quarter on a flat note.  During the year, Mindtree beat every stock in the Nifty IT index, rising 106 percent. L&amp;amp;T Technology and Mphasis gained more than 90 percent each, while the rest gained in the range of 18-52 percent.  &quot;Midcap companies are likely to maintain growth outperformance over Tier-1 companies due to consistent execution, a better level playing field with shrinking deal sizes, client mining, and steady deal wins and pipeline,&quot; says Emkay Global.  Higher employee churn and a shortage of skilled resources remain the key challenges in the short term, it feels.  Deal Intake  Emkay expects the deal intake to remain healthy across companies in Q4, driven by an uptick in smaller deals as deal tenures have become shorter due to clients' urgency to execute digital transformation projects in a short span rather than signing large, longer-tenure deals which follow lengthy due diligence and legal processes.  Management commentary on large deals pipeline and deal closures would be important to gauge confidence on growth continuity and better predictability, says the brokerage.  Most of experts believe IT sector is going to be outperformer for coming years and will continue to trade at premium valuations.  Margin Performance  Except for Coforge, Mphasis, and eClerx Services, Emkay feels EBIT margin is expected to remain flat to lower sequentially due to higher backfilling costs amid a tight labour market, increase in travel and other discretionary costs with the easing of travel restrictions and back to office trends.  &quot;HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra, Mindtree, Persistent Systems and Firstsource Solutions are expected to report relatively higher sequential declines in margins, with the rest reporting largely flat margins,&quot; says the brokerage.  Key things to watch out for  FY23 revenue growth and margin guidance; CY22 IT budget; management commentary on any impact on tech spending from higher energy prices, inflation and potential economic slowdown; and demand trends in key verticals such as BFSI, Retail, Manufacturing and Communications will be key things to watch out for, says Emkay.  In addition, other key monitorable things would be deal intake/pipeline in Q4; pricing environment considering high inflation and tight labour markets; margin outlook; and supply-side challenges and attrition.

When asked about the readiness of TCS to roll-out 5G network for telecom customers, Bhadada said, “TCS can stitch it today. TCS is doing it today. So it’s not about whether TCS is ready or not. TCS is ready. What we are working for in India is India-specific stack,” Bhadada said.  BSNL is working with TCS and C-DoT to roll-out an indigenously developed 5G-enabled 4G network.

The government is gearing up to hold 5G auctions before June so that 5G networks can also be launched by August 15. “In my view 5G has at least 3 more years of cycle left before it starts, I mean India is in the very tail end of it. If you really look at it in the western markets everybody is in the middle of it. By 2023 or 2024 I feel all the 5G roll outs will be complete,” Bhadada said.  He said that it will take another 3-4 years for full exploitation of the 5G network and then the process for 6G networks will start.  “6G is interesting, but I feel 5G will take five years for exploitation. I mean as I said 2-3 years for completing the rollouts and another 3-4 years for exploitation. 6G even in other markets is in my view at least four years away from any commercial right,” he said.

The downside support for the index is placed at 15,834 (August 2021 Low) followed by 15,450 level.  The index is in a bounce back mode. We feel that the Nifty will touch 16,959-17,027 levels in the coming days. On the contrary, if it breaches 15,834 levels on the downside then it will move further down till 15,671 and 15,450 levels.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  Infosys: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,826 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,650 | Target: Rs 2,230 | Return: 22 percent  Infosys made a life-time high at Rs 1,953 levels in January 2022 and after that it has corrected till Rs 1,665 levels which is a multiple touch point level.

On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on the daily time frame has sustained around the 60 mark with a higher top higher bottom pattern, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to move higher towards the previous swing high of Rs 1,950 post which we might see a move towards Rs 2,230 levels. We recommend a stop-loss of Rs 1,650 on daily closing basis.    GNFC: Buy | LTP: Rs 630.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 570 | Target: Rs 812 | Return: 29 percent  GNFC is maintaining Higher Top Higher Bottom formation on all the time frames like Daily, Weekly &amp;amp; Monthly charts and outperformed the market with sustaining at fresh life time highs.

The IT sector, which was the darling of the bull market throughout most of 2020 and 2021, has seen the worst start to a calendar year since 2008, reflecting the intensity of the selloff.  The Nifty IT has fallen more than 11 percent in 2022, so far, as investors turn pessimistic over the sustainability of the sector’s rich valuations amid the possibility of a sharp increase in interest rates at home and abroad.  The sector has been clubbed by investors in the larger technology basket, which is in a bear grip for the past three months as investors bet on the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates at least four times this year alone amid multi-decade consumer price inflation.  Foreign portfolio investors net sold software stocks worth Rs 16,000 crore in January, taking overall selling in the past five months to close to Rs 34,500 crore, data available on National Securities Depository Limited shows.  The sell-off also comes amid emerging doubts over the sector’s fundamentals, with sceptics pointing to lowering deal sizes in the industry, growing pressure on margins and continued challenges in retaining talent.    Among the challenges, the risk of higher attrition rates across the Indian IT sector has been the biggest concern for investors.  Nearly every major listed IT company reported a worsening of the attrition rate in the quarter ended December, which in some cases jumped to as high as 20-25 percent.  Brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities, however, argued that the surge in attrition rate is a leading indicator of the tsunami of potential deals that these companies could see over the next five years.    “A nuanced take based on our experience is that industry-wide high attrition should not be a turn-off; it is, from a forecasting perspective, a lead indicator of an extremely strong demand environment,” Edelweiss Securities said in a recent note.  The research firm expects the challenges to dissipate in the coming quarters, as the new workforce that has been hired in large numbers over the past year and a half completes training and contributes to numbers.  “Furthermore, our several interactions with global technologists experts convincingly back up our observation—that cloud sales of hyperscalers can lead to three times services revenues spread over the next five, six years,” Edelweiss said.  Industry body National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) in 2021 predicted that IT services sector revenues could hit $300-$350 billion by 2025.  Edelweiss Securities said NASSCOM’s projection is the most pessimistic case for the sector considering the demand environment.  “We see this (correction) as an opportunity. Short-term corrections like these are an opportunity to buy from a short-term and long-term point of view,” said Vikash Khemani, founder at Carnelian Asset Advisors.  His optimism is borne out by data, too, given that over the past 13 years such episodes of more than 10 percent correction in the Nifty IT index, have only seen the index go on to give average returns of more than 110 percent before the next steep correction.

Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran ranks as the top CEO in India and 25th globally in the Brand Finance Brand Guardianship Index 2022.,"Two of the top three most valuable IT services brands across the globe are Indian. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys have beaten IBM to take the number two and three spots, respectively, in the annual report by Brand Finance, the world’s leading brand valuation firm.  Accenture has retained the title of the world’s most valuable and strongest IT services brand for the fourth consecutive year.  In addition to measuring overall brand value, Brand Finance also evaluates the relative strength of brands, based on factors such as marketing investment, customer familiarity, staff satisfaction, and corporate reputation. Alongside revenue forecasts, brand strength is a crucial driver of brand value.  In the Brand Finance Global 500 2022 report, Infosys has been recognized as the fastest-growing IT services brand in the world and among the Top 25 fastest-growing brands across sectors globally.  Year-on-year brand value grew by 52% to $12.8 billion, with Infosys rising 56 places in the Brand Finance Global 500 2022 ranking.  The company said in a statement that growth in brand value and strength is &quot;the outcome of the company’s concerted efforts to build a deeply client-relevant brand that also serves as a trusted engine of change.&quot;  Putting it in a pandemic context, David Haigh, chairman and CEO, Brand Finance, said,  &quot;While the COVID-19 pandemic spurred the necessity of a digital transition across the globe, Infosys stepped up to the challenge, resulting in its monumental 80% leap in brand value over the course of the past two years.&quot;  The company has continued to invest and nurture market-relevant brands to help clients accelerate their digital transformation journeys. It's also focussed on nurturing a well-differentiated employer brand marked &quot;with significant learning opportunities, growth trajectories and purposeful career paths for employees.&quot;  Those of us who have caught a bit of tennis recently would have spotted Infosys court-side. The company continues its partnerships with the ATP, Roland Garros and the Australian Open. It has made strategic investments in several digital and brand partnerships. This includes Infosys’ Signature Marketing Partnership with the Madison Square Garden – also making Infosys the Official Digital Innovation Partner of key MSG properties including the New York Knicks, New York Rangers and the Madison Square Garden Arena.  While Infosys took a monumental leap forward, TCS took yet another steady step closer to the very top as it ranked as the second most valuable IT brand in the world.  This latest feather in TCS's cap comes a day after the Government of India announced N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons, as a Padma Bhushan awardee.  Chandrasekaran also ranks as the top CEO in India and stands at 25th position globally in the Brand Finance Brand Guardianship Index 2022 of world’s top 250 CEOs.  Chandrasekaran is a TCS lifer. He began his career in 1987 at the IT major and went on to become its CEO from 2009 until 2016 when he was appointed as the Chairman of Tata Sons.  The latest Brand Finance report finds that TCS’s brand value has increased by $1.844 billion which is a 12.5% increase in comparison to last year. Its brand value in 2022 stands at $16.8 billion.  The Tata Group company initiated a brand refresh in 2021 and launched a new brand statement ‘Building on Belief' as it repositioned TCS from a B2B to a &quot;B2B2C&quot; player.  TCS is also one of the most recognized Indian brands globally in large part owing to its sponsorships and partnerships in sports like running and more recently racing, including The New York City Marathon, London Marathon and Toronto Marathon and the Jaguar TCS racing team.  In the Global 500  Looking at particular sub-regions within Asia-Pacific, Tata Group is the most valuable brand in South Asia and India’s only entry in the top 100, with a brand value of US$23.9 billion, following a 12% increase from the previous year.  The report states that the performance of Tata Group exceeded expectations in 2021, thanks to a number of new acquisitions and partnerships and as key group companies – from Tata Consultancy Services to Tata Steel – witnessed major growth. The market capitalisation of Tata Group’s 20 listed subsidiaries has exceeded that of 70 listed central public sector undertakings (CPSUs) in India.  More from the 2022 Brand Finance Global 500 report  Apple holds on to the world’s most valuable brand title with record valuation at more than US$355 billion, followed by Amazon and Google.  New entrant TikTok named world’s fastest-growing brand, up 215%, leading global revolution in media consumption.  Tech remains the most valuable industry, while second-ranked retail crosses the US$1 trillion mark following 46% brand value growth during COVID-19 pandemic.  Development of COVID-19 vaccines sees pharma named the fastest-growing industry, while the tourism sector remains below pre-pandemic valuation.  US and China continue to dominate, claiming 2/3 of brand value in ranking, while India sees fastest-growth over the course of pandemic among top nations, up 42%.  WeChat was named the world’s strongest brand for the second consecutive year with the top score of 93.3 out of 100 and elite AAA+ rating.  Microsoft’s Satya Nadella comes out top in Brand Finance Brand Guardianship Index 2022 of world’s top 250 CEOs.  In pharma, new entrant to the ranking AstraZeneca secured the title of the sector’s fastest-growing, with a remarkable 77% rise in brand value to US$5.6 billion, followed by Pfizer as the second fastest-growing at 58%, pushing its brand value to US$6.3 billion.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/storyboard18-tcs-infosys-in-top-3-most-valuable-it-services-brands-globally-beat-big-blue-7986471.html

Revenue grew 3.9%/15.4% QoQ/YoY in CC terms. EBITM declined by ~60bps QoQ to 25%, due to an increase in compensation costs, higher subcontracting expenses and discretionary non-manpower costs.

TCS,2022-01-13T09:45:44+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"What should investors do with TCS post Q3 numbers, buyback announcement: Buy, sell or hold?","Its consolidated revenue during the September-December period stood at Rs 48,885 crore, up 16.4 percent from the year-ago quarter","Tata Consultancy Services shares gained more than 2 percent in early trade on January 13, a day after India’s largest IT services company reported better numbers for the quarter ended December and announced an interim dividend and share buyback.  TCS said consolidated net profit increased 12.3 percent to Rs 9,769 crore from Rs 8,701 crore a year earlier. Profit was Rs 9,624 crore in the three months ended September. Consolidated revenue rose 16.4 percent to Rs 48,885 crore, led by strong deal wins and an increase in digital spending by companies.  Also Read - TCS Q3 results | Here are the key takeaways  The board of the company announced a buyback of shares valued at Rs 18,000 crore at Rs 4,500 apiece. TCS also declared an interim dividend of Rs 7 per share with a record date of January 7 and payment on February 7.  TCS shares gained 0.7 percent to Rs 3,885.75 on the BSE at 9:47 am local time after climbing to Rs 3,944.40.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages say about the stock and the company after the quarterly earnings:  Citi  Citi retained its ‘sell’ call on the stock with a target of Rs 3,580 as Q3 earnings were largely in line with expectations.  The total contract value of $7.6 billion was largely in line with the average of the previous four quarters.  For FY22-24, the EPS estimates changed by 0-1 percent. It found consensus margin assumption of 26 percent for FY23 to be high, while buyback may support in the near term.  Goldman Sachs  The broking house reiterated its ‘buy’ call on the stock with a target at Rs 4,747 as the company has the lowest attrition in the industry. TCS has the best capability to fulfil and capture growth potential, and robust demand is expected to continue in CY22 as well.  Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley has kept its ‘overweight’ call on the stock with a target of Rs 4,400 after the company surprised with revenue growth after a gap of two quarters. The Q3 revenue performance was better than the higher end of the street’s expectations. The management’s commentary supported expectations of strong growth in CY22. While the margin has disappointed, it is not a concern.  UBS  UBS has kept its ‘neutral’ call on the stock with a target of Rs 4,180.  Revenue was a beat, but the margin miss offsets any earnings upsides.  Motilal Oswal  Given TCS’ size, capabilities and portfolio stretch, it is rightly positioned to leverage the anticipated growth.  TCS has consistently maintained its market leadership position and shown best-in-class execution. This renders the company with ample room to maintain its industry-leading margin and demonstrate superior return ratios.  Motilal Oswal maintained its positive stance on TCS, given its strong growth outlook. Its target price of Rs 4,250 implies 30x FY24E EPS, with a 10 percent upside potential. Maintain ‘buy.’  Prabhudas Lilladher  TCS can easily sustain ~26 percent EBIT margin in FY23 despite the return of discretionary expenses and supply-side cost pressures. As supply-side pressures ease off in FY23, there is scope for margin expansion, led by reducing sub-contracting costs, improved pricing, pyramid optimisation, best-in-class supply-side engine and leverage from revenue growth.  It increased TCS’ EPS estimates by ~1.6%/2 percent for FY23/24, led by marginal increase in revenue growth and EBIT margin. It projected revenue growth of 16.3/14/11.4 percent in dollar terms for FY22/23/24E, respectively. We arrive at a discounted cash flow-based target price of Rs 4,468 (implied earnings target multiple of 32x on FY24 EPS).

TCS,2022-01-04T10:33:25+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,IT Q3 Preview | Healthy topline likely despite seasonal factor; midcaps may outperform largecaps,Healthy deal flows are likely to drive revenue growth even though December is generally a lean month due to year-end holidays,"Technology companies will kick off the December quarter earnings season next week with Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Wipro releasing their numbers. Experts expect revenue growth to be healthy despite the seasonality factor, driven by a robust demand outlook amid digitalisation. Midcap IT companies are likely to continue to outperform large-cap firms.  The Nifty IT index surged 60 percent in 2021 and gained 10.5 percent in the quarter ended December, outperforming other sectors as well as the Nifty 50, which fell 1.5 percent during the quarter due to high valuations and US Federal Reserve tightening.  Tech Mahindra was the biggest gainer among IT stocks in the December quarter, rising 30 percent, followed by L&amp;amp;T Infotech with a 27 percent gain. Mindtree, Wipro, Infosys and Coforge rallied 12-14 percent, while HCL Technologies was up 3 percent. TCS underperformed, falling 1 percent.  Top line performance  Analysts expect the third quarter (October-December) of FY22 to be another strong one for IT companies as large-caps (tier-1) are expected to report 2.5-4.5 percent revenue growth in constant currency terms, and midcap IT firms (tier-II) are set to clock 3.5-6.5 percent top line growth in constant currency terms, driven by healthy deal flows. Dollar revenue growth is likely to be 2-3.3 percent quarter-on-quarter. December is generally a lean month due to Christmas and New Year holidays.  “Despite the impact of furloughs, we forecast extremely strong revenue growth led by high discretionary and continuing transformation spends,” Kotak Institutional Equities said. “Wipro, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies will likely deliver around 4.5 percent growth in constant currency. We forecast Infosys' growth at 3.7 percent and TCS to deliver modest 2.6 percent QoQ growth.”  The brokerage said mid-tier companies may deliver revenue growth rate of 5-6 percent in constant currency, with YoY growth of 20-34 percent.  Companies will have cross-currency headwinds of 20-90 basis points due to the dollar’s appreciation against the pound, the euro and the Australian dollar, it said. One basis point is equal to one-hundredth of a percent.  Elara Capital expects tier-1 IT service companies to report organic growth in the range of 2.5-4 percent QoQ in constant currency.  “Average revenue growth in USD terms is expected to be 3.1 percent QoQ, dragged by negative cross-currency impact of around 65 bp QoQ. Growth momentum has been robust despite Q3 seasonality and strong base (more than 4 percent CQGR over the past four quarters),” Elara said. CQGR refers to compounded quarterly growth rate.  The growth momentum is supported by healthy deal flows (small and mid-sized), a better annual contract value-to-total contract value trajectory, and continued offshore- and volume-led growth, the brokerage said.  In the midcap space, “Mindtree, L&amp;amp;T Infotech and Persistent Systems are expected to lead growth within the pack and would post mid-single-digit to high single-digit sequential growth,” said Elara.  Deal wins  Deal wins are expected to remain healthy, but reported total contract values (TCV) may not reflect the strength in demand fully.  “We expect deal intake to remain healthy across companies in Q3,” said Emkay Global.  However, TCVs may remain steady as deal tenures have become shorter with clients wanting digital transformation projects to be implemented in a short span rather than signing large, longer-tenure deals, which follow lengthy due diligence and legal processes, Emkay said.  The deal pipeline is robust across the IT sector, driven by an uptick in contracts related to cloud adoption, digital transformation and customer experience transformation, the brokerage added.  Accenture’s recent results created buoyancy among IT companies, indicating that growth in tech will continue and remain upwards.  FY22 guidance  Infosys and L&amp;amp;T Technology Services are expected to revise their full-year constant currency revenue growth guidance upwards.  “We expect Infosys to tighten the guidance band to 17-17.5 percent from 16.5-17.5 percent earlier,” said Kotak.  Infosys started the year with a revenue growth guidance of 12-14 percent. HCL Technologies estimated double-digit revenue growth.  “We expect HCL Technologies to deliver revenue growth of around 12 percent in constant currency for FY22. L&amp;amp;T Technology raised the revenue growth guidance after September quarter results to 19-20 percent. We believe it may further up the guidance to 20-21 percent,” Kotak said.  Emkay expects Infosys to revise its FY22 revenue growth guidance to 17.5-18 percent year-on-year, while IDBI Capital expects Infosys to up the guidance to 18-19 percent.  According to both brokerages, Wipro may project a 2-4 percent QoQ revenue growth in constant currency for the fourth quarter of FY22.  Operating performance  The earnings before interest and tax margin is expected to be steady on a sequential basis and lower on a year-on-year basis due to the high base in the year-ago quarter. The attrition rate is expected to remain on the higher side.  There were many benefits in December such as the deferment of wage revision (except for TCS), negligible travel costs and a pullback in discretionary spending. Companies have rolled out wage increases twice since the December 2020 quarter, which reflects in YoY decline in margins.  The margin picture will be steady on a sequential basis with primary headwinds emanating from the backfilling of attrition with lateral recruitment, which costs 25-30 percent more, a decline in utilisation rate as companies load up on fresher hiring, and a creeping rise in discretionary costs, Kotak said.  “These will be offset to some extent through further tightening of operations,” said Kotak, adding all companies will report a YoY decline in EBIT margins.  On the bottom line, Motilal Oswal expects tier-I tech companies to deliver growth of about 11 percent YoY and about 6 percent QoQ.  “Tier-II players are expected to report a robust PAT growth (around 23 percent YoY and 6 percent QoQ), driven by strong revenue growth, but partially offset by lower EBIT margins,” it said.  Key factors  Deal wins and the deals pipeline, outlook, attrition and hiring trends, commentary on CY22 IT budgets, demand environment in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), manufacturing, retail, and communications, the pricing environment and digital trends are the key factors to watch out for.  Stocks to bet  Emkay’s pecking order is Infosys, TCS, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra among tier-1 companies and Route Mobile, Mphasis, Firstsource Solutions, e-Clerx Services, Persistent Systems and Birlasoft in midcaps.  Motilal Oswal prefers tier-I companies, given their relative valuation attractiveness and tendency to narrow down the valuation differential over time.  “Among tier-I players, we like Infosys, HCL Technologies, and TCS. In tier-II, we prefer L&amp;amp;T Technology Services and Zen Technologies.  Elara Capital prefers Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech among tier-1 firms and Mphasis among mid-tier IT companies. IDBI Capital prefers Infosys and Wipro among large-caps and Zensar, Birlasoft and Tech Mahindra among midcaps.  Kotak is still constructive on the space, although returns will moderate from here.  “Infosys, HCL Technologies and Mphasis are our top picks,” Kotak said.

The scrip was trading at Rs 1866 as of writing, up 0.5% from its previous close. Meanwhile, Sensex fell 0.71% to 56,906.63 points.  Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd have achieved this milestone in market capitalisation in the past.  Infosys, whose stock has jumped over 52% so far this year, will announce its December quarter earnings on 12 January.  Cloud adoption and digital transformation will support strong demand for IT services over the next 3-5 years, said analysts. Infosys is among the best-positioned companies to benefit from strong demand, backed by its strategic investments in scaling up digital capabilities, winning market share, and expanding presence in Europe, they added.  “Infosys is well-placed to deliver industry-leading organic growth among large peers in the medium term. Margins are expected to remain under pressure due to supply-side challenges, roll-out of wage hike for senior employees, and weak seasonality, which will be partially offset by strong growth in digital business, operational efficiencies, and currency tailwinds,” brokerage firm Sharekhan said in a note to investors.  “The stock trades at 30x/26x its FY2023E/FY2024E earnings, which is justified, given strong growth potential, robust deal pipelines, robust execution, and improving ROCE (return on capital employed). We like Infosys because of its superior digital capability, consistent investments in talents, stable management, a strong capital allocation policy, and a healthy balance sheet,” the note added.  The brokerage firm expects 18.6% year-on-year growth in FY2022 and a 12.4% conpound annual rate over FY2022-FY2024E for Infosys, given broad-based demand, robust deal wins, and a healthy deal pipeline.  Last quarter the company increased its FY2022 revenue guidance to 14-16% on a constant currency basis from 12-14% earlier. The firm maintained its operating margins guidance at 22-24%.

Banking, auto and metal counters remained laggard while pharma and FMCG, along with IT, supported markets regain to some extent.  From the derivatives front, Call writers added hefty open interest at 17,200, 17,300 and 17,500 strikes, while Put writers added marginal open interest at 17,000 and 16,800 strikes.  We expect the markets to remain under pressure in the upcoming sessions as well and to tread on a volatile path. The bulls look a bit uncomfortable at the current juncture as the Nifty has managed to close below its 100-day exponential moving average on daily charts.  As far as Bank Nifty is concerned, it has major support at 35,300-35,100 zone, below which further downside into the prices can't be ruled out.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks  Max Healthcare Institute: Buy | LTP: Rs 380.20 | Stop Loss: Rs 340 | Target: Rs 422 | Return: 11 percent  After hitting its 52-week high of Rs 402.60 in September, the stock saw profit-booking at higher levels and retraced towards Rs 330 levels. The stock can be seen trading in a consolidation zone since then. In recent past, the stock took support at its 100-day exponential moving average on daily charts and formed a rounding bottom pattern to once again to reclaim a move above Rs 370 levels.  From the technical front, prices have given a breakout above the consolidation zone after nearly eight weeks. The rising volumes along with price action suggests for next up leg into the prices. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 370-380 for the upside target of Rs 422 with stop loss below Rs 340.    Dr Lal PathLabs: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,789.45 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,450 | Target: Rs 4,212 | Return: 11 percent  In a recent move, the stock took support at its 200-day exponential moving average on daily charts and bounced back sharply above Rs 3,700 levels after forming a double bottom pattern. At current juncture, the stock has managed to reclaim a move above its short-term moving averages and has given breakout above its multi week highs.  The rising volumes with rise in price suggest a long build-up into the stock which can push prices much higher from current levels. Traders can accumulate the stock in range of Rs 3,760-3,790 for the upside target of Rs 4,212 with stop loss below Rs 3,450.    Tata Consultancy Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,529.15 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,330 | Target: Rs 3,840 | Return: 9 percent  The stock tested its 52-week high of Rs 3,989.90 in October and since then seen trading lower on the back of profit-booking.

TCS,2021-11-30T07:09:12+05:30,Nandish Shah,"Hot Stocks | Buy these two, sell one for short-term gains. Here's why","Short-term trend of the Nifty is weak. Therefore, remain cautious till it closes above the 17,300 levels.","Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative &amp;amp; Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities  Nifty recovered more than 200 points from the low to end the day with gains of 28 points to 17,054. Short-term trend in the Nifty remains weak as it makes a lower top lower bottom formation on the daily chart. The Nifty is also trading below its all-important short-term moving averages.  In the derivatives, we have seen aggressive Call writing at 17,000-17,300 levels. Moreover, falling 5-day EMA (exponential moving average) is currently placed at 17,295 levels. Therefore, unless the Nifty closes above 17,000 level, the short-term trend will remain bearish.  The Nifty made an intraday low of 16,782 and bounced back. This level coincides with the previous top resistance of 16,700 which will interchange its role as a support. Therefore, we believe that on the lower side, 16,700-16,800 level will act as an immediate support.  To sum it up, we believe that, the short-term trend of the Nifty is weak. Therefore, our advice is to remain cautious till it closes above the 17,300 levels. On the lower side, we expect the Nifty to find an immediate support in the vicinity of 16,700-16,800.  The support for the Nifty is seen around 16,000 levels which is 23.6 percent retracement of the entire rally seen from the low of March 2020 to the all-time high of 18,604.  Here are two buy and one sell recommendations for the next 2-3 weeks:  Tata Consultancy Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,502 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,400 | Target: Rs 3,750 | Return: 7.1 percent  After forming multiple bottoms around Rs 3,400 levels, the stock price reversed northwards to close above its 5 and 20-day EMA. The primary trend of the stock is positive as it trades above its 200-day EMA. The daily RSI (relative strength index) line is placed above 50 and sloping upwards, indicating strength in the current uptrend.    Finolex Cables: Buy | LTP: Rs 557.9 | Stop Loss: Rs 530 | Target: Rs 620 | Return: 11.1 percent  The stock price has broken out on the monthly chart from the downward sloping trendline, adjoining the highs of February 2018 and July 2021.

The company, which employs over 5 lakh people, also reported an increase in attrition at 11.9 percent.  &quot;Currently, the short-term volatility is in terms of supply-side challenges mainly due to elevated attritions,&quot; Seksaria said, adding that in the quarter gone by, it also faced headwinds from currency,&quot; he said.  TCS has been able to manage better than peers on the supply side or human resources front because of its upfront investments even when demand had shown difficulties in the initial days of the pandemic, he added.  The same is seen in the 75,000 new hires done in the last one year, or over 43,000 hires in the first half of the ongoing FY22, he said.  The CFO said the company learnt from its experience of the global financial crisis of 2008, and expected demand to recover in a V-shape.  However, despite strong hiring, it was able to get employee costs down by 0.20 percent to 56.3 percent as it shifted tactics to hire more low-cost freshers, he said, making it clear that the company will continue to balance between freshers and laterals going forward.  &quot;Our investments going forward are more in terms of competency building, strengthening research and innovation and intellectual property,&quot; he said.  Seksaria said the company had realigned investments between the three as per business demands and the overall investments were at the same levels.  He said there has not been any material impact on the costs because of the pandemic, even though there have been a few changes in some items.  From a deal flow perspective, the company continues to be positive, adding that the new deal signing has always ranged between USD 7-9 billion.  The company has invested Rs 1,250 crore in the first half of the fiscal for physical infrastructure and will continue with similar activities, he said, adding that in FY21 it had invested Rs 3,000 crore.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-to-continue-investments-as-per-business-requirements-cfo-samir-seksaria-7568111.html

On October 8, TCS had reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,624 crore for the second quarter of 2021-22, registering a 14.1 percent on-year growth.  Its consolidated revenue during the July-September period stood at Rs 46,867 crore, up 16.8 percent over a year-ago quarter. The revenue growth in constant currency came in at 15.5 percent YoY.  On a sequential basis, profit grew 6.8 percent and the revenue increased by 3.2 percent in Q2FY22.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what foreign brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after its September quarter earnings:  Jefferies  The research house maintained hold rating with a target at Rs 3,950 per share as lack of positive surprises in the Q2 results offers limited scope for re-rating.  The Q2 revenue, which was up 4 percent in CC term, slightly missed the estimates, however, with 10 bps rise in margin and 7 percent growth in profit over the previous quarter, the stock was ahead of estimates.  Total contract value (TCV) at $7.6 billion was healthy and the company is confident of a strong growth outlook. In case of software as a service (SaaS) businesses, TCV provides clarity in the volume of business one can expect from a customer after a deal is signed. TCS has managed its margins well, despite supply pressures.  Macquarie  Macquarie has kept outperform call with a target at Rs 4,530 per share after the results marginally missed estimates due to a lower margin on supply-side issues.  It is well positioned to capture the demand strength. The research house has lowered its FY22 estimate for earnings per share (EPS) by 3 percent.  Kotak Institutional Equities  Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on the stock with a target at Rs 4,100 per share after the company’s revenue missed estimates due to a surprising moderation in growth in continental Europe.  The broking house has cut FY22-24 EPS estimates by 3-4percent and target by 3 percent and it feels that the company is better positioned than its peers to face the margin headwinds.  CLSA  The brokerage has maintained outperform rating with a target at Rs 4,050 per share after Q2 was a tad below estimates on both revenue growth and margins.  CLSA has cut the FY22-23 EPS estimates by 1 percent on modest order book and weak near-term margin outlook. It expects that incremental upside could be limited from current levels.  UBS  The research house has kept the neutral rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 4,180 per share.  It expects the stock to consolidate here with a slight downward bias and if the second half slows further, there may be a risk to FY23 consensus revenue forecasts.  Goldman Sachs  The research house has kept the buy rating with a target at Rs 4,657 per share as earnings were below estimates on revenue, margin and order book front.  It has cut the EPS estimates by 1-2 percent over FY22-26 and sees a strong deal pipeline given strong underlying demand momentum.

TCS,2021-10-11T09:19:08+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Trade Spotlight | What should investors do with TCS, Polycab India, Affle India and Chemplast Sanmar?","Here's what Mehul Kothari of Anand Rathi Shares &amp; Stock Brokers, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today.","ga5nedThe buying in Reliance Industries, technology stocks, PSU banks and select auto stocks helped the market close higher on October 8 continuing the uptrend for the second consecutive session. The dovish policy measures by the RBI also supported the market.  On October 8, the BSE Sensex closed above the 60,000-mark again with 381 points gains while the Nifty50 gained more than 100 points to close nearly 17,900 levels. The broader markets also joined the rally as the Nifty Midcap 100 index was up 0.43 percent and Smallcap 100 index gained 1.23 percent.  Stocks that were in focus included Polycab India, which closed 4.55 percent higher at Rs 2,529.80, Affle India (hit 5 percent upper circuit to close at record high of Rs 1,212), Chemplast Sanmar (gained 7.81 percent gains at Rs 801.75), and Tata Consultancy Services (closed with 1.1 percent gains at Rs 3,935.65).  Here's what Mehul Kothari of Anand Rathi Shares &amp;amp; Stock Brokers, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Tata Consultancy Services  TCS is one of the leading IT giant in India and has been trading in a strong uptrend. There is no sign of weakness so far in any time frame.  At this point in time the stock has a resistance at the psychological level of Rs 4,000. A sustainable move above the same might bring the stock towards Rs 4,200 and more.  On the downside support is at Rs 3,700. Investors should keep holding the stock from here on.  Polycab India  Given here is the weekly line chart of Polycab which depicts that the stock has rallied one side from the bottom of around Rs 620 towards the recent top of Rs 2,627 without any meaningful correction.  The stock has rallied almost 4x and it seems a bit exhausted. There is a possibility of some consolidation in the coming weeks. Thus traders should refrain from having any heavy positions in the stock.  While investors can continue to hold the same till the time there is clear change of trend. On the levels front, Rs 2,300-2,700 might be the range going ahead.    Chemplast Sanmar  It's newly relisted stocks and that is the reason why we don't have much historical data of Chemplast Sanmar. However the given hourly chart construes that the stock is rising with good momentum and might continue to do the same till the time it is trading above Rs 750 mark.  A move below Rs 750 would halt the momentum for time being. Traders should book longs at higher levels.    Affle India  The stock is in strong up trend and recently it had a split in a ratio of 10:2. Now the stock is trading near Rs 1,200 mark. The adjusted all-time high of Affle is around Rs 1,250 mark. A daily close above the same might result in fresh buying traction.  We expect the stock to move towards Rs 1,400 or so once it sustain above Rs 1,250 mark. On the downside, support is placed at Rs 1,100.  It is a trend deciding support for short term. Investors should keep holding the stock while traders can look for fresh entry above Rs 1,250.

TCS,2021-10-10T08:32:42+05:30,Moneycontrol News,TCS Q2 earnings miss street estimates; check what brokerages say,TCS’ revenue growth in constant currency came in at 15.5 percent YoY.,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on October 8 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,624 crore for the quarter ended September 2021 (Q2FY22), registering a 14.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth.  TCS posted consolidated revenue during the July-September period at Rs 46,867 crore, up 16.8 percent over a year-ago quarter.  The revenue growth in constant currency came in at 15.5 percent YoY.  However, the numbers were largely below the street estimates. A CNBC-TV18 poll of analysts had estimated profit at Rs 9,731 crore on revenue of Rs 47,466 crore for the quarter under review.  At the operating level, EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin at 25.60 percent for the September 2021 quarter also missed CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of 26.05 percent. Margin grew by 0.1 percent sequentially, but declined 0.6 percent YoY.  Also Read - Santosh Meena of Swastika expects correction in TCS stock price post earnings, but Tata Motors still looks attractive  Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after Q2FY22 results:  Motilal Oswal  Given TCS’ size, capabilities, and portfolio stretch, it is rightly positioned to leverage expected industry growth.  The company has consistently maintained its market leadership and shown best in-class execution. This gives the company continued room to maintain its industry-leading margin and demonstrate industry-leading return ratios.  Motilal Oswal remains positive on the company, given its strong growth outlook. But high valuations leave limited room for disappointment.  A miss on estimates in 2QFY22, coupled with a soft margin outlook, can result in near term pressure on the stock.  The target price of Rs 3,770 per share implies 31x FY23E EPS and maintained neutral rating.  Sharekhan  The broking house broadly maintained the estimates for FY2023 and FY2024 because of strong broad-based demand, resilient operating performance, strong deal wins and healthy deal pipeline.  It believes TCS is well positioned to capture growth and transformation opportunities given its competencies across technologies and verticals, strong contextual knowledge, excellent product and platform portfolio and solid execution capabilities.  It expects the company’s US Dollar revenue and earnings to clock an 11/14 percent CAGR over FY2022-24E.  Any correction in stock price would provide a good investment opportunity for long-term investors. Hence, maintain a buy rating on TCS with a revised price target of Rs 4,400.  IDBI Capital  The research firm fine-tunes its forecast and raises the EBIT margin by 30bps/20bps to 25.8/25.9 percent resulting in an increase in EPS by 2.6/5.1 percent to Rs 106/121 for FY22E/FY23E.  It recommends holding with a target price of Rs 4,072 (versus Rs 3,498) based on PER of 32x FY23E.  Emkay  Broking house cut FY22/23/24 EPS estimates by 1.2/0.3/0.3 percent after factoring in the Q2 performance miss.  The operating performance miss for the second consecutive quarter and rich valuations will weigh on stock performance.  The research house maintained a hold with a target price of Rs 3,700 (28x Sep'23E EPS).  KRChoksey  It expects strong deal momentum across verticals, ease in travel restrictions and continued investments in newer technologies such as product &amp;amp; platform which will help maintain the growth momentum in the medium term future.  It is assigning a P/E multiple of 32x to the FY24 estimated EPS of Rs 135 to arrive at a target price of Rs 4,256 per share (earlier target of Rs 4,053), an upside of 8 percent over the CMP. Accordingly, it reiterates an accumulate rating to the stock.  HDFC Securities  TCS continues to witness strength in its core business segment and has bagged higher mid-sized deals spread across verticals.  The ongoing supply side crunch (attrition increased to 11.9 percent, yet industry-best) and return of discretionary spend will limit margin expansion despite operating leverage and higher pricing.  Our target price of Rs 4,180 is based on 32x Dec-23E EPS with EPS CAGR of 14 percent over FY21-24E. Maintain Add rating.  Prabhudas Lilladher  It believes TCS’ low attrition (as compared to peers) is a competitive advantage in the current environment where growth is constrained more by supply rather than demand.  TCS’ well managed supply side engine is an ace in the current battle for talent. It believes that leaders have a far broader set of capabilities and they end up addressing a larger portion of the IT spending pool, which helps them to grow at a solid rate on a high base.  It projects revenue growth of 16/13.7 percent dollar terms for FY22/23E respectively. We arrive at a DCF based target price of Rs 4,113 (earlier: Rs 3,968).

TCS,2021-10-09T13:44:26+05:30,News18,TCS Q2 results: Key highlights from the company’s earnings concall,Management guided that demand environment is strong and is sustainable over the medium term.,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on October 8 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,624 crore for the quarter ended September 2021 (Q2FY22), registering a 14.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, driven by broad-based demand and resilient margins.  The profit was also driven by other income that increased 21.6 percent YoY (up 54.1 percent QoQ).  The profit growth on a YoY basis was after the adjustment for provision for legal claim reported by the company in September 2020 quarter. The reported profit growth was 28.7 percent YoY.  Its consolidated revenue during the July-September period stood at Rs 46,867 crore, up 16.8 percent over a year-ago quarter, with double-digit growth across business verticals, led by ramp-up in order books, recovery in India business and increase in digital spending by corporates.  The revenue growth in constant currency came in at 15.5 percent YoY.  Here are the highlights from TCS' Q1 FY22 earnings call as compiled by Narnolia Financial Advisors:  The 2QFY22 was a strong quarter with all the industry verticals growing at mid-teens or more driven by increase outsourcing, investment in building digital core, and growth and transformation.  The company’s revenue grew by 4% QoQ and 15.5% YoY in CC terms, 3.2% QoQ and 16.8% YoY in Rupee term to Rs 46867 crore and 2.9% QoQ and 16.8% YoY in dollar terms to USD 6.333 billion.  The BFSI segment grew by 17% YoY in CC terms and crossed USD 2 billion quarterly revenue run rate.  Good acceleration was visible in communication and media which grew by 15.6% YoY and Technology and Services grew 14.8% YoY in CC terms.  Supply-side shortage and increase in employee churn had led to higher back filing expense and greater use of subcontractors across the industry.  Currency was not favorable in the quarter as the US dollar appreciated and all other currencies depreciated against rupee creating margin a headwind.  EBIT Margin expanded by 10 bps QoQ to 25.6% despite the headwinds due to disciplined aggregation.  The order book for the quarter was healthy with a TCV of USD 7.6 billion distributed across verticals and geographies.  BFSI segment deal wins stood at TCV of USD 2.1 billion, the retail segment with USD 1.2 billion and North America with USD 3.9 billion TCV.  During the quarter there was robust client addition in every revenue bucket.  Management guided that the demand environment is strong and is sustainable over the medium term.  Management guided that margins were maintained in the quarter despite the supply-side issue but not certain for coming quarters.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tcs-q2-results-key-highlights-from-the-companys-earnings-concall-7563151.html
TCS,2021-10-09T08:00:47+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar," DAILY VOICE | Santosh Meena of Swastika expects correction in TCS stock price post earnings, but Tata...",TCS witnessed another quarter of strong earnings but there is a slight miss on expectations especially on the margin front. The deal win is $7.6 billion versus $8.1 billion in the last quarter which is a minor negative factor.,"Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart, who has more than 10 years of experience in the financial markets with expertise in technical &amp;amp; derivative analysis, said TCS witnessed another quarter of strong earnings but there is a slight miss on expectations especially on the margin front.  &quot;The stock has already rallied ahead of results so we can expect some profit booking on the back of minor miss on expectations, hire attrition rate and lower deal wins however long term outlook is still bullish and any dip will be a buying opportunity,&quot; he added.  In the realty sector, he believes this is just the beginning of a bull run and it may continue for the next 2-3 years. &quot;However, an intermediate correction in stock prices can't be ruled out.&quot;  Q: What is your analysis over RBI monetary policy? Have you changed your projections (inflation, growth, rate hikes etc) after the policy?  The RBI monetary policy was in line with expectations where MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) decided to keep rates unchanged with an accommodative stance. RBI signals normalization of liquidity by scrapping GSAP (Government Securities Acquisition Programme) but also said that they will continue with OMOs (open market operations) and operations if there will be any requirement. The market reacted positively post RBI policy but cooled off from the day's high as there was no major surprise in the policy.  Some economists were expecting a hike in the reverse repo rate because they want RBI to be ahead of curve amid rising inflation globally. RBI cut down its inflation forecast to 5.3 percent for FY22 but I believe there is an upside risk for inflation amid a sharp rise in commodity prices globally.  RBI retains the GDP (gross domestic products) growth target at 9.5 percent in FY22 that may surprise in the upside if there will be no negative development on the Covid front. We may see a hike in the reverse repo rate in the next two policies and the difference between repo rate and reverse repo rate will again be brought down to 0.25 percent before any hike in repo rate.  Q: Do you think inflation and oil prices can dampen the market sentiment and become a cause for major correction in the near future?  I believe the biggest risk for the global equity market is inflation. The Indian equity market is in strong bullish momentum and it is ignoring inflation risk for the time being but sooner or later it will take cognizance of this fact and that may lead to some correction in the market however any correction will be a good buying opportunity.  Q: Auto and Realty stocks had a strong run this week. What are major reasons and should one buy these stocks now or be selective? What can be bought amongst them?  If we talk about the real estate sector then there is a turnaround story. The sector is coming out of 10 years of the down cycle where the last 5 years were very painful. The strong recovery in the sector can be attributed to low interest rates, supportive government policies, cut in stamp duty, consolidation in the industry due to RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority), and most importantly improvement in sentiments. Most of the companies are posting strong sales growth and management are very confident about future growth. I believe this is just the beginning of a bull run in the realty sector and it may continue for the next 2-3 years however intermediate correction in stock prices can't be ruled out.  If we talk about the auto sector then the story is not so promising because there is still a bumpy ride for many auto companies due to the rise in input cost &amp;amp; competition and shortage of semiconductors. However, the auto ancillary sector may outperform. The auto sector is witnessing a catch up as the sector was underperforming the overall market and there is hope that we could see a strong demand recovery amid the festival season. Tata Motors is outperforming the sector because of its inherent strength where Morgan Stanley recently upgraded the share to outperform for the target of Rs 448. Tata Motors is showing a turnaround story on the backdrop of the E-vehicle segment. It was one of the most undervalued stocks in the auto sector and it still has attractive valuations. It is gaining market share in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment whereas JLR (Jaguar Land Rover) business is likely to show a strong recovery.  Q: Has the TCS' quarterly earnings met your expectations? Is it overpriced now with 36 percent gains YTD and should one buy the stock now? What is your broad expectations on rest of IT stocks earnings?  TCS witnessed another quarter of strong earnings but there is a slight miss on expectations especially on the margin front. There is double-digit growth in all verticals and management commentary is very bullish where they again emphasized on-demand as a once-in-a-decade opportunity. The attrition rate has jumped to 11.9 percent however it is lower than the industry average and the company has increased the hiring target that indicates both strong demand and a higher attrition rate expectation.  The deal win is $7.6 billion versus $8.1 billion in the last quarter which is a minor negative factor. The stock has already rallied ahead of results so we can expect some profit booking on the back of minor miss on expectations, hire attrition rate and lower deal wins however long term outlook is still bullish and any dip will be a buying opportunity.  Q: Fitch Ratings cut its economic growth forecast for FY22 to 8.7 percent from 10 percent due to severe second Covid wave. Do you agree with Fitch Ratings and what is your forecast?  Rating upgrades and downgrades come with a lag, and the impact of second-wave is not as severe as expected. I believe the Indian economy may witness double-digit growth in FY22 because we are seeing a strong recovery in most of the sectors.  Q: Can you name the sectors which could report double-digit earnings growth and fall in earnings growth in Q2FY22 versus Q2FY21?  The banking, Metal, Chemical, Realty and IT sectors may witness strong growth momentum while the Auto companies are likely to post a weak quarter.

Earnings will be announced on October 8.  The stock gained 16 percent since July and rallied 22 percent in the financial year FY22 so far.  Topline  The growth in revenue is expected to be driven by conversion of earlier strong orders, recovery in Indian markets after fall in June quarter, and strong spending on digital by corporates.  &quot;We expect strong constant currency revenue growth rate of 5.3 percent powered by strong spends on digital and short cycle programmes, conversion of strong bookings of earlier quarter into revenues, and recovery in India after a sharp contraction of 14.1 percent in the June 2021 quarter,&quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities which expects growth of 4.7 percent in international markets and 15 percent in India business.  Prabhudas Lilladher expects robust growth of 5.5 percent in revenue in constant currency terms, 4.7 percent QoQ growth in dollar revenue driven by ramp-up of strong order book of previous quarters, rebound in India business after a sharp decline in Q1FY22, gains in market share, and aggressive client spends in digital smaller-duration deals.  Deal Wins  Most experts feel the deal wins in the quarter ended September 2021 are expected to be largely similar to Q1 levels.  &quot;We expect $8 billion of total contract value (TCV) powered by mid-sized deals. We do not expect any skew in TCV from mega-deals. TCV of deals will decline on YoY comparison even as previous year number was skewed by Phoenix mega-deal of $2.5 billion,&quot; said Kotak.  TCS had continued to have strong deal momentum with TCV of $8.1 billion in Q1FY22, up 17.3 percent YoY.  Operating Performance  The margin is likely to expand 50-70 bps sequentially due to revenue growth and normalisation of wage hikes. TCS rolled out wage hike in Q1FY22 starting April 1, 2021.  &quot;We expect the margin to increase slightly by 50bps QoQ as headwinds of higher wages, higher retention and higher hiring costs to backfill attrition will be offset by revenue growth leverage and pyramid optimisation,&quot; said Prabhudas Lilladher.  According to Emkay Research, EBIT margin is likely to expand by 70bps QoQ due to normalisation of salary hikes and revenue growth led operating leverage.  Key things to watch  Demand trends in key verticals like BFSI, Retail, Manufacturing and Communications; large deal pipeline and reasons for lack of mega deal; pricing environment; margin outlook; December 2021 quarter outlook - likely seasonality; supply-side challenges and attrition; recovery in India business after contraction in June 2021 quarter; durability of growth and magnitude of opportunity from the aggressive cloud shift by clients are key things to watch out for, said brokerages.

The extended partnership builds on a two-decade long relationship between the two organisations, that began with the implementation of the TCS BaNCS core banking solution in 2001.  As part of the new contract, TCS will continue to maintain and enhance SBI's application estate around core banking, trade finance, financial reporting, and financial inclusion with new features and functionality, a statement said.  This will support the bank's ability to launch newer offerings and respond to business and regulatory changes, it added.  In addition, TCS will continue to leverage its deep contextual knowledge of SBI's business and technology landscape to help the bank with large transformation programmes to help make day-to-day banking accessible, intuitive, easy, and secure.  “Technology and innovation have been at the core of SBI's growth and transformation journey over the last two decades. TCS has been a valuable partner since the beginning and has supported us in building and running a high-performing, resilient and scalable core banking platform that is foundational to all our digital initiatives,” Ravindra Pandey, DMD and CIO of SBI, said.  SBI is pleased to extend its relationship with TCS as the two organisations continue to work together to launch new initiatives for enhanced customer experience, he added.  “TCS' two decade-long relationship with SBI is a testament to our customer-centricity and our approach of harnessing collective knowledge to create greater futures. We are delighted to continue this partnership as the bank embarks on its next wave of growth,” TCS Country Head – India Ujjwal Mathur said.  TCS is helping build Bharat Craft – an omnichannel, online B2B e-commerce platform which would serve as a marketplace for MSMEs, jointly driven by SBI and the Government of India. Prior to that, TCS had collaborated with SBI to plan and execute the simultaneous merger of five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank.  The colossal undertaking involved integrating over 200 business processes, over 43 IT applications, 17,500 products, and over 50 billion database records, and impacting over 50,000 tellers across 7,000 branches, the statement said adding that all goals were achieved – without any interruption to services – in six weeks.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/sbi-extends-contract-with-tcs-for-five-years-7550251.html
TCS,2021-10-04T07:15:47+05:30,Sameet Chavan,Hot Stocks | Here is why you should buy Kirloskar Ferrous and sell TCS,"The fear index India VIX also spiked, hence volatility will remain on the higher side during this week as well","Trading started on a positive note on September 27 owing to favourable global cues. The Nifty was about to clock a fresh high but modest profit- booking at higher levels pulled it lower. The next day, we witnessed some nervousness in the global markets which had a rub-off effect on Indian shares. The Nifty came off sharply to test sub-17,600 levels but also saw a sharp recovery towards the end to reclaim the 17,700 mark at the close. This was followed by some consolidation and again some weakness on the last day of the week as the Nifty ended below 17,600.  The Nifty finally snapped its recent winning streak as it ended nearly a couple of percent lower but September was a good month for the bulls as they added nearly 3 percent (month-on-month) to their kitty.  For the second half of September, we maintained a cautious stance and the market moved much more than we expected. In such a strong bull run, it may not be wise to be sceptical but with the kind of time-projections and negative divergence in momentum oscillators we are observing, we would continue with the same.  The market is over-stretched and can surprise us, hence we reiterate staying light. We have already witnessed a glimpse of this possibility this week, but structurally nothing has been dented yet.  As far as levels are concerned, the upside in the coming week seems capped and we do not expect the Nifty to go beyond the sturdy wall of 17,800–17,950. On the flip side, 17,450 and 17,300 are seen as key supports. First sign of weakness would be visible only after breaking this lower range.  The fear index India VIX has spiked. We expect volatility to remain on the higher side in the coming week as well. We advise traders to stay light and follow strict stop losses for existing positions.  We are also observing good stock-specific action in the market. One can continue following it but try to book timely profits as well.  Here is one buy call and one sell call for the next two-three weeks:  Kirloskar Ferrous: Bullish | LTP: Rs 257.45 | Stop Loss: Rs 241 | Target: Rs 284 | Return: 10.3 percent  Since early August, this stock has undergone a decent price and time correction. In the initial down move, the price retraced by 50 percent of its previous upmove and then slipped into consolidation mode.  After cementing its position around this key retracement level, the stock managed to give a decisive breakout from the recent congestion phase.  With this, we can also see prices traversing the key short- term moving average of '89-EMA' (exponential moving average) placed at Rs 245. Since the breakout has happened on sizable volumes, we recommend buying for a short-term target of Rs 284. The stop loss can be placed at Rs 241.    Tata Consultancy Services: Bearish | LTP: Rs 3,730.20 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,810 | Target: Rs 3,620 – 3,580 | Return: (3-4) percent  IT was one of the lead sectors to pull the market up from its lows of March 2020. In the last 15 – 16 months, this heavyweight basket has already given some mesmerising moves without a pause.  In the previous week, the Nifty IT index, however, nosedived from all-time highs and does not bode well for the bulls. Looking at the weekly candle of the index, we expect some correction in the near term.  As far as TCS is concerned, we see the price breaching the daily 20-EMA for the first time in recent months. This is coupled with a negative crossover in '5&amp;amp;20-EMA', an indication of weakness in the near term.  One can look to sell with a strict stop loss of Rs 3,810. The immediate target can be seen in the Rs 3,620–3,580 range.

TCS,2021-08-22T16:28:06+05:30,Chintan Girish Modi,'Conscientious managers sleep better': Phani Medicharla of Tata Consultancy Services,"Phani Medicharla on collaboration as a means to an end, supporting team members who do well on their own, self-care and team-care, and managing teams remotely.","Phani Medicharla works as a senior manager in a technology leadership role at Tata Consultancy Services in Stockholm. Looking back at his previous experiences in Asia-Pacific, North America and Europe, he recalls having benefited most from working with managers who gave him “the freedom to explore and experiment on the job”.  As he took risks and made tough decisions, they watched from a distance and offered gentle, timely nudges. With the aim of paying it forward, Medicharla decided to compile his learnings in the form of a book titled The Conscientious Manager: Nurturing Workplace Ethics and Synergies. It was published in June 2021 by SAGE India.  Excerpts from an interview:  Why do you consider being conscientious an essential quality for managers?  A manager’s role comes with a great degree of ‘entrustment’ of time, assets, and expectations of outcomes. Managers need to safeguard this by being transparent, integral, and fully committed – essentially, conscientious. This helps to cultivate success and scale it. Conscientiousness helps managers accept current realities and not get stuck with yesteryear perceptions. I also believe that conscientious managers sleep better.  How can managers strike a balance between optimizing productivity and cultivating relationships with team members during the Covid-19 pandemic?  These shouldn’t be seen as separate objectives. Having a good relationship with the team has a positive influence on productivity. Among other things, productivity is the outcome of making several fine adjustments and openly sharing feedback. A quick input or timely decision sometimes saves days or even months of effort, and can make or mar a project.  During the pandemic when the associates do not experience conventional touchpoints, and non-verbal communication is slim, managers must be sensitive to the team’s situation and constantly give a feeling of being there for them.  What self-care strategies do you adopt and recommend?  With due respect to aspects of confidentiality and sensitivity of information, for a majority of scenarios, leadership need not be a lonely path. Leaning on the team, being open about strengths and weaknesses, helping them understand priorities and trying to bring cheer and energy to every conversation are all important self-care and team care behaviours. It is important that your team understands the real you. Letting the team second-guess what your thoughts are, especially during important conversations and assignments, is a potential stress-inducer, besides derailing the actual work. Managers should make an effort to understand their team and be understood. I also practise meditation and strive to inculcate a holistic purpose for life. Cycling and jump rope are my favourite exercise routines.  What would you say to managers who are technology sceptics and feel that virtual workplaces have compromised their ability to micromanage?  I believe that the stated scepticism of those managers comes from their deep care for their team members and the delivery outcomes. They should learn to gently move the onus and accountability to the team and make it a participatory endeavour rather than a matter of invigilation.  Encouraging associates to watch out for each other promotes a healthy culture of mentorship and takes away the burden of a manager monitoring everyone and everything. Being approachable and accommodating helps the team to push the insight to you voluntarily rather than having to chase them for updates.  How can managers motivate team members to take ownership?  If managers spend time explaining the big picture, and help teams understand the relevance and value of the job to themselves and the organization, there is a higher chance of ownership. It is important to let the team express concerns and constraints, so that they can approach the work with full commitment. Fear of failure is a major derailer, and managers can play a big role in assuring the team to tackle the same. Another key factor is to let the team know that they are making a difference, constantly, and not once in six months or a year.  Why is it important to be a team player?  Belongingness to a cause is a powerful motivator. It brings our best selves to the fore and enhances what and how we learn and grow. Being part of a team and contributing to the betterment of that ecosystem makes one lead a more fulfilling life. Even if you are an individual consultant with a subscription model of a few hours of work per week, try to associate yourself with the team’s principles and work for their mission. There are other practical advantages of reciprocity – leaning on others during tough times, learning new skills, visibility, and amplified fun.  How can managers support team members who are most effective when left alone to work on a task rather than forced to collaborate?  It is important to understand the nature of collaboration, and clarify it to the associates. There could be hesitations ranging from ownership of the work output or unwillingness to share ideas, especially if the environment is very competitive. Sometimes associates from separate groups do not collaborate well as their measures are not aligned or each group measures for different outcomes.  Collaboration must be seen as a means to an end. Forcing people to collaborate without a clear view on the expectations can be counter-productive. Managers must provide the empowerment and assurance while trying to bring individual performers together, and give some settling time before they become a collaborative team.  What can managers do to ensure that their feedback is kind and constructive?  Every associate has a mental model of their manager. It is important that this perception has some elements of “my manager wants me to be better and does everything to support me and the team” in the associate’s mind. Managers should be sensitive to opportunities in the day-to-day grind of the work to improve their reputation on this front. Once empathy and trust are established, feedback will be well received. Speaking sweetly doesn’t help if the associate does not perceive the manager as an ally in their personal growth story or that of the team.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/conscientious-managers-sleep-better-phani-medicharla-ohf-tata-consultancy-services-7371601.html

The Mumbai-based company will also hire more than 220 employees by 2023, it said in a regulatory filing.  &quot;TCS will also continue to expand the reach of its STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and Computer Science education programmes in Arizona by increasing teacher training and online content for students over the next two years,&quot; it added.  TCS' Phoenix Business Centre -- one of 30 TCS facilities in the US -- serves more than 50 customers across Arizona.  Currently, it has more than 780 employees in the state, helping clients in banking, manufacturing, healthcare, and utilities, manage their IT operations and harness technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and enterprise software to achieve their growth and transformation objectives.  The new positions will be based at the Phoenix centre as well as in client offices around the state.  According to the filing, TCS has been among the top two US recruiters of IT services talent, hiring more than 21,500 employees in the past five years.

It is well-positioned to benefit from the strong demand environment for the IT sector.  Goldman Sachs | Rating: Buy | Target: Cut to Rs 3,703 from Rs 3,853  The brokerage house cut the target price on the company due to various factors. 1) The company announced a cut in EPS estimates by 2-5% to factor in the loss from the India business and the lower margin. 2) It expects few discretionary expenses to return by the end of FY22. But strong domain expertise can help maintain double-digit revenue growth over FY22-24.  Citi | Rating: Sell | Target: Cut to Rs 3,080 from Rs 3,220  The brokerage has a Sell rating on the stock with a reduced target price due to lower-than-expected revenues. The weakness in the India business was expected, it said.  The brokerage further said that it finds the stock's valuation high at FY20-23 EPS (earnings per share) CAGR estimate of 7%  JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 3,680  The brokerage maintained an overweight rating on the stock despite below expectation revenues and EPS. It said that the company continued to see strong deal wins, which is a positive.  UBS | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 3,345  The Q1 revenue and margin missed the forecasts.

Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 3,750  We tweaked our earnings estimates for FY2022E/FY2023E factoring in a weaker-than-expected show, anticipated recovery in the India business’ performance, healthy deal wins and a strong deal pipeline. Strong deal wins create the platform for strong revenue growth in FY2022.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 3,776  IT Services has entered into a technology upcycle, with cloud- and data-driven deals coming into the market.

TCS, which kicks off the June quarter earnings season on July 8, is also expected to report margin contraction because of higher wage costs, while other income is expected to support profitability. The market will also look out for an update on the management’s expectation of double-digit growth in FY22.  The stock touched a record high of Rs 3,399 in June 2021. It rallied 56 percent in the past year and gained 14 percent so far in 2021.  Due to low base last year, analysts are not looking at YoY comparison. On a QoQ basis there is no impact of Covid on the company's topline.  &quot;No impact of Covid coupled with the seasonally strong quarter, digital traction and ramp up deals will drive Q1FY22 revenues. TCS is expected to register 4.0 percent QoQ growth in constant currency led by anticipated improvement in demand from BFSI, healthcare and retail, acceleration in digital technologies and ramp up of deals. Further, cross currency tailwind would lead to revenue growth of 4.2 percent QoQ in dollar terms,&quot; said ICICI Direct which sees 8.1 percent sequential growth in profit and 5.4 percent in rupee revenue for June quarter.  Rupee revenue growth is expected to be higher than dollar revenue due to rupee depreciation.  Kotak Institutional Equities expects strong constant currency revenue growth rate of 3.7 percent, powered by seasonal uptick in spending by clients, conversion of strong bookings of the earlier quarter into revenues, and market share gains. &quot;We expect around 4.5 percent growth in international markets and 0.5 percent hit on growth from decline in India business,&quot; said the brokerage.  At the operating level, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin is expected to contract around 100-150 bps due to wage hike on sequential basis, but there could be sharp increase on year-on-year basis.  On profitability, &quot;we expect EBIT margin to decline 100 bps QoQ due to wage revisions and potential drag from India business. We believe TCS' timely and consistent recruitment, robust supply-side engine and people practices will minimize margin impact from wage revisions,&quot; said Kotak.  The brokerage expects robust deal total contract value (TCV) powered by large deals, and expects robust revenue outlook of double-digit growth with indications of even mid-teens growth.

TCS,2021-07-05T14:30:10+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar," IT Q1 FY22 earnings preview: Experts see robust revenue growth, but wage revision, tight labour market may...","Brokerages expect IT stocks to continue trading at premium valuations given the order pipeline and digitalisation. Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies are the top consensuses picks.  ","Tech companies, which have been in the limelight since the coronavirus pandemic broke out, are set to kickstart financial year 2022 on a strong note, with most analysts expecting strong growth in revenue across the sector.  According to analysts, largecap IT firms could report revenue growth of 2-4.5 percent in constant currency terms, while the midcap IT firms are likely to register a 3-7 percent growth on a sequential basis. The strong deal pipeline and increased spending across verticals will be the key drivers for revenue growth, they say.  &quot;IT companies have not seen any impact of the second Covid wave on the topline. Further, this being a seasonally strong quarter, coupled with acceleration in digital technologies &amp;amp; improved deal pipeline are further expected to drive IT companies' revenues,&quot; said ICICI Direct.  The brokerage expects BFSI, retail, manufacturing, hi-tech and life-science to drive revenues in the quarter. In addition, the brokerage expects a discount reversal in companies having exposure to travel verticals.  Furthermore, &quot;IT companies are also seeing a demand tailwind in terms of cost takeout by clients (led by higher offshoring &amp;amp; automation), vendor consolidation opportunities and traction in small &amp;amp; medium deals, which could further propel demand in coming quarters,&quot; said the brokerage.  Kotak Institutional Equities also expects a strong QoQ revenue growth, which will be driven by seasonal strength and increased spendings.  To Know All Earnings Related News, Click Here  &quot;We expect Infosys to lead the growth in Tier-1 IT companies with sequential growth rate of 4.5 percent, followed by TCS (3.7 percent in constant currency), and Wipro (3.1 percent on an organic basis, 9.4 percent including Capco and Eximius Design acquisitions),&quot; said Kotak.  &quot;Tech Mahindra (2.3 percent reported, 1.5 percent organic) and HCL Technologies (1 percent) will report muted quarters. Revenue growth will likely hit 9.3-19.2 percent on YoY comparison courtesy to favourable Covid-impacted base quarter comparison of June 2020 and strong rebound in subsequent quarters.&quot;  Midcap Segment Growth  &quot;Mid-tier companies will report strong growth led by strong growth from top clients, a mix of higher spending and share gains. Path towards normalization of spending in the impacted vertical of travel and transportation and accelerated digital spends,&quot; said Kotak which sees Mindtree will lead the way with 6.8 percent QoQ growth, followed by Mphasis (5 percent in constant currency) and L&amp;amp;T Infotech (3.5 percent).  Motilal Oswal also expects upbeat revenue traction in midcap IT firms, with the exception of Cyient, which may decline by 4 percent QoQ and the impact of COVID-19 on the workforce during Q1 FY22.  Margin Performance  Overall, the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin is expected to decline across the board.  &quot;Reasons for the decline are threefold—(1) companies such as TCS, Tech Mahinda, L&amp;amp;T Infotech and L&amp;amp;T Technology Services have rolled out wage increases, (2) decline in utilization rates as strong demand normalizes trends after abnormally high rates in the past two quarters and (3) impact of attrition and tight labor market conditions leading to higher cost of lateral recruitment,&quot; said Kotak.  The brokerage expects a sequential EBIT margin decline of 110-260 bps for companies that have announced wage revisions.  In case of midcaps, ICICI Direct feels Tier-2 IT companies' margins are expected to be impacted in the range of 40-300 bps mainly led by wage hikes. &quot;L&amp;amp;T Infotech is expected to be impacted the most due to reversal of provisions in SG&amp;amp;A and wage hike impact,&quot; said the brokerage.  FY22 Commentary  Infosys and Wipro are expected revise their full-year and quarterly guidance, but HCL Technologies is likely to retain FY22 revenue growth guidance.  &quot;We expect Infosys to revise its FY22 revenue growth guidance upward to 13-15 percent in constant currency YoY (current 12-14 percent). HCL Technologies is expected to retain its double-digit revenue growth guidance for FY22. Wipro is expected to guide for 5.5-7.5 percent constant-currency QoQ revenue growth for Q2FY22,&quot; said Emkay Global.  Kotak expects others firms to maintain a healthy demand outlook.  &quot;TCS can grow in mid-teens in FY22, while Wipro will hit double-digit organic revenue growth after 10 years. Mid-tier companies are in the race of calling out industry-leading growth. Mphasis expects to report industry-leading growth in Direct International. Mindtree also expects industry-leading growth. Consensus expects L&amp;amp;T Infotech to hit 16 percent growth in FY22,&quot; the brokerage explained.  Top Picks  Brokerages expect IT stocks to continue trading at premium valuations given the order pipeline and digitalisation. Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies are the top consensuses picks.  Kotak is constructive and recommended Infosys as the top pick followed by Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies.  Emkay, which prefers Tier-I stocks over midcaps, said its pecking order is Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra.  ICICI Direct prefers Infosys among tier-1 companies and Mindtree &amp;amp; Coforge from the midcap segment.  &quot;Strong sequential growth and the expectation of a lucrative guidance for FY22 should help sustain the rally in IT stocks, despite their premium valuations,&quot; said Motilal Oswal which continued with a bottom-up stance for sectorial picks.  Among largecap players, the brokerage likes Infosys and HCL Technologies. &quot;We expect Infosys to deliver top quartile growth, backed by strong deal wins ($14 billion in FY21, up 56 percent YoY), justifying its premium valuation. HCL will receive dual benefit from massive Cloud adoption, given its resilient expertise in IMS and gradual pickup in P&amp;amp;P, led by its ability to transform and renovate legacy products,&quot; the brokerage reasoned.  In the midcap space, Motilal Oswal prefers L&amp;amp;T Technology Services, Mphasis, Cyient, and Zen Technologies.  &quot;We expect L&amp;amp;T Technology Services to deliver strong growth (on a lower base) for FY22, led by a recovery in the ER&amp;amp;D industry. We expect a recovery in Cyient on stabilization in the Aerospace vertical and increasing ER&amp;amp;D spends. Zen Technologies remains a tactical play, with an expected business recovery on management change and the adoption of a new strategy,&quot; the brokerage reasoned.

The company's revenue grew by 4 percent to Rs 43,705 crore compared to the previous quarter. The revenue in dollar terms grew by 5 percent sequentially to $5,989 million against 5.1 percent growth seen in the previous quarter.  Also Read: TCS Q4 profit jumps 6.3% QoQ to Rs 9,246 crore, CC revenue growth at 4.2% with highest-ever quarterly deal wins  Here is what brokerages have to say on the stock and company after Q4 numbers:  CLSA | Rating: Outperform | Target: Raised to Rs 3,560 from Rs 3,370  CLSA lifted FY22/FY23 EPS estimates by 3 percent/2 percent on Q4 margin defence and USD-INR rate reset. The valuations are optically rich and limit absolute upside.  The cash generation and liberal capital return policy should help to sustain outperformance. The macro demand strength should sustain its relative outperformance versus the broader market.  Goldman Sachs | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 3,646  TCS is one of the best-positioned global IT services companies. The key positive surprise from the results was the very strong order book of $9.2 billion. The order book is largely of smaller sized deals, implying faster revenue conversion. The management sees double-digit revenue with the current margin band beyond FY22.  Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 3,750  It was a strong end to the year with the company well-positioned for a robust FY22. With largely in-line performance, the broking house maintains FY22/23 estimates. The sector has entered technology upcycle and the company is expected to continue delivering industry-leading growth.  Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 3,640  The company is on track to double-digit growth for FY22 and well-positioned to benefit from three key spending themes.  Citi | Rating: Sell | Target: Raised to Rs 2,935 from Rs 2,870  The valuations were at 31x 1-year forward price in all positives. Citi raise EPS estimates by 2 percent for FY22/23, partly on USD-INR rate but continues to prefer Infosys over TCS.  Dolat Capital | Rating: Reduce | Target: Rs 3,370  We believe TCS and other Tier-I IT companies will continue to deliver strong revenue momentum over the four-six quarters (translating into double-digit revenue growth) and thus would sustain current valuations of 25x-30x, which implies 3x on PEG basis.  Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 3,250  The company has consistently maintained its market leadership and shown best-in-class execution. This gives the company room to increase its margin, while demonstrating industry-leading return ratios.  We have left our estimates unchanged as we have factored in double-digit growth for the company in FY22E.  JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Raised to Rs 3,640  The Q4 earnings were a class act in balancing unexpected growth with profitability. There was a secular growth across geographies and vendors with strong signing momentum.  With 1.5x book to bill and an 8 percent exit rate, the underwrite mid-teens growth in FY22. The management continues to target sustainable double-digit growth over the medium term. JPMorgan upgrades FY22-23 revenue estimates by 1-2 percent and EPS by 3-4 percent.  Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs  3,636  Our estimates largely remain unchanged for FY22/23E. We project revenue growth of 15.3 percent/11.5 percent in dollar terms for FY22/23E, respectively.  We believe TCS margin performance will sustain as 1) strong uptick in offshore delivery, 2) well-managed supply-side challenges—fresh hiring, reskilling, lower-wage inflation, lower attrition, 3) strong efficiencies in sales, deal transition and delivery with WFH, 4) structural cost-saving benefits (employee pyramid, travel costs, marketing costs etc).

TCS, in a statement, said the suite of modular, easy-to-deploy solutions streamlines every stage of the end-to-end testing and vaccination, enabling more individuals to get tested and vaccinated faster and return to normal life experiences.  Vaccination or test for COVID-19 involves a highly complex orchestration of multiple stakeholders from manufacturing to transportation, allocation to storage, distribution to scheduling, and reporting to monitoring.  There is an opportunity to provide a seamless process across the entire value chain to prevent issues that could slow down testing and vaccinations, TCS said.  Follow our LIVE blog for latest updates of the novel coronavirus pandemic  The suite leverages AI, robotics, blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT), as well as TCS’ extensive network of technology partners.  This suite transforms all five stages of testing and vaccination journeys: research and manufacture, allocation and transport, storage and distribution, scheduling and administering, and monitoring and re-opening.  It enables ecosystem participants at each of these stages to seamlessly share critical information among themselves while complying with privacy and consent regulations, and to scale up their operations so communities receive the required quantities of tests and vaccines, the statement said.  &quot;In designing its new solution suite, TCS emulated the example of successful retailers and other consumer-centric enterprises and adopted their proven, people-centric approach to optimising the testing and vaccination ecosystems,” it added.

During the meeting, the two sides discussed TCS' commitment to continue investing in the UK economy, innovation, technology sector, and in developing workforce skills.  The latest announcement builds on TCS' 45-year history in the UK.  “By partnering with some of the UK's largest corporations in their growth and transformation initiatives and helping them harness the power of emerging technologies to launch new innovative products and services, TCS has been an integral part of the UK economy's initiatives to remain globally competitive,” TCS said in a statement.

Truss, UK Secretary of State for International Trade, said deeper trading ties will create opportunities for UK businesses that were simply not there as part of the EU, and set the stage for a much closer partnership, ensuring more investors like TCS bring jobs and growth to the UK.  “We will be collaborating much more closely in the industries of tomorrow like science, tech and green growth, so we can build back better and deliver an export-led, investment-led, jobs-led recovery from coronavirus,” Truss added.

It prefers TCS on account of a strong business model, stable management, solid execution and strong free cash flows (FCF) generation.  As TCS is well-positioned to capitalise on ensuing opportunities created by COVID-19, its USD revenue and earnings would clock an 11 percent/15percent CAGR over FY2021-23E.

Hence, maintain a &quot;buy&quot; rating on TCS with a revised price target of Rs 3,590.  The key risks are rupee appreciation and/or adverse cross-currency movements and/or constraint in local talent supply in the US and a stringent visa regime.  Dolat Capital  Given quality commentary on multi-year transformation, and post the strong Q3 performance we have scaled up our growth estimates by 3 percent for both FY22/23 (0.7% for FY21). Also given a robust beat on OPM performance, we have upgraded our profitability estimates by 148/87/31bps for FY21/22/23E respectively. As a result, our earnings estimates for the company have increased by 7 percent each across FY21-23E.  We believe TCS and other Tier-I IT companies would continue to deliver strong revenue momentum over the next six-eight quarters (translating to double-digit revenue growth) and thus would sustain current valuations of 25x-30x which implies 3x on PEG basis. We value TCS at 30x (from 28times) on FY23E earnings of Rs 109.9 (earlier Rs 103) with a target price of Rs 3,300 per share (from Rs 2,950) and an unchanged rating of reduce.  ICICIdirect  Going forward, global digital technologies are expected to witness robust growth (around 15-20 percent CAGR in the next five years) led by robust growth in cloud, customer experience and robust growth in cloud-native technologies. Considering TCS’s digital prowess, coupled with market share gains via vendor consolidation, captive carve outs and increase in outsourcing, we expect TCS to register robust growth in revenues in coming years.

Motilal Oswal  We believe IT services have entered into a technology upcycle, led by cloud- and data-driven deals coming onto the market. Given TCS’ size, capabilities, and portfolio stretch, it is rightly positioned to leverage expected industry growth.  Additionally, TCS has consistently maintained its market leadership and shown best-in-class execution. This gives the company continued room to increase its margins, along with demonstrating industry-leading return ratios.  Motilal Oswal increases its EPS estimate for FY21/FY22/FY23E by 3 percent/4 percent/6 percent on account of a strong beat in 3Q.  While remaining positive on the company, it remains neutral given the rich multiples.

TCS reported strong 4.1 percent QoQ CC and  5.1 percent $ terms way ahead than ours and consensus estimates of 3 percent QoQ CC.  Margin expansion was driven by an increase in utilization rate, offshore shift and operational efficiencies.

Although margin may get impacted by wage revision.  &quot;We expect constant currency revenue growth of 2.7 percent QoQ and cross-currency tailwind of 50 bps on dollar revenue growth.

TCS,2021-01-05T09:15:50+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar, IT Q3 Preview: 3 stocks to bet on as robust QoQ topline growth likely with upward revision in full year...,"The deal pipeline is strong across companies led by digital foundation deals, integrated deals from smaller clients, experience transformation and even core transformation deals. ","IT services providers are expected to continue to report robust revenue growth in the third quarter of FY21 (October-December) as well, which is generally a seasonally weak quarter for the sector due to holiday season.  Recovery in key verticals, strong demand tailwinds, continued increase in digital spends especially after COVID-19, large deals ramp-up and lower-than-expected furloughs could help these IT companies show robust revenue growth in the range of 2-3 percent, while mid-tier IT services companies could report revenue growth in the range of 1.5-5.5 percent.  &quot;Healthy order pipeline, large deal signings, strong earnings from Accenture, and absence of headwinds like a repeat of the COVID-19 led lockdown in Q1FY21 or uncertainty with regard to the outcome of the US Presidential election should drive the outperformance in Q3 versus management guidance in Q2FY21,&quot; said Motilal Oswal.  &quot;Multiple mega-deal wins in Cloud and Captive (TCS – Postbank and Pramerica, Infosys – Rolls Royce and Daimler, and Wipro – METRO AG) should add incremental growth to an already buoyant organic growth momentum,&quot; the brokerage added.  The deal pipeline is strong across companies led by digital foundation deals, integrated deals from smaller clients, experience transformation and even core transformation deals. Hence total contract value (TCV) numbers will be robust for a few fuelled by mega and large deal wins, awards of contracts.  According to Kotak Institutional Equities, revenue growth for large companies could be in the range of 2-3 percent with Wipro leading the way. On a YoY comparison, &quot;Infosys and HCL Technologies will move to growth in constant currency, while TCS and Wipro will have marginal revenue decline. Mid-tier companies will report strong growth with L&amp;amp;T Infotech leading the way at 5.5 percent on a constant currency basis, Mindtree at 3.9 percent and Mphasis at 3.3 percent,&quot; the brokerage said.  Prabhudas Lilladher estimates revenue growth between 1.7-3.4 percent QoQ in constant currency for Tier-1 companies and 1.5-5 percent QoQ for Tier-2 companies.  Infosys and HCL Technologies are expected to review their full-year revenue growth guidance while Wipro is expected to forecast strong growth in Q4FY21.  &quot;We expect Infosys revenue guidance to increase 3-4 percent YoY in constant currency (from 2-3 percent) &amp;amp; EBIT margin guidance at 24-25 percent (from 23-24 percent). HCL Technologies current annual guidance stands at 0.5-1.3 percent for revenue growth and 20-21 percent for EBIT margin band. We expect revenue guidance to increase to 1-2 percent &amp;amp; slight revision in margin guidance,&quot; Prabhudas Lilladher said.  Wipro has given growth guidance of 1.5-3.5 percent for Q3FY21. &quot;We expect guidance for Q4FY21 to be strong 2-4 percent. This guidance does not include recent sign a large deal of Metro,&quot; said the brokerage.  As a result, the upgrade in earnings for FY21-FY22 estimates especially after December quarter results is likely to be seen.  &quot;We expect another round of upgrades, albeit marginal, in revenues estimates for FY22 post Q3FY21 results. The demand drivers are three-fold — 1&amp;gt; workplace management (It is realistic to expect that remote workplaces will continue with great emphasis placed on security, collaboration, scalability and automation), 2&amp;gt; customer experience will become paramount as online becomes the most relevant channel of interaction, and 3&amp;gt; the benefits of these changes are best utilised through core transformation,&quot; Kotak said.  Prabhudas Lilladher expects IT sector to maintain its strong performance in FY22 as 1&amp;gt; Sector has entered into Technology Upcycle, 2&amp;gt; Digital becoming mainstream, 3&amp;gt; Strong order book &amp;amp; deal pipeline, 4&amp;gt; Accelerated demand for cloud adoption, 5&amp;gt; Broad-based demand across all industry verticals.  On the operating front, the earnings before interest &amp;amp; tax (EBIT) margin is expected to be impacted only by the wage revision, otherwise, the cost measures may remain supportive.  &quot;TCS has rolled out wage increase effective October 1, impacting margins by -70 basis points QoQ. Wipro has rolled out promotions effective December 1, while HCL Technologies has given wage hike only for select bands. We would like to highlight that only wage hike is headwinds for margins in Q3FY21,&quot; said Prabhudas Lilladher, adding if companies are able to do cost control more efficiently there might be a positive surprise to the margin estimates.  Technology stocks had a strong run after the beginning of easing in lockdown measures. It was one of the best sectors in terms of return from March lows as well as in the last year.  The Nifty IT index rallied 55 percent in 2020 and 117 percent from March 23 low, against Nifty50 at 15 percent and 84 percent respectively in same periods. But brokerages still expect quality stocks among IT space to provide more returns in coming days.  In the largecap or Tier-I space, brokerages bet on Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies.  While the sector trades at 40 percent premium to its 10-year average multiple, Motilal Oswal remains positive as it expects the sector to sustain double-digit topline growth in the medium term, led by: 1 larger deals on a full-scale Digital transformation, 2) tail of projects steered by an increased focus on workplace management, and 3) higher spend on Cloud migration by large corporates.  Among Tier-I players, the brokerage likes Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies on expectations of industry-leading growth.  Infosys is also the top pick of Kotak which expects Infosys to lead the industry on growth in FY2022. &quot;Tech Mahindra is a play on margin expansion and 5G opportunities at reasonable valuations. Wipro has surprised with the urgency to turnaround effort and can be interesting. HCL Technologies continues to be a strong play on digital foundation deals and long-term growth potential in ERD,&quot; said the brokerage.

This is the third share buyback offer from the company after August 2018 and May 2017.  Experts advised investors to tender their shares in the buyback offer if they want to hold for less than one year period given the good price offered by the company.  &quot;We believe that investors with an investment horizon of less than one year can tender their share in the buyback as it is at a premium to current prices and given the fact that there would be no tax liability in the investor tendering their shares in the buyback,&quot; Jyoti Roy- DVP- Equity Strategist at Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.  The stock gained just 3.7 percent from the date of share buyback announcement till December 17, a day before the issue opening. But it already shot up 73 percent from March 19's low and gained 31 percent in the current year 2020 so far.  &quot;At current levels, the stock is trading at a significant premium to other largecap IT companies like Infosys and HCL Technologies which would limit upsides from current levels in the near term despite good long term growth prospects. Moreover, the acceptance ratio is also expected to be low given wide retail ownership of the stock,&quot; Roy said.  Going by the past trends and historic data, TCS has given record-breaking compounded returns to every investor with an average 35-50 percent acceptance ratio.  Based on SEBI mandate that companies reserved 15 percent of the buyback for small shareholders with holdings of less than Rs 2 lakh as on the record date which means TCS has to buy Rs 2,400 crore from retail shareholders.  Based on the assumption, &quot;we expect TCS' buyback to have a healthy acceptance ratio in the range of 30-40 percent for retail investors. Considering the current market situation, we believe TCS buyback offers low risk and moderate returns to retail investors and hence we suggest retail investors to tender and participate in the buyback offer,&quot; Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities said.  The buyback is proposed to be made under the tender offer route, and is open to all eligible shareholders of the company holding equity shares either in physical or electronic form, as on the record date - November 28.  TCS is providing a 5.7 percent returns through buyback offer as on December 17 closing.  The IT company in its offer document said the offer price represented a premium of 29.89 percent and 29.27 percent to the volume-weighted average market price of the equity share on BSE and NSE, respectively, during the three months preceding October 4, 2020, being the date of intimation to the stock exchanges of the date of the board meeting to consider the proposal of the buyback, and a premium of 18.92 percent and 18.88 percent over the closing price of the equity share on BSE and NSE, respectively, as on October 1, 2020, being the last trading date prior to the intimation date.  The current buyback is in line with the company's shareholder-friendly capital allocation practice of returning excess cash to shareholders, thereby increasing shareholder value in the longer term, and improving the return on equity.

TCS,2020-10-19T14:10:14+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Experts bullish on these 3 IT stocks; advise buying on dips,"Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors said the robust results posted by IT companies were ahead of their estimates given the increased demand for digital services in the times of COVID-19. ","The September quarter earnings announced so far by IT majors have been decent and impressive with strong deal wins and better operational performance.  The companies did not see any major impact of lockdown, though there were supply constraint issues initially. Consequently, expectations of strong growth in IT companies' earnings going ahead along with growing demand for digital services and share buybacks by TCS and Wipro pushed stocks prices higher in the last several months.  The Nifty IT index shot up 93 percent from March 23's closing low, surpassing the Pharma index to become the biggest gainer among sectors. IT stocks have exhibited strong price performance since announcing their Q1 FY21 results on the basis of a favourable business environment.  &quot;Largecap IT stocks have showcased decent performance in the on-going quarter. Dollar revenue growth in Q2 FY21 has been impressive on a sequential basis in the range of 3-7 percent. Good deal wins positively impacted the dollar growth while operational improvements and work from home have helped companies to post decent margins during the quarter,&quot; Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.  Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors said the robust results posted by IT companies were ahead of their estimates given the increased demand for digital services in the times of COVID-19.  &quot;Most of the companies have reported 20 percent YoY growth during their Q2 FY21 results and have mostly done better than our expectations. Pandemic has given the extra push for the adoption of newer technologies like cloud and digital,&quot; she said.  &quot;On the one hand, order pipeline looks robust giving visibility for stable earnings growth going forward and on the other hand, internal parameters like attrition, utiliSation, offshore-onsite mix, overheads, and other expenses have improved benefitting the margin.&quot;  While Infosys, HCL Technologies and TCS posted a good set of numbers for the quarter with sequential dollar revenue growth of 7.2 percent, 6.1 percent and 6.4 percent respectively, Wipro and Mindtree posted relatively subdued revenue growth numbers at 3.7 percent and 3.1 percent.  Hi-tech, life sciences, retail and CPG verticals led the rebound in growth followed by financial services and manufacturing. Verticals like Aerospace, travel tourism &amp;amp; hospitality continued to remain weak.  &quot;Another trend which we witnessed was strong growth in continental Europe relative to the US given that it was the first geography which came out of lockdowns. Moreover, recovery is being led by accelerated adoption of digital technologies rather than traditional services. Due to the pandemic, there is also greater preference for offshoring which will be beneficial to Indian IT services companies given higher margins,&quot; Jyoti Roy, DVP - Equity Strategist at Angel Broking said.  Positive Stance on IT Space  Experts overall are positive on the IT space given the expected growth in longer-term. They have advised buying IT majors on every correction and are unanimously bullish on TCS, Infosys and HCL Technologies. Although, these stocks are trading at higher valuations, they added.  &quot;While IT companies may be trading at higher multiples relative to recent historical average we believe that the sector is getting re-rated given strong growth outlook for most companies over the next few years due to faster adoption of digital technologies,&quot; Jyoti Roy said.  However, the growth trajectory will not be the same for all companies, he feels. &quot;Companies that have a large share of revenues from digital services along with greater exposure to high growth sectors will deliver industry-beating growth rates and will continue to outperform. On the other hand, companies with large exposure to troubled verticals or lower share of revenues from digital services will underperform the sector,&quot; he explained.  Therefore, he believes that investors should hold on to IT stocks given strong growth potential and revenue visibility for the sector. Investors who do not have any exposure to the sector or are underweight can use the current correction post the numbers to buy into the sector. He advised with a positive stance on TCS, Infosys and HCL Technologies.  Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research, Narnolia Financial Advisors said earnings growth ahead and stable margin make these stocks suitable to hold.  &quot;We are recommending fresh buying on any decline that may come as the third quarter is usually a soft quarter for IT stocks. We continue to like - Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata Elxsi.  Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research said their pecking order in IT space is Infosys, Cyient, TCS, Mindtree, HCL Technologies and Wipro.  The overall performance of the IT companies, market sentiments and prevalent market conditions makes this sector a good one to invest in for a medium-term time horizon, he believes.  The December quarter is generally a weak quarter for IT players, hence experts will closely watch the valuations which are currently high.  &quot;Q3 is generally a weak quarter for IT players, but if demand sustains and if there is good traction in key verticals, we might see the valuation to sustain in the long run,&quot; said Vinod Nair who is positive on TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Technologies.

It is expected to see sequential decline in Q2FY21 reported profit due to provision in EPIC legal case, but adjusted bottomline may grow in double digit QoQ.  The ramp up of large deals is likely to boost dollar revenue growth in the range of 2.5-3 percent and constant currency revenue growth could be in the range of 4.5-5 percent for the quarter ended September 2020, compared to previous quarter (Q1) which was impacted by supply-side constraints.  &quot;We expect constant currency revenue growth of 2.8 percent QoQ and cross-currency tailwind of 180 bps on dollar revenue growth. Growth would be driven by absence of supply-side constraints, ramp-up of large deals, and recovery in BFSI, CPG, and communication verticals. Lifescience and healthcare vertical is expected to continue its growth momentum, while retail vertical continues to remain weak owing to higher store closures in the US,&quot; said Sharekhan.  Among brokerages, Dolat Capital expects the maximum growth of 3.1 percent in constant currency revenue QoQ, in view of recovery of billing lost due to supply side impact (135bps) and conversion of robust deal wins (TTM TCV/revenue at 1.3x) to revenue.  The earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin is expected to grow in the range of 150-185 basis points QoQ in Q2FY21 due to revenue growth, cost control measures and improved utilisation rate, which ultimately may drive double-digit profit growth sequentially.  KR Choksey expects EBIT margin to rise 169bps QoQ on revenue growth, cost control, which will drive adjusted profit growth (13.7 percent QoQ on adjusted basis). &quot;Including a one-time exceptional item of Rs 1,218 crore due to provision in the EPIC legal case being currently fought by TCS, reported PAT is likely to decline 3.7 percent QoQ,&quot; the brokerage said.

Introduced in 2018, NQT last year saw more than 3.6 lakh students participating from over 2,600 colleges.  &quot;NQT will now be a common gateway test for several participating corporates for their fresher recruitment programmes. This standardised test will provide candidates with access to open positions at multiple corporates giving millions of young jobseekers an opportunity to work for India’s top corporates,” TCS iON Global Head Venguswamy Ramaswamy told PTI.  It will provide subscribing corporates with a well-rounded evaluation of candidates’ abilities, and access to quality talent across the nation at speed and scale, he added.  &quot;A large number of leading corporates including Croma, Titan, Kirloskar and Godrej have shown interest in participating in this hiring process,” Ramaswamy said.  Besides, the company is also in touch with small businesses across 600 cities in India so that students from these locations can get the NQT score and smaller enterprises can hire local talent, he added.  Young professionals with up to two years of experience, as well as students from any stream, currently enrolled in pre-final/final year of undergraduate or postgraduate programs can apply for the test.  &quot;The test acts as a single window for job opportunities across leading organisations in IT, BFSI, manufacturing, pharma, and FMCG sectors, including TCS,” Ramaswamy said.  In view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, TCS iON will allow candidates take the test from their homes.  To ensure inclusion, candidates without access to the necessary infrastructure at home also have the option of taking the test from a TCS iON centre.  There are 600 such centres from where the students can take the test, and depending on the applications, the centres will be prepared to ensure that social distancing and sanitation protocols are followed.  The test will focus on general abilities covering verbal, numerical and reasoning abilities to arrive at the normalised NQT score that can be presented to corporates as a demonstration of the candidate’s cognitive abilities.  A subject NQT, focused on programming, is also being planned keeping in mind the huge demand for this skill in the IT industry.  TCS iON intends to continuously improve the test design to provide employers with a better understanding of candidates’ abilities.  The NQT will be conducted every quarter and the score will be valid for two years.  The first test, which will be available for free, will be held from October 24-26.

Experts remained positive on the sector as a whole given the expected growth in coming years, but in the short term, they see limited room for upside in stock prices especially after stellar run seen since lockdown.  &quot;During last three-month period most institutions increased their weightage in the sector by around 180bps on average basis in last three months. Weightage on IT stocks is now just below 150bps compared with BSE500 (12 percent) as against Underweight of about around 300bps as of May 31,&quot; Dolat Capital said.  &quot;However, with IT Index now at 20 percent higher than pre-COVID levels despite average earnings compression of about 7 percent (for FY22) for our coverage universe implies expansion in earnings multiple by around 35 percent during this period. This re-rating has taken the valuations of stocks closer/higher than its +2SD of its 3-year Median PER,&quot; it added.  Hence, at these valuations, the brokerage sees limited room for further material upsides. Rather, it believes that the elevated valuations make them vulnerable to the potential risks of second order impact on the earnings and thus would prefer to wait for better entry points in these names.  At this point, Dolat Capital just sees a few names that have some more room for re-rating led by improved financial performance (across growth/OPM/FCF/Pay-out yield basis) expectations over next FY20-22E such as HCL Technologies (improving free cash flow-FCF to drive re rating – target Rs 795), Oracle Financial Services Software (acceleration in demand in Post COVID environment – DCF based target Rs 4,000) and Firstsource Solutions (US Mortgage revival led growth opportunities – target Rs 85).  HDFC Securities' top picks are Infosys (Buy, Target Rs 1,075), HCL Technologies (Buy, Target Rs 770), L&amp;amp;T Infotech (Add, Target Rs 2,750), Mphasis (Buy, Target Rs 1,450) and Sonata Software (Buy, Target Rs 370).  &quot;Despite the recent re-rating in the sector (one-year fwd reached +2SD), reverse DCF based on current price implies: (1) TCS/Infosys growth at 6.9/6.7 percent over FY23-30 and HCL Technologies/Wipro/Tech Mahindra growth at a modest 5.1/4.4/5.8 percent and (2) Mphasis appears most attractive with implied growth of -0.6 percent over FY23-30,&quot; said the brokerage.  &quot;Persistent Systems and Tata Elxsi are candidates for a higher payout, based on the disconnect between current efficiencies and high cash. Upgrades include TCS (Add), Persistent Systems (Add) and Cyient (Add),&quot; it added.  HDFC Securities maintained its positive outlook on IT sector despite the sector recently re-rating to +2-standard deviations (SD) valuations, as the centre of gravity is expanding beyond just the tier-1s, as mid-tiers are showing symmetry in balance sheet metrics (and reverting to growth premium).  The brokerage believes that the sector is poised for higher multiples, led by (1) the longevity of high-growth period (current valuations imply around 5 percent 10-year CAGR) with 'multi-year’ growth tailwind from the economic crisis, (2) the continuity of high (increasing) payouts, and (3) global ‘best in class metrics’ across growth, free cash generation, and balance sheet strength.  As per HDFC Securities' assessment of management discussion and analysis (MD&amp;amp;A), (1) the demand is expected to increase for services around digital channels, collaboration and workplace transformation; (2) pipeline is expanding in areas of cloud, workplace transformation, cost efficiency and automation; (3) companies have adopted remote management of upstream processes such as solutioning, requirements workshop and service transitions are done virtually without impact on productivity, leading to on track contractual commitments and go-live dates.

TCS,2020-08-21T14:19:54+05:30,Swathi Moorthy," Explained | Why does TCS have to pay $140 million to EPIC Systems, what are its options and other...","TCS, found guilty of trade-secret theft, says it is exploring its options as there is no evidence to back the US-based company's charges.   "," A US appeals court has upheld the trade-secret theft verdict against India’s largest IT company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) along with the compensatory damages of $140 million awarded to American medical software firm Epic Systems.  The US Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit, Chicago, however, said $280 million in punitive damages was excessive and asked the trial court to reassess it, TCS said in a regulatory filing on August 20.  Punitive damages are awarded as punishment to the defendant, TCS in the case, and compensatory damages are awarded as a benefit to the plaintiff— here Epic Systems—to help them cover the cost.  What is the lawsuit about?  Epic System filed the lawsuit in 2014 but the relationship between the two companies goes back further.  Epic Systems had hired TCS to test its healthcare management system it was implementing for Kaiser Permanente, an American healthcare company.  Epic Systems alleged that TCS staff used a KP employee's credentials to steal more than 6,000 documents that contained its development information. A TCS whistleblower alerted KP and Epic about the alleged theft of intellectual property.  In 2014, Epic Systems took TCS to court.  What happened in the lawsuit?  In 2016, a lower court in Wisconsin found TCS guilty and slapped $940 million in damages. This was later brought down the sum to $420 million to comply with the legal limit on punitive damages. According to legal websites, in Wisconsin, punitive damages are limited to two times the compensatory damages or $200,000, whichever is the higher.  TCS challenged the order in the Chicago appeals court, which upheld the guilty verdict but reduced the penalty.  “The court held that the punitive damages award of $280 million is constitutionally excessive and directed the trial court to reassess the punitive damages. The court upheld the compensatory damages award of $140 million,” TCS told the Bombay Stock Exchange on August 20  The company was exploring its options as there was no evidence of misuse of Epic’s information by TCS, it said.  &quot;TCS believes that the evidence presented in the trial court doesn't support the charges made against it, and will vigorously defend itself in the relevant court,&quot; the company told Moneycontrol.  What next?  The case is likely to go back to Wisconsin district court, where the case was first filed, said a source.  Since the trial court will now have to look into $280 million punitive damages as directed by the appellate court.  TCS can also appeal to the larger bench in the same court or the US supreme court, the source said.  Has TCS faced similar complaints?  Yes. After Epic, TCS faced two more trade-secret theft lawsuits.  In a case filed in 2018, Simonelli Innovation Inc accused the IT major of wrongful and improper use of its intellectual property and trade secrets to build its consulting practice. The case was dismissed.  TCS faced yet another lawsuit from another US-based tech firm in 2019. CSC accused the Indian company of improperly accessing its proprietary code to build an insurance platform for the American market.  Responding to the allegations, TCS told the court that the lawsuit lacked evidence and was aimed at disrupting its $2-billion business deal with Transamerica. The case is still being heard.  Have there been other cases of intellectual property theft?   In 2007, erstwhile Satyam Computer Services Limited, which is now Mahindra Satyam, settled an IP infringement lawsuit filed by UPaid, which offered solutions for payments via mobile phone, for $70 million.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/explained-why-does-tcs-have-to-pay-140-million-to-epic-systems-what-are-its-options-and-other-questions-answered-5737411.html

This comes after TCS appealed the 2016 lawsuit verdict in the US federal appeals court, where the company was first penalised $940 million in damages. This was later brought down to $420 million.

Epic systems had restricted TCS access to consultants, which limits TCS’ access to Epic's documents.

Going forward, global digital technologies is expected to witness robust growth (CAGR of ~20% CAGR over next five years) mainly led by business going digital and increase in work from home scenario.

Revenue in cc terms fell 6.9% QoQ/6.3% YoY, leading to a 150 bps QoQ drop in EBIT margins despite benefits from INR depreciation, lower SG&amp;amp;A and travel expenses and other cost rationalization measures. Revenue decline was contained in Financial Services (-2.2% QoQ cc, along expected lines) and Hi-Tech (-3.4% QoQ cc), although performance was weak in Manufacturing, Telecom and Retail. Among regions, UK and India were the most impacted. The order book at US$6.9bn (vs. US$8.9bn QoQ/US$5.7bn YoY) appeared resilient, given the macro. Management highlighted that it benefitted from the closure of large deals already being negotiated over the prior months. The pipeline is robust in areas like Cloud Migration, Remote Enablement and Security, said management.

The Sensex rallied over 400 points and the Nifty closed above 10,800 levels","It is the last day of the week and it does look like bulls will remain in control for the fifth consecutive week in a row.  The Sensex quickly recouped the losses seen on July 8 thanks to positive global cues. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address at the India Global Week 2020 lifted sentiment further. He said India was already seeing green shoots when it comes to economic recovery.  The broader markets underperformed while the benchmark indices put up a smart show by rallying over a percent each. The Sensex rallied by more than 400 points and the Nifty closed above 10,800 levels.  “Indian equities followed Asian markets as positive economic data from China boosted sentiment. A rise in Chinese iron ore futures and steel prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange boosted metal stocks in India,” Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.  Experts told Moneycontrol that the momentum remains strong, but further price action is likely to be guided by the number of fresh COVID-19 infections, and management commentary after the June quarter earnings.  Investors are advised to trade light as the trend could reverse or we could see profit-taking near the 200 Daily Moving Average (DMA), which is placed near 10,900 levels, a technical analyst said.  A similar sentiment was echoed by Khemka. He too advised traders to remain stock specific and look at booking profits at regular intervals.

It has rallied over 50 percent after hitting a bottom of Rs 1,494 in March.  Recently, the counter broke above Rs 2,132 levels, which happens to be the previous tops on the short-term chart. Now, the level of Rs 2,132 has become a strong support for the short-term, a technical analyst said.  “TCS has been facing strong resistance in the Rs 2,200-2,250 zone for the previous five quarters. In Q2 FY21, the stock has shown some sign of breaking out of this upper band of Rs 2,250,” Vinay Rajani, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol.  Experts told Moneycontrol that it is still a strong technical buy, hence, any dip in the stock post the result could be used to buy. Rajani added that TCS is looking bullish on all technical parameters and the stock should continue to do well in the coming quarters. &quot;So, every dip should be considered as a buying opportunity by investors.&quot;  Nifty technical outlook for Friday: The Nifty formed a bullish candle on the daily chart on July 8. It closed above the crucial resistance level of 10,800, but 10,900 is likely to be a tough level to breach, experts told Moneycontrol.

Deal wins remained robust at $6.9 billion in Q1 against $8.9 billion in March quarter and against the average of $6.8 billion in the last four quarters.  On the operating front, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) declined 9.7 percent QoQ to Rs 9,048 crore and margin fell 148 bps to 23.61 percent, which both were below CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of Rs 9,442 crore and 24.34 percent, respectively.  On the year-on-year basis, EBIT was down 1.8 percent, but margin expanded 231 bps for the quarter.  &quot;TCS numbers missed estimates and the numbers paint a grim picture. Retail continue to getting challenging, but BFSI surprised. Only worry is the depreciation in dollar, which is a reality and that could takeaways some gains,&quot; Prakash Diwan of Altamount Capital told CNBC-TV18.  BFSI was the only segment registered sequential growth, rising half a percent QoQ to Rs 15,282 crore, but others segments reported a decline.  Revenue from manufacturing segment declined 7.9 percent sequentially to Rs 3,884 crore. The same for retail and consumer business fell 11.5 percent to Rs 5,912 crore. Communication, media and technology saw a 3.8 percent QoQ decline in revenue to Rs 6,495 crore. Others dropped 4.8 percent to Rs 6,749 crore in the June quarter.  Gopinathan said the BFSI would recover in the second half of FY21 and Europe would get back to growth through the course of the year.  TCS has declared an interim dividend of Rs 5 per equity share at the end of the June quarter.  The stock gained 14 percent in the June quarter and rose 3.6 percent year-to-date to trade around its highest level, while the Nifty IT index was up 15.6 percent during the quarter and down 6 percent year-to-date.

Brokerages largely expect a 5.5 percent sequential decline in the company's constant currency revenue for the quarter.  The cross-currency headwinds could be 40-50 bps, hence the dollar revenue may fall 5.9-6 percent QoQ due to worldwide lockdown that hit travel, transportation, retail, auto, energy and manufacturing segments, though financial and life sciences sectors will be stable.  &quot;Sharp pullback in spending among directly impacted verticals of travel, transportation, retail (apparel and department stores) and autos will lead to a revenue decline. We expect relatively stable performance in the financial services vertical. Ramp up of large deals will limit the impact on overall revenues,&quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities. It sees 5.4 percent QoQ fall in the constant currency revenue and 6 percent in the dollar revenue.  Overall, profit is expected to decline in the range of 2-4 percent on the back of lower revenue and weak operating performance.

Find all earning related news here &quot;EBIT margin is expected to decline by 43 bps QoQ and an improvement of 51 bps YoY. Margin headwinds during the quarter will be lower utilisation, pricing pressure, and pressure in legacy business, which will be partially mitigated by currency tailwind, lower travel expenses, and cut in variable compensation payouts,&quot; said Sharekhan, which sees net profit falling by 2.9 percent sequentially during the quarter. Deal wins are expected to be sharply lower because of the supply-side pressure in the first half of the quarter due to lockdowns imposed by several countries, followed by easing in the second half of the June quarter. TCS had reported a total contract value (TCV) of $8.9 billion in Q4FY20. Commentary on large deal wins and deal pipeline, trends across verticals, pricing pressure and margin trajectory, long-term trends in IT services spending, changes in delivery model will be key things to watch out for. &quot;Commentary on back-ended recovery in revenue growth remains key.

TCS,2020-07-07T11:01:39+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,These 2 IT stocks are up 38% from March lows but experts still bullish on them,"Experts upbeat on Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, though the lockdown and its effect on sectors like hospitality, travel and retail will have an impact on their earnings in the short to medium term.","  The IT sector has continued to trade in line with equity benchmarks, as the segment has escaped the worst of the coronavirus-triggered lockdowns across the world. As businesses make the digital shift and work from home becomes the new normal, IT companies can hope for a good run.  Industry leader Accenture's stronger-than-expected results and commentary also set an encouraging tone for the upcoming earnings season for the Indian IT sector.  The US software consulting company reported better-than-expected earnings, with new bookings rising 4 percent to $11 billion in the third quarter ended May 31. The company, however, did reduce 2020 revenue forecast to 3.5-4.5 percent from 3-6 percent earlier.  &quot;Point to note that majority of the IT companies, which get outsourcing business, did not face significant cancellations or pricing pressure from global clientele. Work from home (WFH) transition was smooth and had very little revenue impact,&quot; said Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities. Accenture's results and commentary bodes well for Indian IT sector, he said.  The Nifty IT index has gained 38 percent from its lows in March against more than 41 percent gains reported by Nifty50, while IT major TCS rallied 38 percent and rival Infosys was up 45 percent.  Experts remain bullish on both Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys, though the lockdown and severely affected sectors like hospitality, travel, retail, etc will have some impact on their earnings in short to medium term.  &quot;Technology stocks have always been in vogue, as they have generated returns consistently, and have less cyclicality. Also, in bear markets and stress times, investors prefer parking their funds with large tech companies as a defensive bet,&quot; Sumit Bilgaiyan, founder of Equity99 said.  “Investing in companies like TCS and Infosys is like investing in dollar with better returns. I think it will continue to generate greater returns in future.”  Tapse is also optimistic about both the companies.  &quot;Technology is a sector which turned well in the pandemic scenario as the whole world is running on digital technology platforms. Industry data says spends on digital transformation would increase, offset by lesser spend on running operations and the cost saved, which will be invested back into digital transformation of business going forward. Reacting to the fundamental development, the Technology index outperformed well,&quot; he said.  After the March quarter results, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said the company's earnings would be back to Q3FY20 levels in Q3FY21, which means the COVID-19 crisis could impact first half of FY21.  The risk could be US President Donald Trump’s move to support his job segment, but there, too, Indian companies are hiring locals, say experts.  &quot;While the risk comes in as Trump issued a proclamation to suspend issuing H-1B visas and other work visas for the rest of the year. The proclamation is expected to impact a large number of Indian IT professionals and several American and Indian companies who were issued H-1B visas by the US government for the fiscal year 2021, beginning October 1. As a result, IT counters can see it as a concern,&quot; Tapse said.  TCS and Infosys are expected to show 5-6 percent sequential decline in constant currency revenue for the quarter ended June 2020, the first quarter where the full impact of lockdown and re-opening of economies will be seen.  Most analysts don’t expect these companies to give full year guidance but their deal pipelines, pricing pressure during lockdown, deal, changes in delivery model and trends across verticals will be key things to watch out.

TCS,2020-07-03T13:51:09+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,COVID-19 to dent IT earnings in Q1FY21 but these 2 stocks remain top picks,Brokerages say the demand pullback is expected to be severe in the directly impacted segments but BFSI and telecom could be stable in terms of growth for IT companies.,"The June quarter earnings of information technology (IT) companies are expected to be hit by demand-side challenges as well as supply pressure, as the coronavirus outbreak takes a toll on the business.  The lockdown imposed to check the spread of the virus hit the supply side. Though some countries started easing restrictions and lifting lockdown in May but IT firms could not operate at full capacities due to the virus risk, which forced companies to lower discretionary spend, review pricing, delay the ramp up of deals and acquisition, which will spill into September quarter as well, brokerages say.  Brokerages expect IT companies to report a 5-9 percent sequential decline in constant currency revenue for the June quarter, with cross-currency headwind of 20-70 basis points, which may further impact dollar revenue growth QoQ.  &quot;We expect Tier-1 IT companies to report a revenue decline in the range of 5-8 percent QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms. This, coupled with cross currency headwind of 30-60 bps, will further negatively impact dollar revenue growth,&quot; said ICICI Securities.  Kotak Institutional Equities expects a sequential revenue decline of 5-9 percent and sequential cross-currency headwind of 20-70 bps largely from INR/USD movements.  According to them, country's largest IT services providers TCS and Infosys are expected to report more than 5 percent QoQ decline in revenue.  Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies are likely to see around 8-9 percent sequential fall in the topline but L&amp;amp;T Infotech may be best among them as well as midcaps, reporting 4.5-5 percent decline in revenue QoQ.  The demand pullback is expected to be severe in directly impacted segments but BFSI and telecom could be stable in terms of growth for IT companies.  &quot;Directly impacted segments of travel, transportation, hospitality, retail (department stores and apparels) pulled back spending with magnitude of cut varying from 20-40 percent,&quot; said Kotak. The impact of these cuts would be visible through June and September quarters, it said, adding it expected a sharp revenue decline in the oil and gas segment.  It also expects a moderate revenue decline in banking and stable revenues in insurance and telecom verticals.  In addition, ICICI Securities says, companies with higher BPO revenues are also expected to be impacted by supply-related challenges and lower client approval for work from home mode.  &quot;Headwinds are higher than tailwinds before a decision on variable compensation. Companies have anywhere between 3-4 percent of revenues tied to variable compensation; the extent of flex on this will determine margins,&quot; Kotak said. An 8 percent decline in revenues can lead to 3-4 percent hit on utilization and 120-150 bps impact on margin (assuming relatively lower hit to onsite utilization) and (3) operating leverage hit due to revenue decline, it said.  ICICI Securities expects margin of Tier 1 companies to decline around 32-200 bps while among Tier 2 companies NIIT and Tech Mahindra are expected to post a margin decline of around 161-200 bps.  &quot;This is mainly due to a dip in utilisation, pricing pressure and cross currency headwind, partially offset by rupee depreciation, lower travel cost and lower general administrative cost,&quot; ICICI Securities said.  More or less Kotak's expectations with respect to margins are along similar lines.  Brokerages say IT companies may continue to avoid giving full-year guidance, given the uncertainty due to coronavirus but they expect a revival in the second half of FY21 and strong growth in FY22.  &quot;While the pandemic is expected to impact near-term growth, we expect a revival in H2FY21. This, coupled with increased traction in digital technologies, vendor consolidation opportunity for Indian IT players, improved IT spending bodes well from a long-term growth perspective,&quot; ICICI Securities said.  Kotak said it expected a weak FY21 but FY22 revenue growth would be as high as double digits on the back of spending on core transformation programs, vendor consolidation again for offshore pure plays and pickup in IT spending. “We expect TCS and Infosys to capitalise on this growth opportunity,&quot; it said.  Stock picks  ICICI Securities prefers Infosys among Tier-1 and L&amp;amp;T Infotech among midcaps. Kotak said Infosys is its top pick while L&amp;amp;T Infotech is a solid compounding play in the mid-tier category.  &quot;We would wait for a better entry point for TCS. Even as we expect HCL Technologies to report weak near-term financials, we believe that its IT services portfolio of business has a long runway for growth. Tech Mahindra is inexpensive,&quot; Kotak said.  Disclaimer: The above report is compiled from information available on public platforms.

TCS WaferWise automatically detects defects, improves product quality, drives up throughput, and enhances business growth, the company said in a statement.  The solution harnesses the company's contextual knowledge of the semiconductor industry and the power of deep learning technology, to help chipmakers digitally re-imagine their product quality assurance process, it said.  Sophisticated quality inspection of wafers during the semiconductor manufacturing process is essential to detect and classify defects early and accurately, as well as improve quality, TCS said. Several companies still run manual inspections that rely heavily on human expertise.  This makes the process prone to errors and limits manufacturing throughput.

TCS was selected by Israel's Ministry of Finance to transform its banking sector by building a banking service bureau that would serve as a shared, plug-and-play, digital banking operations platform – powered by the TCS BaNCS Global Banking Platform - to help start-up banks launch their operations very quickly, the company said in a press release.  &quot;This initiative is seen as a bid to boost competition in the financial services sector, spark greater innovation and enhance customer experience by democratising access to banking in Israel by making financial services accessible to the consumer,&quot; the release said.  &quot;It will serve as an online financial superstore through which an ecosystem of providers of services and products, such as insurance and credit cards, can reach out to the new generation of digital natives,&quot; it added.  The yet to be named digital bank is the first to receive a banking license in Israel in over 40 years and is to be launched in 2021.  The fully digital bank will have no physical branches and will provide Israeli citizens with all the services that regular brick and mortar banks offer, including credit, deposits, loans, account management, securities trading and processing.  The new bank will also have access to all of Bank of Israel's liquidity tools and various payment systems.  “We have achieved a key milestone in the Israeli financial services industry by being onboarded on to TCS' Banking Services Bureau. This approach will reduce the cost of banking for the average citizen and foster the development of innovative and differentiated services,&quot; Shouky Oren, the Chairman of the new bank, was quoted as saying.  TCS is uniquely positioned to deliver these services due to its market ready and industry leading TCS BaNCS Global Banking Platform as well as its ecosystem integration, Oren noted.  The TCS BaNCS Global Banking Platform, also available in a SaaS (system-as-a-service) model, is an integrated Israel-ready suite that helps banks and financial institutions offer innovative products and services to customers throughout their life journeys, based on their anticipated requirements and over the devices of their choice.

It reported a consolidated profit of Rs 8,049 crore for Q4 FY20, down 0.85 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis due to lower other income and higher finance cost. For FY20, profits grew by 2.76 percent to Rs 32,340 crore on a revenue of Rs 1,56,949 crore, up 7.16 percent year-on-year.  Click here for more details.  Terming the last two weeks of March as &quot;both a challenge and opportunity,&quot; Rajesh Gopinathan, its CEO and MD, said the pandemic completely reversed the positive momentum that TCS had started seeing in some of our biggest verticals in the first half of Q4.  Also read: TCS Q4: IT bellwether posts lacklustre numbers; 8 key takeaways  Speaking on the quarter gone by, Gopinathan said TCS went from an integrated delivery model to a dispersed delivery model. &quot;In the new operational model, more than 90 percent of TCS employees are able to work from home. Despite this, we maintained our execution capability and security processes.&quot; The ability to seamlessly operate is one of the biggest positive takeaway from this phase, he added.

However, Gopinathan laid all employee fears to rest, stating that he does not see any form of retrenchment. “Currently, the company is not looking at furloughs,” he said.  He did mention that TCS will not offer any salary increments at this point in time, but added: &quot;Promotions will happen depending on business performance.&quot;  TCS, he said, will honour all 40,000 offers made on campus, adding that the company will bring them onboard from Q2 and Q3.  The company had given out its highest ever placement offers in five years in Q1 FY20 at 30,000. For the quarter ending March 31, the company had made a net addition of 1,789 offers.

The company is closely monitoring the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) service vertical where they saw some tightening of its budget from the business of the year. Despite that, the company saw strong deal closures distributed across verticals and geography. This quarter, the company closed $1.8 billion TCV. The company added 20 new logos in BFSI.  For all earnings related news - Click Here  In the short term, the resultant deflation is pulling down TCS' growth in the BFSI segment. However, in seven quarters, it grew materially by 200 percentage points relative to the market share of top six providers. This gives confidence over TCS' position to continue to participate in the demand turnaround in the medium to long term.

Global brokerage firm UBS has a neutral call on TCS with a target price of Rs 2,300 and cited that the revenue miss adds evidence to demand slowdown.  Morgan Stanley has maintained an 'equal-weight' view on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 1,980, underscoring that the Q2 revenue growth, margin and PAT was below estimate.  The global financial firm added that double-digit growth for FY20 is clearly unachievable. &quot;We cut estimates as the second half of FY20 looks tough and management has low visibility,&quot; Morgan Stanley said.    Jefferies has a buy call on the stock but the brokerage has cut the target price to Rs 2,300 from Rs 2,500 earlier, citing that the weak Q2 signals a single-digit growth in FY20.  The brokerage cut its year-on-year (YoY) constant currency (CC) growth estimate to 8.4 percent and trimmed margin estimate as well to 24.3 percent to reflect a weak first half of FY20.  FY20-22 earnings per share (EPS) estimate was cut by 4-6 percent by the brokerage.  Nevertheless, Jefferies believes the IT major will outperform tier-I peers on growth and margin in the medium-term.  &quot;Weak results could provide good entry opportunity into a strong long-term franchise,&quot; said the brokerage.  Citi has maintained a sell call with a target price of Rs 1,870.  &quot;We lower our estimates further by 2 percent for FY20/21/22 and lower the target multiple to 21 times from 22 times, given growth and profitability challenges,&quot; Citi said.  The global financial firm said a 4 percent EPS CAGR target over FY19-21 against a 24 percent in FY19 will create near-term pressure.  Credit Suisse has maintained a neutral call on TCS, cutting the target price to Rs 1,930 from Rs 2,070. The global brokerage said TCS failed to recoup margin sequentially after a wage hike in Q1.  However, it added that the overall deal wins remained strong at $6.4 billion which is up 30 percent YoY.  Credit Suisse has trim revenue estimates by 1 percent and EPS estimates by 5-7 percent adding that the company has a high-quality franchise but is not immune to an uncertain environment.  Among the domestic brokerage firms, Axis Capital has a reduce call on TCS, with a target price of Rs 1,940.  The brokerage has cut FY20/21 US dollar revenue estimates by 2.2 percent and 3.4 percent respectively while cutting margin by 100 bps and 110 bps, respectively.  EPS estimate was also lowered by 5 percent and 6 percent.  &quot;Sales engine continues with robust deal participation, resulting in strong deal wins. But challenges on margin front have been the bigger negative surprise. We remain watchful on growth momentum over FY19-21,&quot; said Axis Capital.  Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a neutral call on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,000.  The domestic brokerage firm has downgraded the operational earnings estimate by 2-4 percent and said that the growth performance this quarter only dampens the FY20 growth prospects further.  As per the brokerage, EBIT margin contraction of 250bp YoY is a reflection of high pressure on earnings growth. However, margins are likely to recover to an extent because of normalization of utilization.  &quot;Demand outlook for the medium term remains healthy considering strong deal wins. We expect US dollar revenue and EPS CAGR of 7 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, over FY19-21,&quot; said Motilal Oswal.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/brokerages-cut-target-price-revise-estimates-for-tcs-after-a-dull-q2-show-4523141.html

Here are some key takeaways from the company's Q2 scorecard:  Growth  With an increase of 5.7 percent, revenue from operations stood at Rs 38,977 crore in the September quarter of FY20 against Rs 36,864 crore in the same quarter of the previous year.  &quot;Revenue growth was led by life sciences and healthcare (up 16 percent) and communications and media (up 11.8 percent). All the other verticals - BFSI (up 8 percent), manufacturing (up 7.8 percent), technology and services (up 5.6 percent) and retail and CPG (up 4.8 percent) - continued to grow,&quot; the company said.  Constant-currency revenue grew 8·.4 percent YoY while digital revenue grew 27.9 percent YoY.  UK (up 13.3 percent YoY) and Europe (up 16 percent YoY) remained the driver of growth. North America and Asia Pacific grew 5.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively. Emerging markets showed steady growth - India (up 7.7 percent), MEA (up 7.3 percent) and Latin America (up 7.3 percent).  Lacklustre operating performance  On the operating performance front, TCS' earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the quarter at Rs 9,361 crore declined 4.2 percent year-on-year and margin contracted 250bps YoY to 24 percent, missing analyst estimates of Rs 9,834 crore and 25 percent respectively.  Net profit increased about 2 percent YoY to Rs 8,042 crore in Q2FY20 against Rs 7,901 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.  Guidance  The IT major is confident about its medium and longer-term growth.  &quot;We ended the quarter with steady growth despite increased volatility in the financial services and retail verticals.

Consolidated headcount stood at 450,738 as of September 30, 2019,&quot; said the company.

The growth was impacted by increased volatility in financial services and retail verticals and miss on margins front.  Profit in the June quarter stood at Rs 8,131 crore. However, the year-on-year growth was 1.78 percent in bottomline.  Revenue in rupee terms grew by 2.1 percent quarter-on-quarter (up 5.8 percent YoY) to Rs 38,977 crore in Q2FY20, the IT company said in its BSE filing.  &quot;We ended the quarter with steady growth despite increased volatility in the financial services and retail verticals. We remain confident as the medium and longer term demand for our services continues to be very strong, as evidenced by Q2 order book at $6.4 billion, the highest in the last six quarters,&quot; Rajesh Gopinathan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, said.  The company showed a 0.6 percent sequential growth in dollar revenue at $5,517 million in Q2 and the year-on-year growth was 5.8 percent.  The biggest concern was a slow down in constant currency revenue growth at 8.4 percent (YoY) in Q2FY20 after reporting double digit growth in previous four quarters, which clearly reflected in key segments.  Digital revenue growth dropped to 28 percent in Q2, from 40 percent in previous quarter though its contribution to total revenue increased to 33.2 percent from 32.20 percent QoQ.  BFSI segment registered a 8 percent growth (YoY) in constant currency against 9.2 percent in previous quarter (but higher against 6.1 percent in Q2FY19) while retail &amp;amp; CPG sector growth was 4.8 percent against 8.4 percent QoQ and 15.6 percent in Q2FY19.  &quot;We are seeing softness in larger banks in North America &amp;amp; UK and capital markets. The retail recovery has been pushed back. So we don't have a clear viability on when Retail and BFSI will see a recovery,&quot; TCS management in a conference said, adding the company should be able to break into double digit growth in couple of quarters.  The country's largest software services provider's earnings missed analyst expectations on all parameters. Profit was expected at Rs 8,322 crore on revenue of Rs 39,285 crore for the quarter, according to a poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18.  The company declared a total dividend of Rs 45 per share for the quarter, including a special dividend of Rs 40 for the first time since 2014.  On the operating performance front, TCS' earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the quarter at Rs 9,361 crore declined 4.2 percent year-on-year and margin contracted 250bps YoY to 24 percent, the lowest in nine quarters, missing analyst estimates of Rs 9,834 crore and 25 percent respectively.  Sequentially the margin declined 15 bps from 24.15 percent in June quarter as company continued to invest in building capacity.  &quot;Our margins in Q2 reflect our continued investments in our people, and in building the capacity we need to fulfill our strong order book,&quot; V Ramakrishnan, Chief Financial Officer said.

Shares of TCS fell more than 1 percent in intraday trade on July 10.  The country's largest software services firm reported 10.8 percent YoY growth in consolidated net profit to Rs 8,131 crore for the quarter ended June 30. The revenue of the Mumbai-based firm grew 11.4 percent YoY to Rs 38,172 crore in the June 2019 quarter.  Digital revenue, which accounted for about one-third of the top line, grew 42.1 percent in the said quarter over the previous year.  Reacting to the results, Credit Suisse maintained its neutral rating but slashed target price to Rs 2,000 from Rs 2,130 earlier. The near-term commentary has turned cautious.  TCS is likely to miss its 26-28 percent margin band once again this year. The global investment bank has moderated FY20/FY21 growth estimate by ~150 bps, and slashed EPS estimates by 2-4 percent.  Another brokerage firm CLSA maintained its buy call on TCS but slashed its target price to Rs 2,570 from Rs 2,650 earlier.  TCS Q1 reported a miss on the revenue and margins, but deal wins and the outlook remain strong. The constant currency growth stood at 10.6 percent YoY, however, the company missed margins due to supply pressure.  The IT major is well-positioned to exploit scale digital transformation adoption. CLSA slashed FY20-22 EPS by 3 percent.  Here’s what other global brokerage firms recommend for TCS post Q1 results:  Morgan Stanley: Equal-Weight| Target: Rs 1,980  Morgan Stanley maintained its equal-weight call on TCS with a target of Rs 1,980. The Q1 revenue growth was weaker-than-expected, it said.  However, Q2 will be the key to achieving management’s goal of sustaining double-digit constant currency growth in FY20. The global investment bank sees downside risks to street estimates.  HSBC: Hold| Target: Rs 1,900  HSBC maintained its hold rating on TCS with a target price of Rs 1,900. Growth slowed in Q1, despite strong deal wins, and due to a cyclical slowdown.  The long-term outlook remains positive. There is a significant macro slowdown and currency appreciation are key downside risks, said a note by HSBC.

Prabhudas Lilladher expects EBIT margins to decline around 90bps on account of wage hike, INR appreciation and visa cost.
