HDFC,2024-05-06T14:01:59+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,Banking Central | Big banks brush aside tech alerts until RBI cracks the whip,Banks need to scale up investment in strengthening the technology before launching products to ensure their platforms can handle volume without inconveniencing the customer. Repeated glitches will distance even the loyal customers from a bank and prompt them to look for better options,"The RBI crackdown on Kotak Mahindra Bank last week didn't come as a bolt from the blue. The action didn't really surprise the insiders too.  The regulator had conducted IT checks on the bank in 2022 and again in 2023 before issuing corrective action plans. Going by the statement issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the continued failure on part of the private sector lender to address the concerns raised by the watchdog in a comprehensive and timely manner had resulted in the action last week.  Put it simply, the central bank waited for two years before cracking the whip, because the bank failed to comply with the guidelines. For the new chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank, the RBI action has come as the first big challenge since he took over following the exit of bank's founder Uday Kotak from an executive role.  Even in the case of HDFC Bank back in December 2020, the RBI action had barely triggered frowns. There were frequent engagements between the    regulator and the bank in the one-and-a-half years preceding the RBI action when the lender had reported frequent digital outages causing inconvenience to customers. This too was a major challenge for then a new-comer, Sashidhar Jagdishan, who had just taken the baton from Aditya Puri. In HDFC Bank, too, the issue was inaction or inadequate action by the private lender during the Puri days in addressing its perpetual tech issues.  Yet another case—though not directly comparable with KMB and HDFC Bank—is the RBI action on Paytm Payments Bank Ltd (PPBL) early this year. Among the problems cited by the RBI, one of the issues was inadequate compliance in the way the bank carried out the functions of the Paytm App and drawing a line between the parent and the bank in terms of operations.  PPBL’s dependence on the IT infrastructure of OCL remained absolute and there was no operational segregation. Many transactions were routed through the parent entity-owned apps, raising serious concerns on data privacy and data sharing, the RBI found during its inspections. In Paytm case, too, the RBI had been talking to PPBL for two-and-a-half years about the non-compliance but the company didn't take any action.  In all three cases of RBI crackdown on Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank and Paytm Payments Bank, one factor stands common - the regulator gave sufficient time each of the entities to rectify the tech-related issues, but all of them had shrugged off the warnings.  But why are the banks failing to get their tech game right, again and again?  The fact is while the banks went on an overdrive to launch digital products, they did not invest enough to firm up and upgrade their technology platforms. The RBI has taken the lapses seriously. Technology has helped banking services evolve to the tech-age, but for the banking services to become more inclusive, the lenders need to make sure the alternative channels work seamlessly. Considering the significant growth in number and value of digital transactions over the last few years, they need to invest in technology.  The advancement in technology, the rise in digital payment apps, and the ease of digital banking have sent online transactions zooming across the country. Just to understand it better, transactions through the unified payments interface (UPI) platform crossed 100 billion in 2023 alone to close at 118 billion, shows data shared by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). This marks a 60 percent growth from 74 billion UPI transactions recorded a year back.  Also, most banks have significantly shifted their business acquisitions through digital channels. In case of Kotak Bank, as per latest data, Kotak 811 has emerged as a a critical division in its operations, accounting for nearly 95 percent personal loan disbursals, 99 percent credit card sales, and 79 percent new businesses.  But, while the banks relied increasingly on digital channels, they did not upgrade their systems to handle such spiralling business volumes, which inexorably paved way for a spurt in glitches. The banks downplayed the technical glitches as routine occurrences, but the RBI refused to buy the argument. The regulator kept on reiterating that the banks need to scale up investment in strengthening the technology before launching products to ensure their platforms could handle the volume without causing inconvenience to the customer.  For some reason, the banks seem to have ignored the wake-up call from the RBI for long. Now, after the whip if cracked, it’s high time for the banks to go for a course correction.

Insiders recalled him as a tough boss, evoking a love me or hate me kind of feeling, driving his team extremely hard to stay focussed and be on top of the game. Prior to joining HDFC Bank in 1995, he was with Citibank where he worked with Aditya Puri.  At HDFC Bank, he was one of Puri’s blue-eyed boys. A graduate from the National Defence Academy, Aima’s entry into banking was serendipity, as his sitting height came in the way of his flying, forcing him to switch careers.  Nilesh Shah, Managing Director, Kotak AMC describes Aima as the Bhishma Pitamah of private banking in India with market knowledge better than most fund managers. &quot;I will miss Abhay whom I can truly call a friend, a mentor and a guide,&quot; Shah told Moneycontrol.  Recounting one of his initial meetings with Aima, Shah remembered being tested on his conviction. &quot;Once he was convinced, he supported the fund, even if there were setbacks,&quot; Shah recounts.  For Shah, his connection moved from professional to personal when he and his wife Parul were introduced to the Isha Foundation by Aima. &quot;We discovered a different Abhay. A spiritual Abhay. Our interaction became from professional to personal, from business to universal, and from market to spiritual,&quot; he added.  In a post on social media platform X, Pankaj Razdan, former Executive Vice Chairman &amp;amp; MD Edelweiss Wealth and former MD &amp;amp; CEO - Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance remembered Aima as a friend, mentor and brother.  &quot;He was my buddy I could talk and discuss anything.

Abhay Aima, April 17th, 1961- April 27th, 2024. RIP.”  Responding to Drabu,  Razdan added, &quot;I remember every minute of our time with Abhay. We laughed, joked, argued and summed up with a great Kashmiri meal prepared by you Haseeb. Memories that will always remain with me as most precious.&quot;  Another HDFC Bank veteran who has worked closely with Aima for over 17 years, Nitin Rao, CEO, InCred Wealth describes Aima as a &quot;maverick, a cowboy, a fearless hero, and a generous soul.&quot; Rao also believes that he was a perfectionist who was always grounded, and constantly reminded everyone of the importance of being humble and respectful.  Rao remembers Aima often giving his views on the market and managing portfolios and not once over 17 years ever going wrong. &quot;All of us held him in awe for the market positioning and his market views,&quot; Rao remembers.  Calling the veteran fearless, Rao remembers there have been many occasions where in HDFC Bank, he would challenge conventional views, even if it meant going against the standard grain of thought, even with the senior most leaders.  &quot;His view was always taken seriously and respected. Many views were shocking when they were given, but they always would turn out kind of right and focused for the organisation,&quot; he remembers.

The core NIMs for the quarter stood at 3.44%, a decline of 66 bps YoY but improved by 4 bps QoQ. NII was in line with our estimates. Pre-Provision Operating Profits (PPOP) grew 57.2% YoY/ 23.8% QoQ to INR 292,742 Mn, with operating income increasing by 47.3% YoY/ 19.3% QoQ. PPOP was 2.4% lower than our estimates. Net profit for Q4FY24 stood at INR 165,119 Mn, a surge of 37.1% YoY/ 0.9% QoQ despite higher provisions. This was led by healthy growth in operating profits and few write-back adjustments of taxes. The net profit for the quarter was 12.7% lower than our estimates, led by the higher provisions. As of March 31, 2024, advances were reported at INR 24,848,615 Mn, a growth of 55.2% YoY and 1.6% QoQ. The deposit grew by 26.4% YoY and 7.5% QoQ to INR 23,797,863 Mn, with the CASA ratio at 38.2% as against 44.4% a year ago (vs 37.7% as of December 31, 2023). Outlook We have assigned an Adj P/B multiple of 2.0x (earlier 2.2x) on the FY26E Adj Book value for the core banking business, resulting in a target price of INR 1,714 per share (earlier INR 1,950), an upside of 13.7% over the CMP.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

HDFC,2024-04-23T09:12:27+05:30,Moneycontrol News,HDFC Bank: A look at how financials evolved in last 6 years,HDFC Bank's earnings growth is likely to rebound as margins are expected to expand gradually as the bank replaces market borrowings with low-cost deposits.," HDFC Bank reported in-line earnings for the quarter ended March 2024. Although the lender has done well to recover its net interest income after the pandemic, analysts say that the falling net interest margin (NIM) remains a concern. In the medium to long term, the private bank's earnings growth is likely to rebound as margins are expected to expand gradually as the bank replaces market borrowings with low-cost deposits.   HDFC Bank's margins have remained under pressure since the merger as the lender incorporated low-yield home loan products from parent HDFC into its balance sheet. The bank is gradually recouping the margins as it substitutes the high-cost borrowings with deposits and the changing loan mix towards retail over the next couple of quarters.   HDFC Bank's CASA has faltered as the entire sector faces challengers in mobilising low-cost deposits. Depositors are putting money into capital market securities, instead of low-yielding savings bank deposits. HDFC Bank is among lenders trying to woo depositors by offering multiple benefits with savings accounts.   HDFC Bank's net interest income growth has been steadily recovering from post-Covid lows riding on continuous loan growth. In the aftermath of Covid, the lender's NII growth fell to 11. However, it almost doubled in the subsequent year as advance registered robust growth. In FY24, the growth rose to nearly 25 percent.   HDFC Bank's advance growth has remained robust since it recovered from the Covid blues. However, recently the lender has intentionally slowed its advance growth to prioritise improving its deposit base, which has seen an improvement sequentially.   HDFC Bank's asset quality deteriorated as its non-performing housing loans surged on account of more prudent delinquency recognition by the bank as compared with the erstwhile HDFC. However, the lender is expected to overcome this merger overhang gradually, according to analysts.   HDFC Bank has bolstered floating provisions and hence total floating and contingent provisions stood healthy in FY24. The bank does not expect to revoke the floating provision in the near future, and it would help the lender strengthen its balance sheet and ensure that it is protected from any unanticipated movements, according to analysts.

HDFCB utilized HDFC Credila’s stake sale gains of Rs73bn and tax reversal due to favorable court order to shore-up contingent provision buffer (over Rs109bn QoQ) to 1.1% of loans. However, higher staff cost due to ex-gratia provision led to a 3% PAT miss at Rs165bn. Going forward, as per management, ramping up retail deposits and margin management amid potential pressure from lower incremental LDR/inorganic PSL build-up (from Oct-25) to meet sub-targets will take precedence over credit growth.

Adjusting for one-time ex-gratia of Rs15bn, core PPoP beat PLe by 3.7% led by better fee income and controlled opex. Credila stake sale gains of Rs73.4bn and tax write-back of Rs38.2bn were utilized to create floating provisions of Rs109bn. Contingent and floating provisions as at FY24 end stood at 110bps of net loans which is best-in-class and comparable to ICICIB (109bps).

PAT (adj. for one-offs) and NII both stood in line with our estimates. The bank prudently deployed the stake sale gains from Credila (INR73.4b) and tax credit to further strengthen the balance sheet as it made floating provisions of INR109b during the quarter. Opex jumped as the bank made INR15b of staff ex-gratia provisions; however, the adjusted C/I ratio stood at 41.3%. Outlook HDFCB reported in-line adjusted earnings in 4Q, characterized by margin, CD ratio and LCR improvement. Loan growth was modest as the corporate book saw a decline, while growth in retail and CRB remained healthy. Asset quality ratios stood stable, while PCR declined marginally to 74%. The bank has bolstered floating provisions and hence total floating and contingent provisions stand at healthy 1.1%. The bank refrained from giving any specific growth guidance as it is focusing on improving its CD ratio and replacing HDFC borrowings, which are coming to maturity. The gradual retirement of high-cost borrowings, along with an improvement in operating leverage, will boost return ratios over the coming years. We estimate HDFCB to deliver a steady 18% CAGR in deposits and sustain a 13.5% CAGR in loans over FY24-26. We thus estimate HDFCB to deliver an FY26 RoA/RoE of 1.9%/15.5%.

HDFC,2024-04-22T11:01:18+05:30,Lovisha Darad,"HDFC Bank ticks all the right boxes in Q4; margin, deposit growth to drive re-rating: Analysts","HDFC Bank has largely ticked all the right boxes in Q4, delivering better-than-expected deposit growth, positively surprising on margins, and seeing a rebound in its liquidity coverage ratio.","HDFC Bank reported healthy March-quarter financials (Q4FY24) after missing out on several fronts in Q3. The private lender has largely ticked all the right boxes in Q4, delivering better-than-expected deposit growth, positively surprising on margins, and seeing a rebound in its liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). This has made brokerages issue bullish calls on the lender and bump up their respective target prices.  Although HDFC Bank's stock has dropped by more than 10 percent this year, and underperformed the Nifty 50 index, which went up by 3 percent, analysts are happy with its Q4 performance. Unlike before, when there were some problems due to the HDFC merger, this time, things look good for the bank, they said. HDFC Bank shares slipped 0.6 percent to Rs 1,521 per share in April 22 morning deals.  LDR ratio improves as deposit growth outpaces loans  Jefferies maintained a 'buy' rating on HDFC Bank and raised the target price to Rs 1,880 per share, noting that deposit growth was strong at 17 percent in Q4FY24. The brokerage believes that loan growth lagged at 12 percent in the quarter ended March as the management has been working on margin expansion and moderating its loan-to-deposit ratio.  ALSO READ: HDFC Bank Q4 results: Key highlights from the earnings report  HDFC Bank's loan-to-deposit ratio fell to 104 percent in Q4FY24 from 110 percent in Q3FY24. Ideally, a loan-to-deposit ratio of 80-90 percent is considered healthy for a bank, as long as it can meet its liquidity requirements.  Motilal Oswal, too, shared a 'buy' rating for HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 1,950 per share, forecasting 13.5 percent/18 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in loans/deposits over FY24-26.  Lower borrowings to improve HDFC Bank's RoA, RoE  HDFC Bank's deposits grew 7.5 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ) in Q4FY24, outpacing 1.6 percent QoQ loan growth in Q3FY24, with the corporate segment seeing a decline.  The management had earlier indicated that it expects deposit growth to outpace loan growth by 300-400 bps over the medium term. However, during the Q4FY24 earnings call, the management explicitly refrained from issuing any guidance or retaining the guidance shared earlier.  With a gradual reduction in borrowings, analysts at ICICI Securities upgraded HDFC Bank to 'buy' from 'add' with a target price of Rs 1,850 per share. The brokerage anticipates a gradual re-rating on sustained deposit growth and expects the bank to deliver a healthy return on assets (RoA) of nearly 1.7 percent for FY25/26 with a 14-15 percent return on equity (RoE).  ALSO READ: HDFC Bank Board declares dividend of Rs 19.5 per share for FY24  Margin expansion will boost profitability, say analysts  Another key positive in the lender's Q4 scorecard was the gradual improvement in margins. HDFC Bank's core net interest margin (NIMs) improved by 4 basis points (bps) QoQ to 3.44 percent in Q4FY24 from 3.40 percent in Q3FY24 amid stability in its cost of funds.  Going ahead, analysts at Nomura expect the bank to build a gradual improvement in its margin trajectory as the management prioritises profitability over growth. The brokerage has put a 'neutral' call on HDFC Bank and raised its target price to Rs 1,660 per share from Rs 1,625 per share.  Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said that the bank is taking the right steps on slowing down loan growth and shifting its focus to improving the NIM through better loan pricing and/or improving the liability mix. They maintained a 'buy' rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,750 per share.  HDFC Bank reported flattish sequential net profit growth to Rs 16,611 crore in Q4FY24 due to the rise in provisions, while transaction sales from the HDFC Credila stake sale helped accrue net revenue to Rs 47,240 crore.

This is around 20 percent of our total provisioning,” Vaidyanathan said at a post-result press conference on April 20.  On more investments to AIFs, Vaidyanathan said that investments will depend as and when opportunities come.  Earlier, the lender had made a 100 percent contingent provision on its AIF investments. &quot;Our AIF book is Rs 1,220 crore and the current applicable Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular asks us to take a provision on that and by January 18. On a prudent basis, we have done the assessment and taken the provision now.

As per the clarification, the definition of downstream investments will exclude investments in equity shares of the debtor company of the lender. However, the rules will apply to all other investments, including investments in hybrid instruments.  Further, provisioning by lenders that have investments in AIFs will be required only to the extent of investment by the lender in the AIF scheme which is further invested by the AIF in the debtor company, and not on the entire investment of the RE in the AIF scheme, RBI said.  Also, investments by lenders in AIFs through intermediaries such as fund of funds or mutual funds are not included in the scope of the earlier RBI circular, RBI said.  These rules have been brought in with a view to ensuring uniformity in implementation among the lenders and to address the concerns flagged in various representations received from stakeholders, the RBI said.  December 19 rule  On December 19, 2023, the RBI barred regulated entities, such as banks, non-bank lenders, and home financiers, from investing in AIFs that have directly or indirectly invested in companies that have borrowed money from the lenders.  In a press release, RBI highlighted regulatory concerns regarding certain transactions involving AIFs by regulated entities that have come to its notice and released guidelines for investments in AIFs by the lenders regulated by it. “These transactions entail substitution of direct loan exposure of REs to borrowers, with indirect exposure through investments in units of AIFs,” the RBI said. The guidelines, RBI said, have been introduced to address concerns about potential evergreening through this route.

The RBI said lenders need to liquidate their investment in the scheme within 30 days of the AIF scheme, in which lenders are already investors, and make a downstream investment in any such debtor company, the RBI said.  Further, if lenders have already invested in schemes having downstream investment in their debtor companies as on date, the 30-day period for liquidation shall be counted from the date of issuance of this circular, the RBI added. If lenders fail to liquidate their investments within 30 days, they need to make 100 percent provision on such investments, RBI said.  The central bank also said that investment by REs in the subordinated units of any AIF scheme with a &quot;priority distribution model&quot; shall be subject to full deduction from RE’s capital funds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hdfc-bank-wrote-back-rs-200-crore-on-aif-provisions-post-rbi-clarification-says-cfo-12682861.html

HDFC,2024-04-19T15:41:06+05:30,Shaleen Agrawal,HDFC Bank Q4 preview: Focus on deposits to keep margins steady but income growth may drag,The lender moderated loan growth in Q4 in favour of a strong focus on deposit mobilisation. Exceptional income will also likely bolster quarterly earnings in a challenging environment.,"HDFC Bank may have to contend with a low single-digit revenue growth in Q4 FY24, given India’s largest private lender focuses on mobilising deposits to keep margins steady rather than growing advances.  HDFC Bank’s January-March net interest income is expected to grow by 1.8 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 29,172 crore, according to the median estimate of eight brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.  However, the bank’s operating income, measured by operating profit before provisions, is likely to see a healthy growth of 22.4 percent on a quarterly basis to Rs 28,925 crore, primarily helped by treasury gains and the sale of a stake in HDFC Credila, the lender's education loans wing.    The slow advance growth, low loan to deposit ratio and continued pressure on net interest margins will likely weigh on HDFC Bank’s net profit for the three months to March, limiting the quarter-on-quarter gain to a modest 3.1 percent to Rs 16,577 crore, according to the consensus estimate.  ALSO READ: Jefferies retains 'buy' rating on HDFC Bank, foresees over 20% upsurge  On the other hand, a few brokerages note that the exceptional gain from selling a majority shareholding in Credila may bolster the bank’s net profit. HDFC Bank’s year-on-year financial results are not comparable due to the merger with the parent entity Housing Development Finance Corporation during the year.  HDFC Bank stock is down nearly 10% so far this year since January, after the sharp fall post the previous quarter results. The bank's Q3 earnings had disappointed investors with compression in net interest margins, and challenges becoming apparent in growing the loan book.  Strategic shift to mobilising deposits   According to Axis Securities, HDFC Bank has intentionally slowed its advances growth to prioritise improving its deposit base, which has seen an improvement sequentially. This would presumably stabilise the bank's margins.  Further, a healthy pre-provision operating profit growth will be helped by a stable operational expense ratio and contributions from non-interest income, particularly from the stake sale in subsidiary Credila.  Prabhudas Lilladher analysts noted that HDFC Bank's loan growth is expected to be modest at 1.6 percent quarter-over-quarter, led primarily by its retail and commercial and rural banking (CRB) portfolios. However, the brokerage anticipates a 12 basis point decline in net interest margin due to a sharp fall in the loan-to-deposit ratio.  One-time gains and asset quality to provide support  Emkay Research and ICICI Securities both highlight the positive impact of one-off gains from the Credila stake sale. These gains, along with some reversal of provisions from alternate investment funds (AIFs), are expected to significantly enhance the bank's profitability.  Furthermore, Dolat Capital suggests that these factors, combined with an expected stable net interest margin of about 3.4 percent, will contribute positively to the bank's bottom line.  Asset quality is anticipated to remain robust, with the gross non-performing asset ratio holding steady at 1.25 percent. Provisions are likely to see a moderation, benefiting from likely write-backs in AIF provisions, adding another layer of support to earnings.  Sector-wide challenges remain, some may weigh  The banking sector overall, as noted by Elara Capital and JM Financial, faces headwinds that include margin pressure due to tight liquidity and continuous deposit pressure. Despite these challenges, the sector may look forward to lower credit costs and improved recovery trends soon in the upcoming quarters.  Kotak Securities said that HDFC Bank's focus on deposits, which are expected to grow about 7 percent quarter-on-quarter, aligns with strategies to have a cushion against these pressures.

For instance, if the lender's deposits record a 17-18 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), then loans can grow at 13 percent.  &quot;The improvement in net interest margins (NIMs) is key to a rise in return on asset (RoA) and re-rating of valuations,&quot; the brokerage firm said.

HDFC,2024-04-05T12:59:54+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,RBI MPC | Experts list top 10 rate-sensitive stocks as RBI keeps repo unchanged,"The market turned volatile at 22,500 as it priced in the non-event. Once the index closes above 22,600, one can expect a march towards 22,700-22,800.","The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent for the seventh time in a row on April 5. This was on expected lines as most economists and market experts feel the interest rate cut is likely to start only after similar action by the US Federal Reserve.  The US central bank indicated three rate cuts this year with experts expecting the first one around end of June or early second half of 2024.  The Reserve Bank of India also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target of 4 percent within a band of +/- 2 percent, while supporting growth.  The domestic economy sees a strong momentum with growth in FY25 pegged at 7 percent with Q1FY25 at 7.1 percent, while the global economy showed resilience and is likely to maintain a steady growth in 2024, the RBI said.  With the hope of normal monsoon this year and continuing food price uncertainties along with rising oil prices (Brent crude futures traded at $91 a barrel, up 11 percent in last one month), geo-political tensions and volatility in financial markets, the central bank expects the CPI inflation at 4.9 percent in Q1FY25 and 3.8 percent in Q2FY25, while the last reading was 5.1 percent in January-February (softening from 5.7 percent in December 2023) and core inflation at 3.3 percent in February as against 3.6 percent in January.  &quot;Projections of real GDP growth for FY24-25 at 7 percent and CPI inflation at 4.5 percent for the year along with strong manufacturing and services PMI numbers and healthy corporate and banking balance sheet instills confidence of the resilience of Indian economy,&quot; Raghvendra Nath, MD at Ladderup Wealth Management said, adding if rural demand strengthens and there are no adverse surprises in inflation from food or crude oil prices, private consumption is expected to rise, further aiding the growth trajectory.  However, he feels the timing and extent of rate cuts remain dependent on announcement by global central banks and the CPI aligning with RBI’s 4 percent target on a sustained basis.  The market turned volatile around 22,500 on the Nifty 50 as it seems to have priced in the non-event. Now, the all focus will be on the corporate earnings that will start next week, and in case the index gives a strong close above 22,600, then the further march towards 22,700-22,800 area is likely on cards, with support at 22,300, experts said.  &quot;The RBI MPC meet has become a non-event for the market as everything was on expected lines with no new surprises,&quot; Sheersham Gupta, director and senior technical analyst at Rupeezy, said. He maintained a mild bullish stance for the Nifty, especially the financials, for the short to medium term.  On the upside, the immediate resistance for the Nifty stands at 22,600 and, if surpassed, the index may potentially reach levels around 22,750, he feels.  The rate-sensitive stocks were mixed with the Bank Nifty rising 0.4 percent and Realty index jumping 1.5 percent, but Auto was down third of a percent at the time of writing this article.  Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 rate sensitive stocks from experts with a 3-4-week perspective. The stock price of April 4 is considered for the calculation of returns:  Expert: Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,527.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 | Target: Rs 1,620 | Return: 6 percent  Recently, HDFC Bank experienced a significant upward movement following a period of consolidation between Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,475 and is now trading above Rs 1,530. Moreover, the daily stochastic indicator has shown a bullish reversal from just above the oversold threshold of 25, indicating positive momentum.  This breakout is further supported by substantial trading volume. Additionally, the stock closed above the weekly R5 resistance camarilla Pivot (Rs 1,487.9), suggesting continued bullish sentiment. Consequently, we recommend traders/investors to consider buying within Rs 1,500-1,530 range, targeting Rs 1,620, with a stop-loss placed near Rs 1,465 on a daily closing basis.    AU Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 621 | Stop-Loss: Rs 568 | Target: Rs 720 | Return: 16 percent  AU Small Finance Bank reached a peak around Rs 813 on January 8, 2024, but then experienced a decline of approximately 32 percent. However, in the past two weeks, the stock has shown a significant recovery and is currently trading near Rs 620 mark, indicating a bullish sentiment.  On the indicator side, the weekly Scale Stochastics indicator has identified a &quot;hidden Bull Divergence&quot; close to its previous low point recorded on March 20, 2023 (as shown on the chart). This divergence suggests the possibility of upward momentum and indicates a potential bullish sentiment.  Therefore, investors may consider adding long positions in the range of Rs 600-625, with an upside target set at Rs 720. It's recommended to set a stop-loss near Rs 568 on a daily closing basis to manage risk.    Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,063 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025 | Target: Rs 1,130 | Return: 6 percent  Since peaking around Rs 1,130 mark on March 6, 2024, Axis Bank has undergone a significant downturn, experiencing a notable decline of approximately 9 percent. However, in the following six trading sessions, Axis Bank has shown resilience, avoiding further declines and instead consolidating within a range spanning from Rs 1,040 to Rs 1,080.  Interestingly, support is also evident near Rs 1,050 levels due to Fibonacci ratio clustering, and daily stochastics indicate a &quot;hidden Bull Divergence,&quot; adding to the bullish sentiment in the stock (refer to the chart).  Therefore, investors may contemplate adding long positions within Rs 1,050-1,070 range, with an upside target set at Rs 1,130. To manage risk, it is advisable to set a stop-loss near Rs 1,025 on a daily closing basis.    Expert: Ashish Kyal, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors  Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 607 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 670 | Return: 10 percent  As shown on the below chart, Canara Bank have shown an excellent rise and prices are moving precisely within the upward sloping channel. We have identified the 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) which has successfully supported rallies in the past and dips towards this average have acted as a great buying opportunity as major lows have formed near this average.  So as long as price holds above it, the trend is likely to remain bullish. Support as per this is near Rs 550 levels. Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has also shown bullish crossover which is acting as a double confirmation.  However, looking at the overall rise, buy on dips looks prudent strategy for better risk reward for the target of Rs 670 which is also a channel resistance as long as Rs 550 holds on the downside.    Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,410 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,195 | Target: Rs 3,150 | Return: 31 percent  In the previous session, Godrej Properties closed on a flat note. Stock is currently facing hurdle near previous swing high which is near Rs 2,540 levels. A decisive breakout above it can result into fresh rise in this stock.  Stock is following classic Elliott wave theory. Wherein, currently wave 5 of primary wave (3) is moving on the upside. As per guidelines wave 3 is considered as a strongest one. So further rise is expected in this stock once it breaches above Rs 2,540 level for the target of Rs 3,150 levels or higher. Key support is at Rs 2,195 levels.  LIC Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 644 | Stop-Loss: Rs 610 | Target: Rs 725 | Return: 13 percent  LIC Housing Finance is currently trading at important juncture. In previous session, there is minor rejection from the highs. Now acceptance back above Rs 661 followed by Rs 670 will indicate a strong positive breakout which will open the targets for Rs 725 levels.  Since March 21 not a single candle has given closed below previous day's low which keeps overall tone on the positive side. ADX (average directional index) is showing readings of 27 suggesting that momentum is picking up.  So, a breach above Rs 670 resistance level is must for further bullish momentum to continue with the target of Rs 725 level as long as Rs 610 holds on the downside.    Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, HOD - Research at GEPL Capital  City Union Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 154 | Stop-Loss: Rs 143 | Target: Rs 177 | Return: 15 percent  The City Union Bank weekly chart reveals a consolidation phase, with recent indications of a turnaround from a support zone, potentially marking a sustained reversal. This reversal is supported by increased volume participation, evident from the surge above the crucial 21-week average.  On the daily scale, the stock is establishing higher highs and higher lows, delineating a short-term uptrend that aligns with the broader timeframe.  Furthermore, City Union Bank is currently maintaining levels above key moving averages such as the 12-week and 26-week EMAs, signaling a trend improvement. The RSI above 60 and bullish crossovers further underscore the positive momentum.  Looking ahead, it's reasonable to anticipate continued upward movement in the stock, with a potential target price of Rs 177. It's advisable to set a stop-loss at Rs 143 on a closing basis to manage risk effectively.    Jana Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 467 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 542 | Return: 16 percent  JSFB (Jana Small Finance Bank) is displaying a consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the daily scale, indicating strong momentum and forming an IPO base as it approaches its all-time high.  Following a reversal candlestick on the weekly scale, the stock experienced a significant turnaround, reflecting positive sentiment and maintaining levels above the 12-day exponential moving average, signifying an improvement in trend.  Moreover, on the weekly timeframe, JSFB has demonstrated rapid retracement, with a four-week downtrend (from Rs 466 to Rs 368) being reversed in just two weeks, underscoring robust price action and signaling a potential upward trajectory.  Looking ahead, it is reasonable to anticipate that the upward movement will continue, potentially reaching Rs 542 level. It is advisable to set a stop-loss at Rs 430 on a closing basis to manage risk.  State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 759 | Stop-Loss: Rs 700 | Target: Rs 900 | Return: 19 percent  Since June 2020, SBI has demonstrated a strong price structure characterized by a rising trend. On the monthly scale, bullish price action has been evident, with the stock forming a Rally Base Rally pattern. Notably, in the prior month, a Doji candlestick has formed, suggesting a base, and indicating a potential rally ahead according to this price action pattern. On the weekly scale, February 2024 have shown polarity followed by impulse momentum, signaling a continuation of the upward trajectory.  SBI has consistently traded above important averages such as the 12-week and 26-week moving averages, indicating a positive trend. Additionally, the MACD study shows increasing values in the positive territory, further reinforcing the bullish momentum.  Furthermore, on the ratio chart of SBI against Nifty, polarity observed from the 2022 swing indicates a continuation of its outperformance.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 900. The bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 700 level.  Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, senior technical research analyst at HDFC Securities  HUDCO: Buy | LTP: Rs 207 | Stop-Loss: Rs 193 | Target: Rs 230 | Return: 11 percent  The weekly timeframe chart of this Housing &amp;amp; Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) indicates sharp upside bounce so far this week. After shifting in to a downward correction amidst larger range movement in the last couple of months, the stock price is currently in an attempt of decisive upside breakout of the said range around Rs 202-205 levels.  The stock price on the smaller timeframe has moved above the hurdle of down sloping trend line around Rs 198-200 levels. The volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication.  Buying can be initiated in HUDCO at CMP (Rs 207.15), add more on dips down to Rs 200, wait for the upside target of Rs 230 in the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stoploss of Rs 193.    Indiabulls Real Estate: Buy | LTP: Rs 135.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 125 | Target: Rs 149 | Return: 10 percent  After showing a downward correction with high volatility in the last 5-6 weeks, the real estate stock - Indiabulls Real Estate - has witnessed a sharp upmove so far this week. The bullish chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact as per weekly timeframe chart and present upmove in the stock price could be in line with new higher top of the sequence.

HDFC,2024-04-05T10:23:28+05:30,Hiral Thanawala,RBI Monetary Policy | RBI holds repo rate at 6.5%: No impact on home loan EMIs,For existing borrowers there are opportunities to switch lenders in the current scenario with several banks offering home loans starting around 8.5 percent. The new home loan borrowers should scout for banks offering loans with the narrowest possible spread. This will reduce the interest payable.,"Your home loan interest burden and equated monthly installments (EMI) will remain unchanged for now as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the repo rate steady at 6.5 percent for the seventh time in a row on April 5.  &quot;This move aims to keep inflation in check within the targeted range while sustaining market momentum,&quot; says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.com. He adds, the central bank's strategy reflects careful consideration of robust economic indicators, amidst factors such as monsoon performance, US federal decisions, and overall economic growth, ensuring continued high growth prospects for the country.  Since October 1, 2019, banks have linked floating-rate retail loans to an external benchmark, which is the repo rate in most cases. So, any changes in the repo rate directly influence the interest rates on these loans.  Wait for lower rates continues  &quot;A stable repo rate signals consistency in interest rates for borrowers, providing assurance to homebuyers regarding steady loan interest rates, beneficial for both new loans and existing ones with floating rates,&quot; says Shetty.  Existing borrowers will have to contend with higher interest rates for some more months, after which economists expect the inflation to cool to levels within the RBI's comfort zone, paving the way for reducing rates. Inflation continues to remain above the 4 percent target, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said on April 5.  Around 2021 and 2022, the lowest rates in the market were around 6.5 percent, when the repo rate was 4 percent, implying a spread of 2.5 percent over the repo rate. Those borrowers have the option of switching to other lenders who offer narrower spread and lower interest rates to save on interest costs.  New borrowers must scout for narrowest possible spread  This year, HDFC bank has effectively increased home loan rates by 35 basis points (bps) for new borrowers despite repo rates being steady. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. At HDFC Bank, the lowest interest rate on a Rs 50 lakh home loan was 8.35 percent in January, whereas at present, the lowest rate is 8.70 percent.  According to data on interest rates compiled by Paisabazaar, Axis Bank and Karur Vysya Bank have also raised their effective new home loan rates by 5 bps. In January, the lowest home loan rates at Axis Bank and Karur Vysya Bank for a Rs 50-lakh loan were 8.70 percent and 8.95 percent. From March, these rates went up to 8.75 percent at Axis Bank and 9 percent at Karur Vysya Bank.  Financial experts have attributed this rate hike to liquidity issues, which have affected not only HDFC Bank, but others as well.  So, new home loan borrowers should scout for banks offering loans with the narrowest possible spread. This will reduce the interest payable.  “Home loan borrowers should assess their financial capabilities and explore opportunities to secure favorable loan terms amidst this rate environment,” says Atul Monga, CEO and Co-founder, Basic home loan.  Also read: When taking home loan, make sure your down payment is high enough  Prepay to lower interest burden  You could also consider making part-prepayment of the loan out of your savings and investments. Just an extra few thousand every month can reduce your interest payout significantly over the long term.    A good strategy is to earmark a portion of your annual bonus to prepay your housing loan every year.  Switch the lender  There are opportunities to switch lenders in the current scenario with several banks offering home loans starting around 8.5 percent.  This is important for borrowers with government banks where a large percentage of loans continue to be on older benchmarks such as marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) and base rate where interest rates may be marginally higher compared to the repo-benchmarked loans we have today.  Refinancing with one’s own bank is simple and low-cost but can potentially save lakhs for borrowers.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/rbi-holds-repo-rate-at-6-5-no-impact-on-home-loan-emis-12578701.html

Dr Sundar Sankaran, program director at Aster Institute of Renal Transplantation, said that he tried blocking some of the numbers but the calls continued from several other numbers. He also said that after being tired of such spam calls, when he told off a loan requirement caller, another person who claimed to be the telecaller's manager called him up, demanding to know why the doctor was &quot;rude&quot;.  &quot;HDFC loan requirement callers have become a nuisance and if you get angry with them you are pestered with more calls despite blocking,&quot; Dr Sankaran wrote on X. &quot;Today after one caller got fired by me another caller claiming to be manager HDFC wanted to know why I was rude looked like spam calls but HDFC has to act and investigate.&quot;  HDFC loan requirement callers have become a nuisance and if you get angry with them you are pestered with more calls despite blocking Today after one caller got fired by me another caller claiming to be manager HDFC wanted to know why I was rude looked like spam calls but HDFC… — Sundar Sankaran (@sundar_s1955) March 30, 2024   Speaking to Moneycontrol, Dr Sankaran said, &quot;This is very troublesome when we are checking patients who are sick.

HDFC,2024-03-29T10:33:51+05:30,Hiral Thanawala,HDFC Bank raises new home loan rates even as repo rate stays steady. Here’s why,"This increase however, is applicable only to new loans sanctioned and not existing loans, which means that older borrowers will not be impacted by these hikes.","HDFC Bank, India's largest private sector lender, has increased its repo rate-linked home loan interest rates gradually since January this year.  The rates were increased even though the Reserve Bank of India has kept the repo rate unchanged since April last year. As the name suggests, repo rate-linked home loan rates should move in tandem with changes in the repo rate.  The increases (see graphic) apply only to newly sanctioned loans and not existing ones, which means older borrowers will not be affected.  The lowest interest rate on a Rs 50 lakh home loan was 8.35 percent in January, whereas at present, the lowest rate is 8.70 percent. So, in a span of three months, HDFC bank has effectively increased home loan rates by 35 basis points (bps). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  All retail loans sanctioned after October 1, 2019, are linked to an external benchmark, which, in the case of most banks, is the repo rate. Non-banking financial companies like HDFC, which was merged with HDFC Bank in July last year, however, do not have to adhere to the external benchmark regime.    Factors leading to increase in home loan rates  “HDFC Ltd was selling home loans aggressively at about the 8.30 percent to 8.45 percent range just a few months prior to the merger with HDFC Bank. Post-merger, HDFC Bank has been increasing the rates at portfolio level, citing a rise in cost of funds,” said Vipul Patel, founder of MortgageWorld, a loan consulting firm.  Raj Khosla, MD of MyMoneyMantra.com, attributed this to liquidity issues, which have affected not only HDFC Bank, but others as well.  According to data on interest rates compiled by Paisabazaar, Axis Bank and Karur Vysya Bank have also increased their effective new home loan rates by 5 bps this year. In January, the lowest home loan rates at Axis Bank and Karur Vysya Bank for a Rs 50 lakh loan were 8.70 percent and 8.95 percent, respectively. From March, these rates went up to 8.75 percent at Axis Bank and 9 percent at Karur Vysya Bank.  Nationalised lenders such as State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, and Bank of India, however, have not increased their rates.  Also read | Banks are increasing MCLR rates: Should you switch to repo-linked home loans and save on EMIs?  Change in spread to blame?  Home loan experts told Moneycontrol the hike in interest rates at HDFC Bank could be due to the change in spreads.  A repo rate-linked lending rate is made up of three components: the repo rate, the operating cost spread and the credit risk premium. Of these, once the home loan contract is signed, the operating cost spread can be reset only once in three years. However, the spread can be revised for new borrowers.  “This spread includes mainly the cost of funds, cost of overheads, margin for revenue generation/business (profitability),” Patel explained. He added that these may vary from bank to bank and are generally decided by the asset liability committee.  Who gets impacted?  Moneycontrol reported on March 28 that HDFC Bank’s new repo-linked interest rate is applicable to new home loans. So, transferring an existing loan from another bank to HDFC Bank or applying for a new home loan now will attract higher rates, as per the existing spread.  “The spread added by the bank on a repo rate in a home loan interest rate usually remains fixed for the term of the loan or until specified otherwise in your loan agreement,” said Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.com. As per the RBI’s external benchmark guidelines, banks can alter the operational cost spread over the repo rate (or any other external benchmark selected by the bank) only once in three years.  So, the widening of the spread will not affect the home loans of existing borrowers unless their credit scores have fallen significantly.  Also read | When taking home loan, make sure your down payment is high enough  What’s the impact on a new home loan borrower?    Let’s assume borrower A had taken a home loan of Rs 50 lakh for 25 years (300 months) from HDFC Bank in January, when the rate was 8.35 percent. The overall interest payable would be Rs 69.27 lakh (refer to graphic).  But when a new home loan borrower – B - applies for a Rs 50 lakh home loan with the same tenure now, the bank will offer the loan at a higher rate of 8.75 percent. The overall interest payable will be Rs 73.32 lakh during the tenure of 25 years.  Opting for a longer tenure - 29 years - to avoid paying higher EMIs will take the total interest payable to Rs 86.21 lakh (see table).    What new home loan borrowers should do  “New home loan borrowers should scout for banks offering loans with the narrowest possible spread,” said Shetty. This will reduce the interest payable.  Once the loan repayments start, always look to make part-prepayments with surplus funds. Also, annual bonuses or regular savings surplus can be used to prepay the loan faster and reduce the interest outgo if you have a home loan with HDFC Bank at these rates.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/hdfc-bank-raises-new-home-loan-rates-even-as-repo-rate-stays-steady-heres-why-12540371.html

Meanwhile SBI and HDFC will likely go live on the TPAP platform this week for Paytm’s consumer UPI business,"Mobile payments firm One97 Communications Ltd, which runs Paytm, is likely to sign private sector lender HDFC Bank as the third partner for migrating merchants on the Paytm platform, according to a couple of sources familiar with the matter.  These merchants were onboarded on the Paytm app as UPI merchants by the embattled Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL), which was asked by the Reserve Bank of India to stop all banking services from March 15.  Axis Bank and Yes Bank have already gone live on the Paytm platform. There are an estimated 3 crore merchants on the OCL platform. Paytm is also in discussions with Canara Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, with the former likely to go live next week.  Paytm, HDFC Bank, Canara Bank, and Kotak Mahindra Bank did not respond to Moneycontrol queries on the merchant acquisition business.  Meanwhile, HDFC Bank and SBI are likely to go live this week as payment service provider (PSP) banks for Paytm’s third party application provider (TPAP) business to run the UPI consumer business. Paytm has an estimated 9 crore UPI users on its platform.  Yes Bank and Axis Bank went live on the Paytm UPI platform on March 15, the day RBI's deadline for PPBL to stop all banking operations ran out. On the official website of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which runs UPI, SBI and HDFC are listed as works in progress.  Yes Bank had gone live with a closed user group of users with @ptyes handle while Axis Bank has gone with @ptaxis handle. SBI will go with @ptsbi and HDFC will go with @pthdfc handles.  Yes Bank has the additional role of migrating existing @paytm handles as of now. Paytm has around 90 million UPI users who are using @paytm handles. Other banks will also join Yes Bank in taking over these handles gradually. According to a banking source close to the development, Yes Bank has taken ownership of the maintenance of PPBL’s PSP banking services.  Hassle free migration  Paytm has around 11 percent market share in UPI and processes more than 3 billion beneficiary transactions and around 1.6 billion outgoing transactions. A seamless migration from PPBL to other banks is required for the world's largest real-time payment system UPI to function without any hassles.  The RBI, which imposed punitive restrictions on PPBL, has allowed OCL merchants and UPI users to continue using their handles, QR codes, and point-of-sale (PoS) machines even after March 15, when the restrictions come into force. This move by the regulator is to avoid any disruption to merchant and consumer payments.  Moneycontrol reported that while NPCI wants multiple banks to migrate the merchant accounts to avoid concentration risks, the commercial discussions between Paytm and banks will decide which partnerships will come through. The fact that banks also need to do the KYC of most of the merchants is an additional expense delaying the discussions.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/paytm-likely-to-onboard-hdfc-bank-as-the-third-merchant-acquiring-partner-this-week-12528671.html

So it would come as a surprise to most people that the top two consistent performers in the Nifty over the last one year have been Bajaj Auto and Hero Motocorp.  Similarly, few would have been willing to bet their money on Adani Ports after the pounding it look in January and February last year over the Hindenburg report. Here too the street is in for a surprise: Adani Ports figures at number three for consistency.  Follow our market blog for live updates  To test the consistency of performance of Nifty 50 stocks in FY24 we observed the monthly returns of Nifty 50 constituents and compared it with Nifty 50 returns.    Nifty 50 has delivered positive returns in 8 of the 12 months since April 2024 and only on 4 instances it has generated negative returns. However there are at least 16 Nifty stocks that gave positive returns on more occasions, reflecting better consistency in performance in FY24. And Adani Ports, Hero MotoCorp, and Bajaj Auto have given the maximum positive returns among the 16 contesters. Better consistency also indicates momentum in the underlying security.  Bajaj Auto gave positive returns in 11 months of the past 12 months and outperformed the index in 10 out of 12 months.  The company’s newly launched Triumph has presence in Bangalore and Kerala and its market share has reached 20 percent in the category. It plans to grow its footprint beyond 100 cities, covering 50 percent of the market “We expect Bajaj Auto to benefit from market share gains over the long term, driven by the premiumization trend, an opportunity in exports, and a sizeable position in the scooter EV market,” said Amber Shukla and Ankit Desai of Motilal Oswal.  As of March 20, Bajaj Auto has 21 buy calls, 12 hold calls, and 12 sell calls. The other consistent Nifty 50 outperformer has been Hero MotoCorp. The shares of company have outperformed Nifty 50 in 10 out of 12 months indicating consistency.  On the back of the resilient Indian economy, Hero MotoCorp’s  management expects to grow in double digits with new premium product launches, ramp-up of the EV product portfolio, introducing new Premia stores, Vida Hubs and upgrading existing stores to Hero 2.0, said Axis Securities in a report. The brokerage firm further said that reduced inventory levels and higher enquiries from rural geographies with higher demand for 125+ cc vehicles gives management the confidence to beat average industry growth in FY25.  As of March 20, Hero MotoCorp has 26 buy calls, eight hold calls, and 10 sell calls.  Adani Ports has given positive returns in 8 of the 12 months and outperformed the Nifty 50 in 8 of the 12 months. Adani Ports has one buy call, and zero hold and sell calls.  The lagging ones  HDFC Bank, JSW Steel and United Phosphorous underperformed Nifty 50 in the past 12 months on regular basis. All these three stocks gave positive returns in only 5 out of 12 months while United Phosphorous managed to outperform Nifty 50 only in 2 months while delivering lesser returns than Nifty in 10 out of 12 months, reflecting lack of momentum and buying.  As of March 20, HDFC Bank had 45 buy calls, five hold calls, and zero sell calls. JSW Steel had 12 buy calls, nine hold calls, and eight sell calls. United Phosphorous had 17 buy calls, eight hold calls, and seven sell calls.

Besides being more liquid, large caps also appear attractively valued compared to the second-line stocks that have suddenly fallen out of favour ","When the market was on an upswing, mid-cap and small-cap indices had outpaced the Sensex and Nifty by a mile. A similar trend is playing out on the way down as well. So far this week, the mid and small-cap indices have fallen by as much as 9 percent, compared to a 2 percent decline in the bigger indices.  Analysts expect this divergence to continue as they see panic-stricken investors flocking to the safety of large-caps. Besides being more liquid, large-caps also appear attractively valued compared to the second-line stocks that have suddenly fallen out of favour.  Top large-cap stocks experts are betting on  Deven Mehata, Equity Research Analyst, Choice Broking  Maruti Buy: Rs 11,400 | Stop Loss: Rs 11,000 | Target: Rs 12,300  The stock is trading very close to its all-time high of 11,730 at 11,400 levels. The critical support level at 11,000, closely aligned with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signifies historical buying interest and provides a foundation for the stock's price stability. Crucially, Maruti is trading above all significant moving averages, emphasising its underlying strength and positive sentiment.  On the higher side, once the stock surpasses 11,730 resistance, it can move towards 12,300 levels and higher. Meanwhile, 11,000 serves as a potential stop for downward movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.96, indicating a supportive environment for price gains. It's not yet in overbought territory, suggesting room for further growth.  L&amp;amp;T Buy: Rs 3,550 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,400 | Target: Rs 3,730 - 3,900  The stock has found substantial support around 3,400 levels. The recent robust bounce from this support suggests a bullish stance for LT. The potential for further upward movement, potentially reaching new all-time highs, is underlined by the stock's resilience at key support levels.  A breakthrough above the resistance at 3,635 could catalyze a strong upward movement, approaching the all-time high levels of 3,730 and beyond. This analysis suggests a favorable outlook for LT, supported by technical indicators pointing towards potential bullish momentum in the upcoming sessions.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One  TCS Buy: Rs 4,200 - 4,100 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,940 | Target: Rs 4,750  The IT giant has experienced an impressive rally in recent months, breaking out of a prolonged consolidation phase. While the broader market has been under pressure in the last few sessions, this particular stock has shown remarkable resilience and is now trading in uncharted levels. Looking at the weekly chart, we can see that prices have surged past a significant consolidation breakout pattern known as the 'saucer' formation.  Following this breakout, any minor pullbacks or consolidation phases have been met with buying interest. Despite indicators signaling overbought conditions, they also reflect the stock's underlying strength. Traders are advised to consider purchasing this stock at its current market price or on any subsequent dips.  HDFC Bank Buy: Rs 1,445 - 1,420 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,360 | Target: Rs 1,600  This prominent banking heavyweight has been a key contributor to the recent underperformance of the Bank Nifty. However, amid the recent market turmoil, this stock has shown resilience, displaying a relatively muted reaction and appears to be establishing a support base at attractive levels. This consolidation phase aligns with the long-term support of the 200-weekly moving average and is accompanied by robust trading volumes.  There's notable positive divergence evident, wherein although prices have reached new lows, oscillators have not, suggesting substantial accumulation of this stock at lower levels. Additionally, the recent closure of prices above the 20-day exponential moving average (20EMA) on the daily chart indicates a shift towards positive momentum in the short term. Given these factors and the favorable reward-to-risk ratio, we maintain a strong bullish outlook on this stock.

HDFC,2024-03-04T06:46:20+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Experts line up top 10 trading ideas for March series as Nifty scales historic high,"Experts expect the momentum to sustain in the coming weeks, too, with immediate resistance at 22,500-22,600, followed by the medium-term target of 23,000, provided it holds the upward sloping resistance trendline","Bulls retained their reign on Dalal Street for the third week in a row, continuing with a higher-high formation, and charging the benchmark Nifty 50 to a historic high of 22,420. The index found support in the 10-week exponential moving average to end with 0.75 percent gains at a new closing high of 22,378 for the week ended March 2.  Experts expect the momentum to sustain in the coming weeks, too, with immediate resistance at 22,500-22,600, followed by the medium-term target of 23,000, provided it holds the upward sloping resistance trendline (adjoining previous record high levels), while the support is placed at 22,200 and 22,000 levels.  Intermittent correction can't be ruled out, experts warned, given the divergence in the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) as the price makes higher highs and indicator makes lower highs.  &quot;Any moderate market dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity. A close below the 22,000 level in the upcoming week could signal weakening bullish sentiment, potentially prompting a retest of the 21,800 support level,&quot; Jigar S Patel, senior manager for equity research at Anand Rathi, said.  He said the levels to watch out for in the current week would be 22,500 - 22,600 on the higher side, and 22,000 - 21,800 on the lower side. Therefore, he advised traders to monitor the key support and resistance levels closely and remain flexible in their trading strategies.  Rohit Srivastava, founder of Strike Money Analytics and Indiacharts, feels the optimism comes from the new all-time high in the Nifty. &quot;The trendline of the highs gives us a resistance near 22,360 above which the Nifty needs to be able to sustain for a few days before we can qualify it as a sustainable breakout and not a false breakout,&quot; he said.  Other than that multiple divergences in indicators like the RSI (relative strength index) make it look like a topping process in the market, he feels.  Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock ideas from experts with 2-4 weeks perspective. The closing price of March 2 is considered for the stock return calculation.

The medium-term weekly chart pattern is signaling a possible upside breakout of broader range movement. This is positive indication. The volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price in last week and the daily RSI shows positive indication. The overall chart pattern of PEL indicates long trading opportunity.  Buying can be initiated in PEL at CMP (Rs 935), add more on dips down to Rs 900, wait for the upside target of Rs 1,035 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 875.

With the long-term charts being positive and the price being near anchor VWAP support zones, it is expected that the stock should gradually move above Rs 1,480 and head towards Rs 1,520 mark in the next 3-4 weeks.    Apollo Hospitals Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,133 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,925 | Target: Rs 6,300 and Rs 6,500 | Return: 6 percent  On daily charts, the stock has been moving in an uptrend and successfully touched its trendline in Friday's session. It saw a long wick rejection below the trendline, indicating good buying at lower levels in the stock.  Going forward, Rs 5,940 is going to be a major support for Apollo Hospitals, so a strict stop-loss at Rs 5,925 should be kept for potential upside targets of Rs 6,300 and Rs 6,500 in the next 2-3 weeks.  Expert: Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi  Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,724 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,665 | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 5.6 percent  Following a peak close to Rs 1,926 level, Kotak Mahindra Bank underwent a substantial decline of around 10 percent in its value. However, in the past month, the bank has established a prolonged bottom around the 1.13 harmonic ratio. Interestingly, a bullish AB=CD pattern has also emerged near the aforementioned ratio, providing further bullish confirmation.  Additionally, on the indicator front, there is a bullish divergence observed on the daily stochastic (please refer to the chart), indicating a positive outlook for the stock. Consequently, one may consider buying in the range of Rs 1,705-1,730 with an upside target of Rs 1,820 and a stop-loss set at Rs 1,665.

On January 31, the RBI announced major business restrictions on PPBL  citing supervisory concerns arising from prolonged non-compliance with  know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) norms. The decision evoked a mixed response from the fintech community and caused a major drop  in Paytm’s share price.  What do the numbers say?  Of the three banks which have seen a notable rise in the downloads of their payments apps, state-run Bank of Baroda's (BOB) World UPI app has seen a 44.3% increase in daily downloads over the last 26 days, the Appfigures data showed. As per the firm, the daily downloads of BOB World UPI on Feb 1 was 4,515, but rose to 6,513 on Feb 27.  Similarly, State Bank of India (SBI) saw a  9.5% increase  in downloads during the same period. On Feb 1, the daily downloads of YONO SBI was 61,943, which grew  to 67,804 on Feb 27, per the data.  Likewise, ICICI bank's iMobile Pay app   grew 15.8%,  from daily downloads of 10,040  on Feb 1, to 11,623 on Feb 27.   Bank payment apps download trend since Paytm crisis  HDFC Bank’s downloads fall  HDFC bank's PayZapp app saw a 46.7% drop in downloads during this period. PayZapp’s daily downloads from Google Play store on February 1 were 65,829, which declined to 35,056 on February 27. However,  the downloads shot up to 72,512 on Feb 5, per the data.  Emails sent to HDFC Bank, BoB, ICICI Bank, and SBI seeking their comments for this story remained unanswered till the time of filing the copy.  What do experts say?  “HDFC PayZapp's focus is on a premium, affluent user base, potentially reflecting its parent bank's positioning, which may not resonate with non-urban users,” said Monica Jasuja, a fintech  industry insider.  “Concerns surrounding Paytm's future, fuelled by rumours about its payments bank, could be pushing these users to seek alternative apps, which explains why PSU banks’ payment apps have shown significant growth in the last few days,” added d Jasuja.  The Paytm saga  On January 31, the RBI barred PPBL from accepting fresh deposits and undertaking credit transactions after February 29. The central bank later extended the deadline to March 15.  The Appfigures data shows that Paytm has seen a 44% decline in daily downloads, from 1,28,666 on February 1,  to 72,117 on Feb 27.  The RBI has said that Paytm merchants have to get a new QR code linked with a bank account other than PPBL in order to use Paytm’s soundbox and POS terminal services after March 15.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/big-banks-payment-apps-see-jump-in-daily-downloads-since-paytm-crisis-hdfc-banks-numbers-fall-12383171.html

The bank’s deposit growth will not match loan growth overnight but will rather follow a glide path, he said. &quot;We realise that we have preponed our loan growth and so we need a transition time to warm up the engine and raise a sustainable funding which will substitute some of the bond maturity,&quot; said Jagdishan. He further said that this will help the bank match its share of loans and deposits.

However, going ahead, the bank aims to maintain a healthy incremental LDR by balancing loan deployment and payments.

However, he acknowledged that Paytm has a robust technology platform, which HDFC Bank is leveraging through a partnership. Jagdishan was speaking at an investor conference hosted by Goldman Sachs on February 19.  Last month, the banking regulator barred Paytm Payments Bank from accepting fresh deposits, and topping up Paytm wallet from February 29. The central bank then extended the deadline to March 15. Paytm also partnered with Axis Bank and shifted their nodal account to the bank to ensure merchants can continue using Paytm’s QR codes and sound boxes.

When asked about whether HDFC Bank and Paytm partnership opens up more opportunities, Jagdishan said, “We are far more sanguine on what we want to acquire, even on the merchant side.” India’s largest private sector bank would continue to do such experiments as long as they are in compliance with the regulatory norms, he added.  Jagshisan termed the Paytm app as “very well respected” and popular. “We have a PayZapp which probably can get a slightly better run rate, and that’s what we hope to have on merchant acquiring.”  At the same time, HDFC Bank does not want to target everything and is not in a hurry to acquire all the opportunities available. “The company will pick up opportunities that are available and will expand there organically,” Jagdishan said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/what-happened-to-paytm-unfortunate-hdfc-bank-harnessing-its-tech-with-tie-ups-says-sashi-jagdishan-12306221.html
HDFC,2024-02-18T16:36:26+05:30,Jigar Patel,"Bullish momentum likely to continue, pick these 3 stocks for return up to 40% in short term","One can add longs in HDFC Bank in the zone of Rs 1,400-1,425 for upside target of Rs 1,500 and stop-loss would be placed near Rs 1,368 on daily close basis.","The past week in the market was characterised by a clear dominance of bullish sentiment, with little opposition from bearish forces. This upward movement resulted in a notable gain of 1.19 percent for the week ending February 16, reflecting the strength of the bullish trend.  In previous weekly analysis, we noted the rising trend in the India VIX, which is a measure of market volatility, suggesting potential uncertainties ahead. However, despite this initial indication, the VIX formed a triple top pattern during the past week, reaching a peak of 16.57 before closing near the 15 mark. This pattern formation, coupled with the decline in the VIX by the end of the week, suggests a potential shift in sentiment towards stability or even optimism. The VIX's weekly loss of -1.46 percent further reinforces this interpretation, indicating a decrease in market volatility compared to the previous week.  In analyzing the Nifty index, despite the weekly closing falling short of the all-time high of approximately 22,126.80, there are several indicators pointing towards continued bullish momentum. One such indicator is the weekly stochastic, which has shown a bullish crossover after reversing from the 60 levels. This suggests that the buying pressure is strengthening, potentially leading to further upward movement in the market during the upcoming week. Additionally, the long/short ratio, currently fluctuating between 36-40, holds significance in determining market sentiment. A steady increase in this ratio by the next week could provide additional support for the bulls, fueling further upside movement in the Nifty index.  However, it's crucial to consider the possibility of a reversal or correction in the market. If the Nifty index were to close below the 21,800 level in the upcoming week, it may indicate a weakening of bullish sentiment and could prompt a retest of the 21,500 support level.  Bank Nifty  The banking index demonstrated resilience and strength in the past week as it rebounded once again from its 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA). This rebound was significant, leading to a weekly gain of 1.64 percent, indicating a renewed interest in buying from lower levels.  Moreover, in the previous week's analysis, a bullish BAT pattern on a daily scale was identified, hinting at the potential for upward momentum. As anticipated, the Bank Nifty indeed experienced a significant surge, pumping 1,800 points from its low to high. This reaffirms the validity and effectiveness of technical analysis in identifying potential market movements.  Looking ahead, it's crucial to monitor the Bank Nifty's performance closely. The index needs to maintain the support level of 46,000 in the upcoming week to sustain its bullish momentum. If it successfully holds above this level, there's a possibility of it testing the 47,500 level, indicating further upward movement.  However, failure to maintain support at 46,000 could result in additional selling pressure, potentially pushing the Bank Nifty down towards the next support level at 45,500.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,420 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,368 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 5.6 percent  HDFC Bank peaked at around Rs 1,721 on December 28, 2023, before declining by approximately Rs 358 (21 percent). Over the past two weeks, the stock has traded within a tight range of Rs 1,380 to Rs 1,480, indicating market indecision.  On indicator front, the daily scale stochastics indicator identified a &quot;Regular Bull Divergence&quot; near a 1.13 harmonic ratio (refer to the chart). This divergence suggests potential upward momentum despite recent price declines, signalling a possible bullish reversal in the near future. Thus one can add longs in the zone of Rs 1,400-1,425 for upside target of Rs 1,500 and stop-loss would be placed near Rs 1,368 on daily close basis.    MMTC: Buy | LTP: Rs 78.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 58 | Target: Rs 110 | Return: 40 percent  Recently, MMTC has exhibited a significant technical development, notably forming an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the monthly scale, particularly within the price range of Rs 65-75 levels. This pattern, characterised by three troughs with the middle one (head) lower than the others (shoulders), often signifies a bullish reversal.  Adding to the bullish sentiment is the observation on the indicator front. The Monthly Stochastic Oscillator, a momentum indicator, has reversed direction from the 50 level. Such a reversal is typically interpreted as a shift in momentum from bearish to bullish.  Combining these technical signals, we've recommended traders to initiate long positions in MMTC within the range of Rs 70-80, with a bullish target set at Rs 110. To manage risk, we've suggested implementing a stop-loss strategy, with the stop-loss set at Rs 58 on a daily closing basis.    Rain Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 201 | Stop-Loss: Rs 175 | Target: Rs 240 | Return: 19 percent  From March 2023 till December 2023, the said counter has been consolidating between Rs 145 and Rs 155. Since last 2 months, it has given a breakout from the said range on a weekly closing basis, which is looking lucrative.  Having said that, it has also formed a bullish GARTLEY pattern, which is 1.38 years old, thus making it more reliable. Also, it has violated a couple of trendlines (refer to the chart). The best part about this bullish reversal is that every bottom has bought with huge volume bars (refer to the chart), which indicates bullish bias in the counter.  On the indicator front, the monthly stochastic shying away from being oversold, which further affirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, we advised traders and investors to go long in the range of Rs 190-205 with an upside target of Rs 240, and the stop-loss would be placed at Rs 175 on a daily close basis.  Note: The Gartley pattern is a harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, that helps traders identify reaction highs and lows.

The merger  Termed as the biggest transaction in India’s corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4, 2022 agreed to take over the biggest housing finance company in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.

HDFC,2024-02-14T13:18:17+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"Midday Mood | Markets at day's high, Nifty above 21,600; ICICI Bank, SBI help in rebound","Nifty will undergo volatility throughout the trading session, primarily oscillating within the 21,650 to 21,750 range, experts said","The Sensex and Nifty recovered from their opening lows and hovered near the day's high, albeit in the red, during the afternoon trade on February 13. Heavyweights ICICI Bank and State Bank of India aided the up move.  At 1 pm, the Sensex was down 230.49 points or 0.32 percent at 71,324.70, and the Nifty was down 56.00 points or 0.26 percent at 21,687.30.  Markets are subdued as hotter-than-expected US inflation print has spilled water on Street's expectations of a rate cut in March 2024. Though some relief came after India's wholesale inflation eased to 0.27 percent in January. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation was at 0.73 percent in December 2023 and 4.80 percent in January 2023.  Going ahead, volatility will continue, believe analysts, as India VIX continue to trade near its highest level in a year.  Follow our live blog for all market action  About 1,874 shares advanced, 1,317 shares declined, and 74 traded unchanged. The top stocks pulling the Nifty higher were ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, Reliance Industries and ITC while Infosys, HDFC Bank and TCS pulled it down.  Fundamental view  The Fed had indicated possibly three rate cuts in 2024 and markets had discounted up to five on expectations that inflation in the US will continue to cool off, noted Dr VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.  Also Read: IT, pharma stocks slide as rate cut prospects diminish  &quot;This expectation has received a jolt from the US CPI inflation numbers rising year-on-year to 3.1 percent against expectation of 2.9 percent. This means that the Fed will certainly not cut rates in March and the number of rate cuts in 2024 also will be lower,&quot; he said.  As US treasury yields go up, it also means the foreign investors' appetite for risky asset class like emerging markets equities goes down. So the expectation of foreign institutional investors coming back with a bang, also takes a backseat.  Technical view  The Nifty's call options exhibited the highest open interest (OI) at 21,900, closely trailed by the 22,000 strike prices, said Shrey Jain, founder and CEO SAS Online.  The maximum OI for put options is at the 21,500 strike price.  &quot;Based on this analysis, it is expected that the Nifty will undergo volatility throughout the trading session, primarily oscillating within the 21,650 to 21,750 range,&quot; he said.

HDFC,2024-02-09T08:58:08+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Chris Wood bats for Indian PSUs citing Modi government focus on 'value creation',"The Indian government has signaled value creation in PSUs with regard to disinvestment, and thus, investors must pay attention to the cheaper part of the market, said Chris Wood of Jefferies.","Famed equity strategist Chris Wood said investors must pay more attention to the stocks of Indian PSUs, citing Prime Minister Narendra Modi-government's focus on value creation. These public sector company stocks are the 'cheaper part of the Indian market', and the government focus remains on privatisation, said Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies.  &quot;The other point about the budget is that the government, as regards the disinvestment or privatisation agenda, signalled that the focus will be on value creation in public sector companies. In our view, this is a reason for investors to pay more attention to a cheaper part of the Indian market, namely state-owned enterprises,&quot; said Wood in his latest 'GREED &amp;amp; Fear' note.  The Nifty PSE index has rallied 110 percent in the last one year. State Bank of India has gained 31 percent in the last one year, while Life Corporation of India has gained 74 percent. Hindustan Aeronautics has surged 147 percent in the same period.  Earlier this week, PM Modi  lauded the increased public confidence in public sector units (PSUs) under the BJP-led NDA government. In an address to the Rajya Sabha, Modi noted that the net worth of India's PSU companies has surged by 78 percent since 2014, and their shares are now yielding favourable returns.  Before that, last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also highlighted that the government was all in to improve the valuation of PSUs, in an exclusive interview with Network18. Government-owned companies have historically traded at discounts to their private peers. However, in the last couple of years, they have closed the gap.  Portfolio changes  Wood has announced adjustments to the India long-only portfolio, ahead of upcoming general elections. In the India long-only portfolio, a new investment in Bharti Airtel will be introduced, accounting for 3 percent weight.  This addition will come by reducing the investment in Reliance Industries by three percentage points. The allocation to HDFC Bank will be reduced by two percentage points.  Investments in Axis Bank and State Bank of India will each be increased by a percentage point.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  As for the global long-only portfolio, Wood reduced investment in HDFC Bank by two percentage points, while that in Axis Bank and TSMC were increased by a percentage point each.    Wood wrote in his note that the interim budget was a pleasant surprise to GREED &amp;amp; Fear, his much followed column. &quot;It is testament to the confidence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the pending general election in April-May that his government announced a budget on 1 February that is almost devoid of vote-buying populism,&quot; he wrote.  With government capex set to increase 17 percent year-on-year to Rs 11.11 lakh crore in FY25, Wood reiterates L&amp;amp;T GREED &amp;amp; Fear's 6 percent weighting in that stock in the India long-only portfolio and a 5 percent position in the Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio.  &quot;It has been an ongoing feature of Modi’s government that the fiscal deficits have been used mainly to finance infrastructure investments rather than transfer payments,&quot; he said.

HDFC,2024-02-08T07:35:39+05:30,Santosh Nair,"Next HDFC Bank will be discovered by HNIs, not FIIs; SME platform the IPL of investing: Gunavanth Vaid",Vaid has been a believer in the small and micro cap story since 2013 when he first started looking at this space seriously,"Chennai-based independent investor Gunavanth Vaid is seen as one of the most vocal champions of small and micro cap stocks. He calls himself an accidental chartered accountant-turned-accidental investor, and is an unabashed supporter of the India growth story.  Critics among his peers call him overconfident and lacking in sense of proportion, but grudgingly accept that his investing style has paid off.  An avid movie and cricket buff, Vaid has been a believer in the small and micro cap story since 2013 when he first started looking at this space seriously. His early bets that went on to become multibaggers include Caplin Point Lab (up 53x over the last 10 years), Fredun Pharmaceuticals (up 65x) and Kingfa Science (up 60x). More recently he was among the early investors in Gensol which has risen 50x in a little over two years.  In his first ever media interaction, Vaid spoke to Moneycontrol about his journey, investing style, the growing dominance of ultra HNIs and why he is a one-way bull on the small cap narrative.  Excerpts from the interview:  How did you get into investing?  I am a practicing chartered accountant, having got my degree in 1997. In 2013, I suddenly landed up with a huge liability because of a verbal commitment to a close friend. I did not have the funds to pay him but had a good understanding of financial statements. I told the friend to buy a stock, and luckily for me, the price more than doubled in the next couple of months. Looking at the astounding return, I thought I could make a living by identifying such companies.  Which was your first big bet?  Caplin Point. One of the companies I used to audit was owned by a close friend of mine. This firm was a trader in excipients (varying used as lubricant, flavouring agent, binder in pharmaceutical formulation) and used to supply to various pharma companies. Caplin suddenly stepped up its purchases of excipients and I found out that the decision did not have to do with simply changing vendors. It was a sign that the company had bagged a major order. Back then, the market had a poor perception of Caplin because of past issues.  One of my philosophies about money was that ‘paisa wahin jahan koi nahin’ (the money is where no one wants to go). And the Caplin promoters seemed to have a similar approach, considering that they were selling in a tough market like Guatemala. So I decided to buy the stock.  How did your investment in Kingfa come about?  One of the juniors in my audit firm told me that a client was having issues with advance tax payment. I learnt it had received a big order from a sick company recently taken over by a new promoter. I got curious and looked up the acquirer. It was China-based Kingfa, which had a 1.4 million tonne capacity back home for the same product that it had bought a 12,000 tonne capacity in India. I had a hunch that this was just the beginning, and was proved right. Kingfa has scaled up its capacity in a big way over the years.  In the case of Fredun Pharma, it was delaying payment to suppliers. When I spoke to a senior executive there, I learnt that the delay was due to the company having ploughed every available rupee into a big capex plan. I realised that it was a temporary cash flow problem, and liked the promoter’s passion for their business.  Any incident in the initial years of investing you recall that helped you gain confidence to take bigger bets?  When Kingfa did an offer-for-sale (OFS), some of my friends were keen to invest. But on the day of the OFS, the market tanked, and only two of my friends said they would still go ahead. Having committed to the promoter to buy a certain quantity, I borrowed money to buy a bigger block than I had planned to. That turned out to be hugely profitable. My grandfather always used to say: koi maangta hai to de dena chahiye aur koi deta hai to le lena chaahiye (If someone asks, give and if someone gives, take) That approach has worked well for me.  Some of your peers say you have spread yourself too thin by investing in too many companies...  Till Covid, I was taking concentrated bets. There was a time Kingfa accounted for nearly 99 percent of my portfolio. Things changed after Covid. What Indian Premier League did to cricket, the SME platform did to the stock market. Thanks to IPL, you can now have three different teams for different formats. Similarly, an entrepreneur does not have to come from a pedigreed business family to be able to succeed. If someone has a vision and the ambition, there are enough retail investors willing to back him.  HDFC Bank became HDFC Bank because of FIIs, but the next HDFC Bank will be made by retail investors. By retail I mean HNIs and ultra HNIs.  Take the case of a leading solar module maker recently. It struggled to raise money from institutions, but HNIs supported it. And today institutions are investing.  How many stocks do you own in your portfolio?  Around 100. And it will only increase.  Why?  To use a cricketing parlance, India has got a free hit for the next 5-7 years. And you are getting a full toss on the leg side.  Do you manage them through a fund?  No, I don’t run a fund.  Talk in the market is that India Opportunity Fund is managed by you...  No. At one point, there were a few common stocks. But there are a couple of other funds too which have copied some of my ideas. But as we speak, there are no common stocks in my portfolio and IOF’s.  All the stocks you buy are under your name as an individual?  A few of them are in my name, but most of them I buy in my family office name.  We had seen a similar exuberance in mid and small caps in 2018 and it ended badly. What is different this time?  That is like saying if a batsman has got out for 70 two times, he will get out for 70 the third time as well. Why can’t he score a triple century? For the first time you are seeing promoters sounding more confident than investors. Previously only the price to earning multiple would expand, not the earnings per share. This time, the EPS is expanding. How many times in the past have you seen small cap companies delivering a compounded earnings growth of 50-70 percent?  Free hit, leg side full toss. You make it sound as though almost can walk in there and make money.  Not really. If success had a predictable pattern, every Yash Raj movie or Karan Johar movie would have been a hit. Kohli and Tendulkar would hit a century every time. I am not saying anybody, and everybody can make money at will. Just that the conditions are more favourable this time if you know how to make the most of it.  Are you saying there is no exuberance in the market, particularly among retail investors?  Retail today is much more aware than before. If they are buying dubious stocks it is not because they don’t know about the company. They know but think they will be able to get out before the stock crashes. It does not happen that way. If they lose money in bad stocks, they will shrug it off because the chance of that happening was high. The problem is if investors lose money in a company they thought was good. Those investors may not return.  Many of the small and micro cap stocks are quoting at what seems like exorbitant valuations.  They may seem expensive right now. But with many of these companies, the jump in earnings is rapid. So you can’t wait for the valuation to become reasonable before buying them.  How long do you see this craze continuing?  Get used to this continuing for the next 5-7 years. I may sound arrogant, but since the last three years, and for the next 7 years, people who invest in stocks using conventional parameters will continue to underperform. This is the time to bet on the likes of a Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rajat Patidar and Rinku Singh for Rs 40 lakh and see them becoming worth Rs 10 crore, rather than betting on an Ajinkya Rahane or Cheteshwar Pujara for Rs 8 crore even if they are technically better batsmen.  Healthy order books are one thing, but the way the market is many stocks in the manufacturing sector seems to suggest that execution is not a problem at all.  So let us take the case of EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) or defence companies. None of them have created meaningful wealth for the last so many years, barring an L&amp;amp;T. But the work they are doing today is the same as what they were doing in the past. Earlier they would start work on a project, and soon they would run into problems, and usually to do with government approvals for land etc. Or they would not get payment from the government in time. As a result, the cost of the project would go up. That is not the case, approvals are faster, and payments are made on time….one should credit this government for that.  If there are 100 companies in your portfolio, how can you understand so many diverse industries?  I won’t claim to be an expert on understanding businesses. But I am good at understanding the person who runs the business. I believe all businesses are ordinary, it is the promoter who makes it extraordinary. So, the key is to identify the right promoter.  Does that not mean having to take the promoter at face value, and a higher risk because of the dependency on one person?  Agree. But that is the approach I like to take for my investments. There is a keyman risk no doubt, but then investment is about taking risks.  That’s quite an unconventional style of investing...  If one were to go by convention, only Yash Chopra and Karan Johar would be making movies. But look at what is happening today—you have Bahubali, RRR, Pushpa, KGF. These kinds of movies are the rage. Same way cricket. No coach would recommend a reverse sweep, or a Dilshan scoop. Ten years ago, a Surya Kumar Yadav would not have made it to the national cricket team. Today all successful batsmen have some shots that defy logic, but work. That is why teams can case down 400. When T20 was started, the milestones for a batsman were measured in 30s and 50s. Now it is 50s and 100s.  How many companies do you meet in a month?  Around 40, sometimes even 45.  How do you know if a promoter’s intention is genuine?  You develop that filter over time.  Do you recall instances where a promoter seemed honest but later turned out to be a fraud?  In my experience, rarely do promoters start honest and then become crooks. If it happens, I would say my assessment of him was wrong to begin with. I don’t believe in chor bane mor (thief becomes peacock). To me, once a thief, always a thief.  You don’t believe in giving a second chance if the business model is good...  One of my rules is never try to make money off a bad stock. You will win for a while but lose it all and more in the end. I don’t think a crook can reform. Maybe the next generation will be honest. But when I don’t have enough money to give good businessmen, why should I even think of betting on a dubious promoter who claims to have changed.  But promoters don’t always stick to the rule book...  Agree. But there is a difference between a promoter who wants to suppress profits for a year so that the money saved on tax can be ploughed back into the business to grow it, and a promoter who suppresses profits to fund his lavish lifestyle.  What are the themes that you are betting on?  I am still bullish on the China replacement theme. (Clients buying the same product from an Indian manufacturer if it is available). Besides, I am very bullish on the recycling theme. Biodiesel is one of them. In the UK the government has already made it mandatory for manufacturers to recycle a certain percentage of their products under the EPR (extended product responsibility) rule. That will soon be the case in India as well. Recycling is a specialised job, the upside for established players will be huge.  Anything that makes you cautious?  Structurally, India is in a sweet spot till 2030. In between, there will be ups and downs in the market. But that is how the market is. Just because something good is happening, does not mean it should always end badly. Yes, if the sun rises it will set. But have a good time till then. Besides, the sun will rise again tomorrow.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/next-hdfc-bank-will-be-discovered-by-hnis-not-fiis-sme-platform-the-ipl-of-investing-gunavanth-vaid-2-12217481.html

Kohli and Tendulkar would hit a century every time. I am not saying anybody, and everybody can make money at will. Just that the conditions are more favourable this time if you know how to make the most of it.  Are you saying there is no exuberance in the market, particularly among retail investors?  Retail today is much more aware than before. If they are buying dubious stocks it is not because they don’t know about the company. They know but think they will be able to get out before the stock crashes. It does not happen that way. If they lose money in bad stocks, they will shrug it off because the chance of that happening was high. The problem is if investors lose money in a company they thought was good. Those investors may not return.  Many of the small and micro cap stocks are quoting at what seems like exorbitant valuations.  They may seem expensive right now. But with many of these companies, the jump in earnings is rapid. So you can’t wait for the valuation to become reasonable before buying them.  How long do you see this craze continuing?  Get used to this continuing for the next 5-7 years. I may sound arrogant, but since the last three years, and for the next 7 years, people who invest in stocks using conventional parameters will continue to underperform. This is the time to bet on the likes of a Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rajat Patidar and Rinku Singh for Rs 40 lakh and see them becoming worth Rs 10 crore, rather than betting on an Ajinkya Rahane or Cheteshwar Pujara for Rs 8 crore even if they are technically better batsmen.  Healthy order books are one thing, but the way the market is many stocks in the manufacturing sector seems to suggest that execution is not a problem at all.  So let us take the case of EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) or defence companies. None of them have created meaningful wealth for the last so many years, barring an L&amp;amp;T. But the work they are doing today is the same as what they were doing in the past. Earlier they would start work on a project, and soon they would run into problems, and usually to do with government approvals for land etc. Or they would not get payment from the government in time. As a result, the cost of the project would go up. That is not the case, approvals are faster, and payments are made on time….one should credit this government for that.  If there are 100 companies in your portfolio, how can you understand so many diverse industries?  I won’t claim to be an expert on understanding businesses. But I am good at understanding the person who runs the business. I believe all businesses are ordinary, it is the promoter who makes it extraordinary. So, the key is to identify the right promoter.  Does that not mean having to take the promoter at face value, and a higher risk because of the dependency on one person?  Agree. But that is the approach I like to take for my investments. There is a keyman risk no doubt, but then investment is about taking risks.  That’s quite an unconventional style of investing  If one were to go by convention, only Yash Chopra and Karan Johar would be making movies. But look at what is happening today—you have Bahubali, RRR, Pushpa, KGF. These kinds of movies are the rage. Same way cricket. No coach would recommend a reverse sweep, or a Dilshan scoop. Ten years ago, a Surya Kumar Yadav would not have made it to the national cricket team. Today all successful batsmen have some shots that defy logic, but work. That is why teams can chase down 400. When T20 was started, the milestones for a batsman were measured in 30s and 50s. Now it is 50s and 100s.  How many companies do you meet in a month?  Around 40, sometimes even 45.  How do you know if a promoter’s intention is genuine?  You develop that filter over time.  Do you recall instances where a promoter seemed honest but later turned out to be a fraud?  In my experience, rarely do promoters start honest and then become crooks. If it happens, I would say my assessment of him was wrong to begin with. I don’t believe in chor bane mor (thief becomes peacock). To me, once a thief, always a thief.  You don’t believe in giving a second chance if the business model is good?  One of my rules is never try to make money off a bad stock. You will win for a while but lose it all and more in the end. I don’t think a crook can reform. Maybe the next generation will be honest. But when I don’t have enough money to give good businessmen, why should I even think of betting on a dubious promoter who claims to have changed?  But promoters don’t always stick to the rule book...  Agree. But there is a difference between a promoter who wants to suppress profits for a year so that the money saved on tax can be ploughed back into the business to grow it, and a promoter who suppresses profits to fund his lavish lifestyle.  What are the themes that you are betting on?  I am still bullish on the China replacement theme. (Clients buying the same product from an Indian manufacturer if it is available). Besides, I am very bullish on the recycling theme. Biodiesel is one of them. In the UK the government has already made it mandatory for manufacturers to recycle a certain percentage of their products under the EPR (extended product responsibility) rule. That will soon be the case in India as well. Recycling is a specialised job, the upside for established players will be huge.  Anything that makes you cautious?  Structurally, India is in a sweet spot till 2030. In between, there will be ups and downs in the market. But that is how the market is. Just because something good is happening, does not mean it should always end badly. Yes, if the sun rises it will set. But have a good time till then. Besides, the sun will rise again tomorrow.

The bank raised $300 million for a period of three years and $450 million for a five-year tenure.  The bond issue is a part of an overall raise of $750 million through Regulation S Bonds.  The proceeds of the sustainable finance bond would be used to fund green and social loans in accordance with the sustainable finance, while the rest of the proceeds will go towards financing general banking activities, the bank said in a statement.  “''The funds raised through the sustainable finance bonds will be prioritised for lending towards electric vehicles, SMEs and affordable housing,” Arup Rakshit, Group Head-Treasury, HDFC Bank, said.

HDFC,2024-02-06T14:06:46+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra,MC Explains | Will HDFC group go ahead and acquire 9.5% stake in all the 6 banks?,"While RBI's approval is sentimentally positive for the six stocks in the near term, it does not mean that HDFC's stake will necessarily go up to 9.5 percent in those six banks","HDFC Bank group on February 6 received the Reserve Bank of India's approval to hike its stake up to 9.5 percent in six banks, including Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank, over the next one year.  While this is sentimentally positive for the six stocks in the near term, it does not mean that HDFC's stake will necessarily go up to 9.5 percent in these lenders .  We spoke to analysts and looked into past trends of such RBI approvals. Here is what we found:  What is the RBI approval all about?  The HDFC group as a whole, including HDFC Life, HDFC AMC and HDFC Ergo, can now acquire up to 9.5 percent stake each in six banks - IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank and Bandhan Bank.  A business group cannot hold more than 10 percent stake in a bank. Therefore, approvals are sought for 9.99 percent, the maximum limit.  Despite the perceived intent, it does not mean that full 9.99 percent stake will be acquired. Since it does not make sense to seek RBI approval for every 1-2 percent stake, companies tend to ask for the maximum 9.99 percent.  How much does the HDFC group currently hold in these banks?  At the end of the December quarter, it held 3.43 percent in ICICI Bank, 2.57 percent in Axis Bank, 4.48 percent in IndusInd Bank and 3 percent in Yes Bank.  Why is RBI approval needed?  The RBI's approval is a must for anyone looking to acquire more than 5 percent stake in a bank as it is a highly regulated sector, said Vijay Singh Gour, lead analyst, Choice Broking.  Also Read: China's market restrictions won't help, may be bad for EMs, no immediate impact on India  What is the validity of the approval?  The approval is valid for a year and if HDFC fails to acquire the shareholding within that period, the approval stands cancelled.  If the holding stands at sub-5 percent before the year-end, then RBI’s approval will be required again to increase it to 5 percent or more.  Is this sign of merger?  No. It is simply an approval for investment purpose, clarified Jignesh Shial of Incred Equities.  Other examples...  LIC on January 24 received the RBI's approval to acquire up to 9.99 percent in HDFC Bank. In December 2023, ICICI Prudential AMC got RBI nod to acquire 9.99 percent in Federal Bank.  In October 2023, HDFC AMC got the RBI’s go-ahead to acquire 9.5 percent in DCB Bank, Equitas Small Finance Bank, The Federal Bank, Karur Vysya Bank and City Union Bank.  Also Read: Credit growth to moderate to 13%; Paytm and lower-rated NBFCs at risk: Macquarie’s Suresh Ganapathy  Any instances where RBI approval has lapsed before a 9.9 percent stake acquisition?  Yes. In November 2021, LIC got approval to hike stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank to up to 9.9 percent. A year later, its stake in the lender had gone up to 6.25 percent from 4.96 percent.  In May 2023, SBI MF received similar approval for HDFC Bank. Three months to go for the validity to lapse and SBI MF holds about 5.57 percent stake in the bank.  What does it mean for the six stocks?  It is a sentimentally positive news, said Nitin Aggarwal, head–BFSI research, institutional equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “Flows should come in over the medium term,&quot; he said.  What do back-to-back RBI approvals indicate?  Domestic institutions, including LIC, are eyeing to increase stake in private banks. Since October 2023, domestic institutions have created over Rs 1.4 lakh crore headroom to buy stakes.  With the general election unlikely to throw a surprise and expectations of private capex picking up, domestic institutions are waiting on the sidelines to hike stakes in banks and financials.  Banking stocks are seen as a reasonably valued bets at a time when the market sits on high valuations, analysts said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/mc-explains-will-hdfc-group-go-ahead-and-acquire-9-5-stake-in-all-the-6-banks-12203291.html
HDFC,2024-02-06T12:12:35+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra,Rush for financials: Domestic institutions sit on Rs 1.41-trillion headroom to buy bank stakes,"The most recent approval came on February 6 when HDFC group received the RBI nod to acquire up to 9.5 percent in six banks - IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank and Bandhan Bank","Amid raging speculation over the return of the BJP-led government for the third straight term and expectation of a pick-up in private capex, domestic institutions are waiting on the sidelines to raise their stakes in banks and financials. Banking stocks are seen as reasonably valued bets at a time when the market simmers on high valuations, said analysts.  HDFC, ICICI, SBI as well as LIC are among the domestic institutions to have sought approval from the Reserve Bank of India for raising their stakes in banks up to 9.9 percent. This creates an additional headroom for purchases worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore over the next one year, with regulatory approvals in place.  For the uninitiated, the RBI's prior approval is a must for anyone looking to acquire more than 5 percent stake in a bank as it is a highly regulated sector.    The rush to get approvals for higher stakes started in October 2023 on expectations that the Fed’s pivot to lower rates will prompt foreign investors to come back to Indian markets in a big way.  Also read: HDFC Bank Group gets RBI nod to acquire up to 9.5% stakes in Yes Bank, IndusInd &amp;amp; 4 others  The most recent approval came on February 6 when HDFC group received the RBI nod to acquire up to 9.5 percent in six banks - IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank and Bandhan Bank.  LIC had earlier received the RBI go-ahead to buy 9.99 percent stake in HDFC Bank.  Banking sector outlook  Analysts as well as fund managers are bullish on financials, especially private sector banks, as they continue to gain market share while maintaining healthy asset quality.  Rating agency ICRA recently raised its projection of bank credit growth for FY24 to 14.9-15.3 percent from its earlier estimate of 12.8-13 percent.  For FY25, credit growth may temper to 11.7-12.6 percent, but it will still remain sizeable, ICRA said.  Also read: Moneycontrol Poll | Bankers, economists expect MPC to leave repo rate unchanged on Thursday  ICRA also expects the gross NPA (non performing assets) to decline to 2.1-2.5 percent and net-NPA to 0.5-0.6 percent by March 2025.  On back of this, Pramod Gubbi, co-founder of Marcellus Investment Managers believes private sector banks, despite the recent underperformance, present an intriguing opportunity. &quot;These stocks have relatively low valuations compared to other sectors that have seen significant growth,&quot; he said.  FII comeback to propel bank rally  When the Fed started hiking rates in 2022, foreign investors sold around $17 billion of Indian equities. This, combined with the influx of domestic money, took the overall FII stake in Indian markets to a decadal low.  Also read: Eye on elections: Will FIIs flock to India and front-end investments?  According to a recent report by ICICI Securities, FII stake in Indian markets fell to 16.5 percent as of November 2023, hitting its lowest since 2012, while it had peaked at 20.18 percent in 2009.  Financials, with a weightage of more than 33 percent in the Nifty 50, will be the first hunting ground for FPIs when they resume their purchases in Indian markets in a big way, believe analysts.

HDFC,2024-02-02T13:46:30+05:30,Veer Sharma,7 stocks that can deliver over 30% returns to make you rich in 2024,"Strong fundamentals, and a robust outlook make the stocks an attractive proposition for investors. ","With two key events - the Union Budget and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting out of the way, investors will shift focus back to earnings and company fundamentals to choose and invest in quality stocks.  Company fundamentals, valuations and growth forecasts are likely to play a greater role in investors' stock selection. Here are seven stocks that still offer solid upside potential of over 30 percent, with reasonable valuations, and robust growth outlook.  Adani Enterprises | CMP: Rs 3,153  Cantor Fitzgerald has a buy call with a target price of Rs 4,369  The flagship firm of the Adani Group has started to regain investor confidence after the apex court cleared the air for the company. Experts suggest that risk-reward is in favour of the investors at current levels and the company is the most reliable for bringing energy resources into India (- this needs to be attributed). Its current valuation is largely driven by three main segments namely airports, roads, and its new energy ecosystem. Adani Enterprises shares have jumped over 43 percent in the past three months.  HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,466   CLSA has a buy call with a target price of Rs 2,025  Notwithstanding near-term concerns over strain on the lender's net interest margin and sluggish deposits post its mega-merger, HDFC Bank's sharp slump in January has turned its valuations attractive. Analysts say that concerns over deposits and NIMs are an overall industry snag, and not specific to HDFC Bank. Moreover, analysts see the lender as a long-term growth story, with the potential to sail through the near-term headwinds as its merger settles down. HDFC Bank has delivered marginally negative returns in the past three months.  PVR Inox | CMP: Rs 1,434   HSBC has a buy call with a target price of Rs 2,140  After a rather dull 2022 for Bollywood, the multiplex company is gradually getting back on its feet. Analysts see light at the end of the tunnel and believe that the content pipeline in CY25 will improve. Global brokerage firm HSBC said that the business fundamentals have stabilised and most concerns are transient. Elara Securities said the company's concerns were overdone, adding that PVR-Inox has a healthy outlook in the medium term. PVR Inox has fallen nearly 10 percent in the past three months.  SBI Life Insurance | CMP: Rs 1,432   BNP Paribas has an outperform rating with a target price of Rs 2,450  The life insurer is one of the best bets out there in the insurance space. The company anticipates clocking in robust, industry-beating growth in the medium term, with solid VNB margins, that are likely to stick around 28 percent for FY24. Brokerages are also buying into the management's bullishness as they expect SBI Life to show margin resilience. The cherry on the cake is the stock's underperformance in the past three months, leaving room for a stronger comeback. The stock has gained 7 percent in the past three months, underperforming the benchmark Nifty's 15 percent gains.  Cyient | CMP: Rs 1,939   Morgan Stanley has an overweight call with a target price of Rs 2,700  Analysts at Morgan Stanley suggest a robust fourth quarter amid demand visibility in key verticals such as connectivity and aerospace. In the previous quarters, communications bottoming out was a positive for the analysts, who are of the view that the strong performance from different verticals has made the outlook promising. Cyient shares have surged 17 percent in the past three months.  Asian Paints | CMP: Rs 2,929   HSBC has a buy call with a target price of Rs 4,020  After a stellar October-December quarter, analysts see the growth outlook as strong, and expect price wars to stabilise in the coming quarters. HSBC believes that fears of competition-based prices are exaggerated. As for the rural demand, the monsoon coupled with an uptick in government spending and moderating inflation is likely to bring in positivity for the rural economy. Asian Paints has lost 0.4 percent in the past three months.  Sunteck Realty | CMP: Rs 470   YES Securities has a buy call with a target price of Rs 586  In recent years, Sunteck Realty has showcased an impressive track record of acquiring projects and ramped up its execution capabilities. A strong balance sheet, strong upcoming cash flow and a consolidating market make management optimistic about doubling its under-execution pipeline to Rs 600 bn in 3 years, making the stock a favourite among analysts. Meanwhile, current valuations also make the risk-reward favourable for Sunteck Realty, with new project additions being the key growth drivers. Shares of Sunteck Realty are up 7 percent in the past three months.

Not really, say analysts","On January 29, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) single-handedly contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation.  ","A 6 percent rally in Reliance Industries on January 29 does not really indicate a comeback for largecap stocks, analysts told Moneycontrol. Money is simply flowing from one largecap to another as foreign investors are recasting their portfolios, they argued.  On January 29, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) alone contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation, while ONGC, Adani Enterprises, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, HDFC Bank and Coal India together contributed over 26 percent to the rally.  &quot;Reliance benefits from three things: Zee-Sony merger fallout, refining margins shaping well, and new energy vertical scaling up. It is a very stock-specific move,&quot; said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Direct.  Also Read: RIL rally triggered by funds taking refuge in ‘strong stock’ to hedge against short positions  &quot;I don't think the Reliance move indicates a trend reversal for largecaps, though largecaps are a lot more attractive than midcaps from a risk-reward perspective. Till the results season pans out, it will be a lot of stock-specific moves, I believe,&quot; Pandey said.  RIL strong, other heavyweights weak  The sheer weight of Reliance Industries on the Nifty 50, which was 9.2 percent as of end-December, means that any further rally in the stock should propel the benchmark index further, in theory. But, other heavyweights like HDFC Bank and TCS are not showing enough strength for the index to move forward decisively, said analysts.  HDFC Bank is down 14 percent in the past one month while TCS is up barely 0.16 percent. As of December-end, HDFC Bank had 13.52 percent weightage on the index, TCS had 4.5 percent.  HDFC Bank shares have seen a sharp sell-off after its Q3 FY24 results. The bank reported a key miss in net interest margins (NIM) due to the low deposit growth and higher cost of funds. Higher provisions and decadal low earnings per share (EPS) growth in Q3 are also contributing to the decline in shares.  All IT companies, including TCS and Infosys, continued to post soft numbers in Q3.  Also Read: HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie  On the other hand, the recent surge in Singapore GRMs (gross refining margins) indicates a positive outlook for RIL's oil-to-chemicals business, said independent analyst Prakash Diwan.  This marks a valuation reset for RIL, which is currently under-owned by FIIs, he said. &quot;As FIIs sell HDFC Bank, IT and FMCG stocks due to bleak outlook, they will redirect funds elsewhere. And, RIL will be a big beneficiary. FIIs can move out of some stocks but cannot move out of Indian markets as a whole, so money is now going to RIL,&quot; Diwan added.  Where is Nifty headed next?  With the Interim Budget just a couple of months away, the Q3 results season still playing out, and valuations slightly out of the comfort zone, the Nifty 50 is expected to remain rangebound.  Going ahead, similar erratic movements may persist ahead of key events, said analysts at Angel One. Immediate resistance for the Nifty is apparent around the 21,850 - 21,950 zone, while immediate support has shifted higher towards the 21,600-21,550 zone.

HDFC,2024-01-29T17:47:06+05:30,Lovisha Darad,"LIC's proposed stake buyout in HDFC Bank 'well-timed', has limited downside","LIC’s increased stake will prove to be a `value buy,’ shoring up the fortunes of HDFC which is emerging from its post-merger challenges","After a week of heavy selloff, HDFC Bank shares gained two percent to touch Rs 1,462 per share on January 29 on the back of Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) nod to Life Insurance Corporation's (LIC's) request of additional stake buyout. RBI allowed LIC to buy up to a 9.99 percent stake in the private sector lender from its current hold of 5.2 percent. This will be sentimentally positive for the stock and any downside from here on would be limited, said analysts.  &quot;We expect HDFC Bank stock to recover current losses and jump back by 15 percent in the next one year,&quot; said Chokkalingam G, Founder at Equinomics Research. He said that the bank is increasing its focus on rural and semi-urban areas and this will prove to be the next growth levers.  Shares of HDFC Bank tumbled 14 percent after the lender's Q3 financials came below Street estimates. Factors like fall in earnings per share (EPS), margin strain and sluggish deposit growth contributed to the negative sentiment around the stock. As a result, Bank Nifty, wherein it carries a 40 percent weightage also declined by over a percent.  ALSO READ: HDFC Bank stock gains 2% after LIC gets RBI nod to buy 4.8% additional stake  LIC's additional stake buyout in HDFC Bank is a 'value-buy', say experts  Market experts believe that LIC's proposed additional stake buyout of 4.8 percent comes at a time when the lender's stock valuation turned attractive post its steep fall. They believe that the buyout would be gradual in process, spread over a one-year time frame and not an immediate one-time acquisition.  &quot;LIC will start buying its approved additional stake in HDFC Bank in a slow manner. Since HDFC Bank's valuations have turned attractive from historical averages, it is most likely expected that LIC will complete the rest of its acquisition,&quot; said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.  Currently, HDFC Bank stock trades at 2.4-2.5 times (x) price-to-book (PB) value as against historical averages of 4xPB value, said analysts.  The RBI has advised LIC to complete its approved shareholding in HDFC Bank within a period of one year, that is by January 24, 2025. LIC’s current stake at HDFC Bank is valued at nearly Rs 50,000 crore. So another round of Rs 50,000 crore fresh buyout will be done gradually, added Chokkalingam G of Equinomics Research.  Kaitav Shah, lead BFSI analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities sees LIC's additional stake approval in HDFC Bank as a 'value buy.' He believes that LIC's support will bode well for the stock that saw merger challenges this quarter.  &quot;Though we expect merger pangs to persist for the next couple of quarters, the bank may come out as winner once it balances its margin and growth pain. We will take another year to assess the bank's profitability due to its recent merger, hence, sharing a 'hold' call,&quot; he told CNBC-TV18.

HDFC,2024-01-29T08:29:35+05:30,Moneycontrol News,HDFC Bank stock gains 2% after LIC gets RBI nod to buy 4.8% additional stake,"It will take LIC's stake in the private sector bank to 9.99 percent. The insurer has to complete the transaction by January 24, 2025","The HDFC Bank stock, which has been under pressure after Q3 results, gained 2 percent to Rs 1,462 per share on January 29 after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) to acquire an additional 4.8 percent stake in the lender, taking its stake to 9.99 percent.  The stock has crashed 14 percent after the private sector lender reported its December quarter results. Margin strain, fall in earnings per share (EPS) and slower-than-expected deposit growth have hit the sentiment.  The RBI allowed LIC to acquire the shareholding by January 24, 2025, the bank said in an exchange filing. LIC must also ensure that its aggregate holding does not exceed 9.99 percent of the paid-up share capital or voting rights of the bank.  ALSO READ: RBI allows LIC to acquire up to 9.99% stake in HDFC Bank  In the third quarter, HDFC Bank's net interest income (NII) grew 4 percent on-quarter, led by a 4.9 percent sequential growth in gross advances, while its net profit was up 2.5 percent on-quarter supported by bulky treasury gains and favourable tax write-backs of Rs 1,500 crore.  Higher cost of funds, or borrowing costs, however, limited expansion in net interest margins (NIMs) for the banking giant, keeping them flat sequentially at 3.6 percent in Q3FY24.  Analysts at HSBC have a &quot;buy&quot; call on the lender but reduced the target price to Rs 1,950 from Rs 2,080, saying they see few levers for NIM expansion.  &quot;We moderate NIM expansion to 15 bps (basis points) over FY24-26 versus 30 bps earlier.

HDFC,2024-01-28T07:42:41+05:30,Jigar Patel,"Bulls likely to back HDFC Bank, Greaves Cotton, Rain Industries for return up to 21% in short term","Expert anticipates a strong rebound in the Nifty Bank index during the February 2024 derivative series if the 45,000–44,000 support holds.","By Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi  The domestic markets remained highly volatile even though the week was shortened due to couple of trading holidays. Domestic markets were still under pressure, especially because of poor numbers from a few major players. The Nifty index had a high near 21,750 before closing near 21,200 with a decent loss for the second consecutive week.  During past sessions, the benchmark index Nifty found support at 21,150, which then led to a massive rise from there. Interestingly, the index has reversed from the support of a bullish Wolfe Wave formation. Based on the pattern, the index may revisit the 21,700–21,800 zone in the upcoming week if the recent low near 21,150 is not broken. In the worst-case scenario, we anticipate that the index will take support below 21,150, close to the 20,900 zone, where multiple supports are placed and the AB=CD pattern is completed.  The 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average 44,570) of the Nifty Bank index has been retested, and we anticipate that this zone will serve as support in the upcoming sessions. Overall, we anticipate a strong rebound in the Nifty Bank index during the February 2024 derivative series if the 45,000–44,000 support holds.  Here are three buy calls for short term:  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,435 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 | Target: Rs 1,550 | Return: 8 percent  Since the last 2 years or so, the said counter has been rejected six times from Rs 1,725–1,750 zone and is currently placed near Rs 1,430 mark. Currently, HDFC Bank has taken timely support near the October 2022 low of around Rs 1,380. Coincidentally, it is 200 DEMA, thus making it a viable buy at the current juncture.  The fall from January 17, 2024, to January 23, 2024, has witnessed decreasing volume (refer to the chart), which hints that bears are losing steam. On January 24, 2024, HDFC Bank made a classic Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern accompanied by decent volume, which cannot be ignored as of now.  Also, in the hourly time frame, it has managed to generate Bull divergence on stochastic. Based on the technical setup, one can accumulate the said counter in the range of Rs 1,420–1,450 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,380 and a target of Rs 1,550.    Rain Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 175.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 155 | Target: Rs 210 | Return: 20 percent  Since the last 2 months or so, the said counter has been consolidating between Rs 145 and Rs 155. Recently, it has given a breakout from the said range on a weekly closing basis, which is looking lucrative. Having said that, it has also formed a bullish GARTLEY pattern, which is 1.38 years old, thus making it more reliable.  Also, it has violated a couple of trendlines. The best part about this bullish reversal is that every bottom has bought with huge volume bars, which indicates bullish bias in the counter.  On the indicator front, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) has given a trendline violation, which further affirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, we advised traders and investors to go long in the range of Rs 170-176 with an upside target of Rs 210, and the stop-loss would be placed at Rs 155 on a daily close basis.  Note: The Gartley pattern is a Harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, which help traders, identify reaction highs and lows.    Greaves Cotton: Buy | LTP: Rs 165 | Stop-Loss: Rs 143 | Target: Rs 200 | Return: 21 percent  The entire 2023 year went by, consolidating around 100–200 DEMA (exponential moving average), followed by recent bear trendline violations (refer to the chart). Also, volume is picking up from lower levels, thus making it attractive at current levels.  On the indicator front, the weekly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has given a bull cross just near the zero line, which further affirms our bullish stance. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 163–166 with a target of Rs 200 and a stop-loss of Rs 143 on a daily basis.

HDFC,2024-01-25T21:35:24+05:30,Moneycontrol News,RBI allows LIC to acquire up to 9.99% stake in HDFC Bank,"&quot;LIC has been advised by RBI to acquire the aforesaid major shareholding in the bank within one year i.e. by January 24, 2025,&quot; the bank said","The Reserve Bank of India has allowed Life Insurance Corp. of India to acquire as much as 9.99 percent of HDFC Bank, the country's largest private lender told stock exchanges on January 25.  &quot;LIC has been advised by RBI to acquire the aforesaid major shareholding in the Bank within a period of one year i.e. by January 24, 2025,&quot; HDFC Bank said in an exchange filing. &quot;Further, LIC must ensure that the aggregate holding in the Bank does not exceed 9.99 percent of the paid-up share capital or voting rights of the Bank at all times,&quot; said HDFC Bank.  LIC owns a 5.19 percent stake in the bank, according to the lender's shareholding pattern as of December 31.  As per the bank's exchange notification,  the RBI informed the decision to the LIC through a letter dated  January 25, under which LIC can acquire an aggregate holding up to 9.99 percent of the paid-up share capital or voting rights of HDFC Bank Limited.  The announcement is likely to come as positive news to HDFC Bank's shareholders. Recently, HDFC Bank shares had witnessed heavy sell off pushing the shares to near 52-week lows, post the announcement of the bank's third quarter earnings. Some analysts speculate that the sell off is due to foreign investors panicking over a recent Sebi proposal concerning foreign portfolio investors.  However, earlier in the day the bank said that there was no evidence suggesting that the selling by foreign portfolio investors was related to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) guidelines.  “No evidence to suggest any FPI selling is related to the Sebi circular. Understand that companies with no identifiable promoters won’t be impacted by the Sebi circular,” the bank told CNBC-TV18 a day after the channel reported, citing sources from the bank, that the stock was a victim of selloff due to the regulator's guidelines on beneficial owner disclosure.  “Sebi's understanding that BO disclosure rules not to be applied to companies with no identifiable promoter needs to be communicated in writing,” sources said earlier.  December quarter numbers  On January 25, HDFC Bank's shares closed at Rs 1435.30 apiece on the BSE, down 1.41 percent from the previous close, while the Benchmark equity index Sensex closed 0.51 percent down at 70,700.67 points.  HDFC Bank, on January 16, reported a net profit of Rs 16,372 crore for the October-December quarter of 2023-24, which marks a 33.5 percent jump from Rs 12,259 crore clocked a year ago.  The net profit, at Rs 16,372 crore, came almost in line with the market estimates of Rs 16,427 crore. The net interest income (NII) of Rs 28,470 crore, which increased by 23.9 percent as compared to Rs 22,990 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.  The bank's gross non-performing assets (NPA) stood at 1.26 percent, up from 1.23 percent last year. On the other hand, net NPA for the quarter stood at 0.31 percent compared to 0.33 percent last year. Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, Chief Financial Officer, HDFC Bank said that the bank has historically seen an improvement in its asset quality.  However, investors were not enthused by the numbers as reflected in the drop in share price in the subsequent days.  During the quarter, the bank's provisions rose to Rs 4,216 crore, up by 50 percent. Srinivasan said that the provision number include contingent provisions of around Rs 1,212 crore on account of investments in alternative investment funds.  Total advances of the bank jumped 62.4 percent to Rs 24.69 lakh crore. Domestic retail loans of the bank grew by 111 percent, commercial and rural loans of the bank grew by 31.4 percent and corporate and wholesale loans (excluding non-individual loans of HDFC Ltd. of approximately Rs 98,900 crore) grew by 11.2 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbi-allows-lic-to-acquire-up-to-9-99-stake-in-hdfc-bank-12127521.html

HDFC,2024-01-25T08:07:29+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra,"Market fall rooted in stock-specific negatives, not Sebi FPI disclosure norms","While some selling may have been the result of FPIs paring stake to comply with the new regulations, analysts say the big falls over the past few sessions were triggered by stock-specific negative news and overvaluation","Market chatter may have blamed the fall over the past few sessions on foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) selling down stakes to comply with the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi's) new disclosure norms, a Moneycontrol analysis shows that is not be the full story.  Of the top 10 biggest losers from the BSE 200 list, three stocks — Zee Entertainment, IndusInd Bank and LTIMindtree —  are part of corporate groups that have FPIs who are not exempt from making additional disclosures on beneficial ownership.  Of the top 25 losers, eight are exposed to FPIs which have more than 50 percent of their corpus invested in their respective corporate groups.    While some selling may have happened from FPIs paring stake to comply with the new regulations, analysts said the big fall over the past few sessions was triggered by stock-specific negative news.  &quot;The FPI selloff quantum in the past few days is significantly lesser than Sebi's estimate of FPI AUM required to make additional disclosures. The counters are also different. The ones beaten down most have low FPI ownership,&quot; said Nirav Karkera, head of research, Fisdom.  Also Read: MC Explains | What are Sebi FPI norms and how are they linked to the market fall?  Sebi initially estimated that the quantum of FPI stake that will have to comply with additional disclosure norms at around Rs 2.46 lakh crore. Sources at Sebi, however, told Moneycontrol that the amount was a conservative estimate. The amount was now significantly lower despite a significant escalation in the market’s overall market-cap, as more FPIs got eliminated on additional exemption criteria.  Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities, said Sebi norms could be one of the triggers but one must also note that FIIs were selling across emerging markets (EMs).  &quot;The global FII view is to reduce exposure to EM equities, maybe because they feel markets are overvalued. India is also at the receiving end,&quot; he said.  During the January 15-23 period, the Nifty lost 4 percent and the Nifty Midcap 100 2.5 percent. FIIs pulled out Rs 32,000 crore and DIIs bought stake worth Rs 17,000 crore.  After a very strong rally and the Nifty scaling 22,000, the markets had moved to an overbought situation and needed an excuse to pullback a bit, Gaurav Dua, SVP - Head Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan told Moneycontrol.  &quot;The volatility in global markets and the post results correction in some heavyweights in banking sector seem to have provided the required trigger for the correction. The reports related to FPI norms seem to have only added to weakness in sentiments,&quot; Dua said.    Stock-specific triggers  Much of the market fall has been triggered by negative news about specific stocks. Zee Entertainment Enterprises, for instance, saw a 38 percent drawdown largely on the back of the Sony deal fallout. Data compiled by Prime Database shows only two FPIs holding more than 50 percent of their corpus in Essel group, which amounts to total of Rs 63 crore. Zee's total market cap loss over this period is more than Rs 7,000 crore.  In the case of HDFC, two FPIs have concentrated holdings — Aberdeen and Invesco — amounting to Rs 18,210 crore. Both are exempt from making additional disclosures, as per Sebi. HDFC Bank has fallen close to 15 percent after it announced its third quarter results as the Street was disappointed with its margin performance.  Also Read: Expect some housing incentives in Budget, prefer private over PSU banks: Macquarie’s Suresh Ganapathy  Oberoi Realty, which does not have concentrated FPI holding, has tumbled 10 percent in the past weak after its December quarter net profit tanked close to 49 percent from last year. On the other hand, Adani group companies that have highest amount of concentrated FPI bets have fallen between 2 and 5 percent.  For several stocks, one cannot make a direct connection between concentrated FPI holding and the recent selloff. That said, the numbers could be an under representation of opaque structures as they include only FPIs with greater than 1 percent holding. Data for this study was compiled by Prime database, based on public disclosures.  What are Sebi FPI norms and what are the deadlines?  Sebi wants additional disclosures from FPIs to prevent companies from manipulating the rules on minimum public shareholding and also to prevent overseas entities from indirectly controlling Indian companies through a chain or web of shell firms.  Disclosures on beneficial ownership have to be made by FPIs whose 50 percent of equity assets under management are invested in a single Indian corporate group, or FPIs that have invested over Rs 25,000 crore in the Indian stock market.  Sources on January 24 said there is no immediate deadline or cliff for FPIs to liquidate any holdings.  Also Read: Sebi FPI norms: Quantum less than projected, no immediate deadline to liquidate, say sources  FPIs which meet the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of October 31, 2023 have time till January-end to rebalance their holdings, if they so wish. &quot;If they continue to meet the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of January end, they shall be required to make the additional disclosures within 30 trading days,&quot; sources said.

HDFC,2024-01-24T22:41:11+05:30,Latha Venkatesh,'Our franchise is solid; nothing can stop this juggernaut': Top HDFC Bank sources,"HDFC Bank management believes it is a fine growth machine, and the team can create another HDFC Bank every four years, top sources at the private lender told CNBC-TV18. Speaking about the recent fall, the bank said its stock has also been a victim of the misgivings about SEBI’s rule on disclosure of beneficial ownership.","Days after the bank’s stock was pummelled after its disappointing numbers, top executives at HDFC Bank, speaking exclusively to CNBC-TV18, said they are confident that the bank’s deposit and loan-generating capacity remains solid and that it will return to its old trajectory in the medium term.  &quot;Our franchise is solid, the team is working hard, and our vision is clear,&quot; said one of the top executives to CNBC-TV18. &quot;There will be road bumps, but nothing can stop this juggernaut,&quot; he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.  A key takeaway from these bankers is that margins will be given top priority. They said they may allow some asset sales to substitute the maturing deposits of the old HDFC. One of the bankers we spoke to explained that as the old HDFC borrowings get replaced with bank deposits, margins will rise. &quot;We will give top priority to margins,&quot; he said, importantly adding that they may substitute some of the high-cost borrowing with the asset sale. &quot;Optically, advances may be lower, but I won't demotivate my team.&quot;  When reminded of MD Sashi Jagdishan’s promise that &quot;the bank will create an HDFC Bank every four years,&quot; the bankers said that goal remains intact. One of them pointed out: &quot;We are only two quarters into the merger; we have till 2027.&quot; He explained that their growth plans faced a bump because of the RBI’s liquidity tightening policy, which may continue for the next few months.  Another top honcho pointed out that the bank still accounts for 19% of incremental deposits created in the banking system as of December end, and this is true for the last nine months and the last few years.  The first banker pointed out that HDFC Bank has had a certain growth trajectory for 20 years, but with the merger on July 1, &quot;it's a new starting point.&quot; For six lakh crore rupees of assets, the bank had zero CRR (cash reserve ratio). Also, while the erstwhile HDFC Bank had only 8% of its funds in the form of borrowings, with HDFC's merger, borrowings shot up to 21%, and so the cost of funds rose.  &quot;We are going to reclaim the old pace, but we don't want to box ourselves into a number,&quot; he said when asked to guide on margins. &quot;But we are sure of the direction: on a secular basis, our margins will rise from 3.4% to 3.5% and so on,&quot; he said.  The bankers also pointed out that, like HDFC Bank’s deposit-creating ability, its ability to create quality is also best in class. &quot;Our USP of credit quality remains and will be visible when the cycle changes,&quot; he said, adding that now all banks show good asset quality because of a goldilocks point in the cycle. &quot;We will stand out when the cycle turns,&quot; he said.  A part of the disappointment with HDFC Bank's Q3 numbers also came from the fact that the bank said it would open only around 900 branches, against an earlier promise of 1500 branches. The second banker we spoke to said that the market is probably linking the branch opening to the bank's ability to create deposits. He explained that there is no such link. &quot;In fact, new branches don’t give us much deposit; branches older than 10 years give us 10 times the deposits a new branch gives us; branches over 15 years old give us 25 times the deposits,&quot; he said.  He explained that the opening of branches is getting stymied by an RBI requirement that 25% of incremental branches should be opened in unbanked areas, and as of now, there is no clear data on unbanked areas. &quot;One belief is that there are no unbanked left. India is pretty much adequately banked by a branch or BC. That’s one area with which we are grappling and waiting for clarification from RBI.&quot;  Part of the reason for the HDFC Bank stock's near 15% fall was because of ambiguity over SEBI’s rule that FPIs with more than 50% exposure in one group and those with over $3 billion in assets have to disclose all their beneficial owners. SEBI has since clarified that this rule doesn’t apply to FPIs that have concentrated exposure in a company with no identifiable promoter, like HDFC or ICICI groups. But the bankers said this intent has not been put in black and white and so there is confusion at the depository’s end. In fact, some of our foreign fund investors have written to us, asking us to get clarity from SEBI,&quot; said one of the bankers.  To sum up, HDFC Bank's 8,000 branches are raring to go to originate loans and liabilities, the bankers said. The India growth story is robust, and like in the last 25 years, in the next 25 too, we will double every four years, short-term gyrations notwithstanding.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/our-franchise-is-solid-nothing-can-stop-this-juggernaut-top-hdfc-bank-sources-12120391.html

Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries  Overall Pharma sector has continued to outperform since many weeks. Sun Pharma made a fresh record high in the previous session. The stock continued to rise despite of broader markets falling.  On the below chart, we can see prices have broken above the upward sloping channel and shown strong positive momentum. The overall trend for the stock is positive unless we see close below the 50-day moving average which is near Rs 1,280 levels.  In short, trend for Sun Pharma is positive. Use buy on dips approach to ride the trend with the target of Rs 1,480 levels. While on the downside Rs 1,280 is the crucial support level.    Chalet Hotels  Chalet Hotels has continued to show strong rise since May 2023. Prices are still gaining momentum and is not showing any slow down as can be seen from RSI (relative strength index).  As shown on daily chart we can see strong breakout above the channel and after retest there is again attempt to move higher. Break above yesterday’s high near Rs 775, the up move can resume in this stock for a move to Rs 810 levels. On downside, channel support is near Rs 710 levels.    HDFC Bank  HDFC Bank has shown a sharp fall post the disappointing quarterly results. Since then not a single candle has given a close above previous day’s high which suggests weakness.  On the below chart, the red vernicle lines represent 53 days’ cycle. We can see most of the lows are formed on our cycle and after almost every 53 period, HDFC Bank has shown a positive reversal. Currently, Time cycle of 53 days is due by January 25. So, post January 25, we can expect some buying.  However, price action is a must to confirm the same and for that we need a close above Rs 1,475 levels. A close above it can suggest that short term bottom has formed.  In short, trend for this stock is still negative. Any break below Rs 1,400 can drag the price lower towards Rs 1,340 levels. Whereas a close above Rs 1,475 can result into a short covering which can lift the price higher towards Rs 1,520-1,530 levels.

Agrawal pointed out that banks are seeing a deposit flight in low-cost savings accounts because people now prefer to deploy that money in stock markets. This reduces the mix of the deposits and raises deposit cost liability for the bank, putting NIM under pressure.  Agrawal pointed out that the saving grace for the banks is the loan demand, which is witnessing a strong demand. “If loan grows at 18-20 percent and the system growth is 15 percent, then you can grow at 20-25 percent in terms of volume and that gives you operating leverage. This combination of volume and operating leverage cushions the pressure on NIM and hence the profitability could be saved”, he added.  However, he also said the market needs to watch how bad the deposit flight will be in the coming quarter.  Commenting on the results so far, Agrawal said the overall earnings aggregate looks tepid because the demand is weak. He says to watch out for the upcoming earnings of automobiles, defence and capital goods to get a full picture of the earrings aggregate.  Speaking on Ayodhya, Agrawal says the city could have daily flights charted from metro cities and other parts of the country, which would lead to a boom in the aviation sector and the overall economy of Ayodhya.  Agrawal also said that the government will push out for more divestments as valuations in the equity markets are at the highest and divestment is necessary to cool the markets down and bring sanity to the proceedings.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/concerns-around-banking-could-slow-down-earnings-for-bfsi-segment-says-raamdeo-agrawal-12109071.html

","Tax exemption on capital gains bonds is at a limit of Rs 50 lakh, and there has been a long-standing demand to extend that to Rs 1 crore. Suresh Ganapathy, Managing Director, Macquarie Capital, believes there is a possibility it will be addressed in the upcoming interim budget because real estate prices have gone up.  Ganapathy has been tracking the financial services sector for over two decades now. At the current juncture, he believes private sector banks are better placed than public sector banks. “Private sector banks are better in terms of digital banking, branch expansion, etc. Moreover, HDFC Bank is making life difficult for everybody in the system owing to merger-related needs,” he said.  Also Read: HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie  Edited excerpts:  What are your expectations for the banking sector from the interim budget? Or do you think it's going to be a non-event? I don’t expect too many announcements in this budget. There could possibly be further housing incentives or extensions of housing benefits from a taxation standpoint for the consumer. So at best, that is something I expect. Anyway, over the past few years, there has not been any capital allocation towards public sector banks because the health of the public sector banks has been pretty good. I think that trend will continue.  What are your expectations regarding housing incentives? Nothing major. However, the tax exemption on capital gains bonds is at a limit of Rs 50 lakh, and there has been a long-standing demand to extend that to Rs 1 crore. There is a possibility that it gets extended because real estate prices have gone up. Currently, the interest exemption on housing loans is Rs 2 lakh. That might also be partially increased. So, basic tinkering like that.  Also Read: 68% HNIs, 43% retail investors flip IPO trades in first week, says Sebi chair Madhabi Buch  A few weeks ago, a government document on the merger of four public sector banks was doing the rounds. Do you anticipate any announcements on that front? In the past, the government, may not directly but indirectly, has indicated that they would like to reduce the number of public sector banks and make them larger. Some of these PSU banks are still small, and therefore, merger is an inevitable option. It may not happen necessarily through a budget speech, but that's the medium-term goal of the government.  But why is that? If all the public sector banks have healthy asset quality now and no further capitalisation is needed from the government side… Where are the people to run these organisations? The existing management is getting old. There’s a musical chair taking place within the PSU banks. A’s ED (executive director) is moving to B. B’s ED is switching to A. That's a big challenge over a long time.  And from the RBI’s perspective, it is easier to manage a few large ones than multiple small ones.  Also Read: Sebi probing mule accounts, faulty IPO applications, 3 cases under scanner, says Buch  So, what's your pecking order now? Private sector banks over PSU banks, what do you prefer? We clearly prefer private sector banks over public sector banks. Look at the books over the past five years. PSU banks have lost market share and deposits — both CASA as well as term deposits. Anyway, they were losing market share on loans, and I think that will continue. The private sector banks are better in terms of digital banking, branch expansion, etc. Moreover, HDFC Bank is making life difficult for everybody in the system owing to merger-related needs. So, private sector banks will continue to grow faster than public sector banks.  Over the next six to 12 months, ECL (expected credit loss) guidelines will also come through, and private sector banks have better wherewithal to manage that compared to public sector banks.  And when the ECL guidelines kick in, will there be a sudden bump up in provisions for all banks? The RBI has given a five-year amortisation period for all the banks in the system once these ECL provisions are quantified. To that extent, there is time for banks to digest the impact. Private sector banks have contingent provisions that they can use to tide over this change and, thus, are in a better position. However, stock markets react differently. The moment it comes through, there could be a sharp reaction.  Also Read: Cycle of local players entering market almost over, says HUL's Rohit Jawa  Is there any investment case for old banks, like Karnataka Bank or Federal Bank? The thing about these old banks is that they are regionalised and localised. They are not pan-India. As long as they remain small and focus on their local markets, they have a basic level of strong customer franchise, and they keep getting those liabilities — all is good. They might not grow at 25-30 percent, but they can still grow around 14-15 percent and maintain profitability for the foreseeable future. They will never be in a position to topple the big private-sector banks.  But they should stay in the main domain areas where they have a better presence. For instance, City Union Bank in Tamil Nadu and Federal Bank in Kerala have a good catchment in terms of NRI customers. The niche is unlikely to be disrupted in a big way, and they can deliver moderate performance over the next four to five years.  Among private sector banks, what is your pecking order? We believe the best earnings growth will occur next year amongst the frontline top private sector banks. We expect around 15-20 percent earnings growth. So, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, and Axis Bank will be my top picks in the space.

Of the 422 actively-managed equity funds that hold the banking stock, 27 diversified funds exited the stock over the past six months"," HDFC Bank was the most-owned stock in the Indian mutual funds industry until December. While the stock has been being part of the top 5 holdings of many equity oriented schemes, some schemes have pruned exposure to the stock over the last few months. Twenty-seven schemes, or 6 percent, of the actively managed schemes that held HDFC Bank shares have exited the stock in the last six months. Most of them exited in August and September. Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities, says the lender's provisional merged Q1 results and the near-term outlook were subdued. Secondly, the managers of the mid and small-cap funds had the option to move from stable stocks to &quot;momentum ones&quot;.   Quant Mutual Fund exited the stock in August. Sandeep Tandon, CIO, Quant Mutual Fund, said “Since our Predictive Analytics models are showing that the relevance of the banking is declining and hence the valuation multiple will decline, and risk appetite indicators started declining from September 2023. Even liquidity indicators also deteriorated around that time and hence we offloaded HDFC Bank from our portfolio”.   The HDFC Bank stock plunged as much as 12 percent after Q3 numbers disappointed investors. Kranthi Bathini, Director-Equity strategy, WealthMills Securities, said the main reason for the underperformance is that it is taking time to get the full benefits from the merger between HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd. The net interest margin (NIM) of HDFC Bank was on par with the previous quarter's 3.4 percent, disappointing the market, experts say. The benefits of the merger will take time to materialise, a factor that has led some funds to pare exposure to HDFC Bank.

But these headwinds are transient in nature, said Rahul Malani, research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.  &quot;We remain 'overweight' on banks that can sustain improved performance despite emerging headwinds.

For successful mutual fund investments, knowledge about asset allocation and market timing is essential. And the next time a bellwether stock falls on a given day, just stay invested. Keep monitoring, though.","The sharp 12 percent fall in the share price of HDFC Bank over the last four trading sessions has again raised questions over actively managed mutual funds mirroring their respective benchmarks in the Indian asset management industry.  HDFC Bank is among the most-owned stocks in the Indian equity markets. To put things in perspective, there were 539 mutual fund schemes, including active and passive, with a total investment of Rs 2.17 lakh crore in the private sector lender as of December end.  Of this, 420 schemes are actively managed with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 1.36 lakh crore, as per data available with Value Research.  This is probably because HDFC Bank has the highest weightage in the Nifty 50 index among all the stocks, at 13.52 percent. These weightages can change with different benchmarks. For example, HDFC Bank has 11.31 percent weightage in the Nifty 100 index and 29.39 percent in the Nifty Bank index.  Also read | Is HDFC Bank a safety net for mid-cap and small-cap funds? Not always  While passive schemes such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds have to adhere to the assigned weightages while constructing portfolios, active funds can alter their allocations based on fund managers’ judgement.  These weightages can then, in turn, have a proportionate impact in terms of returns.  Schemes with biggest impact  On January 17, 18, 19 and 20, shares of HDFC Bank slumped 12 percent in total, eroding nearly Rs 1.5 trillion of investors' wealth.    Returns-wise, passive sectoral funds based on the banking and financial services theme took the biggest hit on January 17 due to their large exposure to HDFC Bank. Schemes such as ICICI Prudential Nifty Bank ETF, Kotak Nifty Bank ETF, SBI Nifty Bank ETF, HDFC Nifty Bank ETF, and Axis Nifty Bank ETF slumped more than 4 percent, as per data available with ACE MF.  In terms of exposure, SBI Mutual Fund has the biggest investment in HDFC Bank, both via active and passive schemes, at Rs 62,416 crore, or 7.04 percent of the overall portfolio. To be sure, its largest scheme, the SBI Nifty ETF, is where the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation's (EPFO) incremental corpus gets invested. This is followed by HDFC MF at Rs 24,432 crore, or 4.19 percent of the portfolio, and UTI MF at Rs 21,626 crore, or 7.64 percent.    It has been seen that many actively managed funds choose to align their scheme portfolios with the respective benchmarks. But is that a good strategy?  Perils of benchmark hugging  Actively managed schemes such as Baroda BNP Paribas Banking and Financial Services, LIC MF Banking &amp;amp; Financial Services, Kotak Banking &amp;amp; Financial Services, and HDFC Banking &amp;amp; Financial Services took major hits on January 17.  Even when it comes to diversified schemes, those such as Tata Large Cap, SBI Bluechip Fund, and Bandhan Large Cap Fund, with their holdings of around 10 percent in HDFC Bank, fell up to 2 percent each on the day.  According to Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom, most actively managed mutual funds have kept a mandate that they will not be completely divergent from the benchmarks.  Also read | Your mutual fund can redeem your money in minutes. Here’s how  “From a risk standpoint, even if funds don't see value in a stock, they don't want to completely avoid exposure to something that is heavily represented on the index,” he said.  “However, (we should) understand that many fund managers target relative performance. Managers need to generate alpha, which is outperformance over the benchmark. In such a case, it is difficult to deviate significantly from the benchmark through exclusions. However, many have historically delivered superior returns through active management. So, constituent overlap with benchmarks and deviations through weightages are also practices that have worked for many,” Karkera said.  Some funds have less exposure to HDFC Bank in their portfolios. For example, schemes such as ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage, Kotak Flexicap, and HDFC Balanced Advantage have exposure in the range of 4-6 percent to the private sector lender.    Though rare, some mutual funds, such as Quant Mutual Fund, don’t have any allocations to HDFC Bank.  To be sure, mirroring or diverging from the benchmark doesn’t guarantee better returns, as mutual funds generate returns via stock selection and then timing the entry and exit.  Kirtan Shah, Founder of Credence Wealth Advisors, says that in the active mutual fund space, there are two types of fund managers: one, who are largely index-hugging with a little change here and there, and two, those who take very bold calls. “In the active space, you really want to be with somebody who takes active strategies, actively,” Shah said.  Can funds ignore benchmarks?  Fund managers try to align their portfolio weightages to the respective benchmarks, as a mutual fund is a relative-return product and performance is relative to the benchmark.  Also read | Midcap gems that large-cap funds added lately  “Funds cannot entirely eliminate a stock (that is, not invest anything in it), especially a stock like HDFC Bank, which has delivered consistently over the last 25 years. They have very little reason to do so. At best, they can tweak the allocation based on their preferences. HDFC and HDFC Ltd (erstwhile), have been bellwether stocks, belonging to a sector that was consistently growing and tightly tied to the India growth story. The merger between the two would have led to an increase in overall exposure,” said Deepak Chhabria, Chief Executive Officer &amp;amp; Director of Axiom Financial Services.  How should you react?  The answer: No.  While investing in mutual funds, reacting to the day-to-day performance of underlying stocks can be counterproductive. There are thousands of stocks on the exchanges, and they trade for around 250 days a year.  “Judging a mutual fund scheme based on a single month-end portfolio is also difficult. A scheme may hold a stock for 29 days and sell it on the last day, which would not reflect in the factsheet. So, you cannot look purely at the stock weightages and make a decision. The whole idea is that such events (the HDFC Bank stock fall) will keep happening; investors just need to stay the course and stay wiser,” said Amol Joshi, Founder, PlanRupee Investment Services.

However, they warned that the lender's shares could potentially extend their two-day drop of 11 percent.  HDFC Bank shares tumbled as investors were disappointed with flat margins, sluggish deposit growth, and lower earnings per share (EPS) in the fiscal third quarter. The stock was down 2 percent in the afternoon on January 18, extending the previous day’s 8 percent fall.  HDFC Bank stock price falling on knee-jerk reaction, but long-term view positive  &quot;Though HDFC Bank's margins disappointed in Q3, we expect gradual recovery led by portfolio mix shifting to retail lending,” said Dnyanada Vaidya, Research Analyst - BFSI at Axis Securities.  Experts said the current decline in HDFC stock price was just a knee-jerk reaction to weak Q3 results. The stock has the potential to outperform in the long run as merger synergies play out, said independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga.  &quot;We expect HDFC stock to run up to Rs 1,750-1,850 per share in the long-term but do not expect any immediate bounce-back in the near term. If overall market breadth declines, we can see the stock decline up to Rs 1,350 per share,&quot; he said.  HDFC Bank stock call: Current valuation attractive, a key source of comfort  “Valuations have turned attractive for the bank post this sharp correction and we maintain a 'buy' on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,975,&quot; said Dnyanada Vaidya of Axis Securities.  Having priced in all factors that could weigh down the earnings trajectory of HDFC Bank, Malani of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said that the stock's valuations appeared reasonable. &quot;We remain constructive on the bank with a mid-to-long-term perspective and retain a 'buy' call with a price target of Rs 1,900 per share,&quot; he added.  Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, too, noted attractive valuations at present, saying that the bank needs more time to deliver best-in-class return ratios. &quot;We maintain a 'buy' rating for HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 1,860 per share and value the bank at 2.5x book and 15x FY26E EPS for RoE at 16 percent and 15 percent CAGR,&quot; they wrote in a post-result review analysis.  ALSO READ: Daily Voice: HDFC Bank in consolidation phase, growth prospects intact, says Ladderup's Raghvendra Nath  Here’s why HDFC Bank stock fell after Q3 results: NIM falls flat  The key negative in HDFC Bank's Q3 report card was its core operating performance, said Rahul Malani, Deputy VP - Fundamental Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.  &quot;The lender's NIMs (net interest margins) were flat quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) versus expected improvement of 5-10 basis points (bps) as regulation on incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR) was withdrawn. On the liability side, the key challenge was higher credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio as it was 110 percent -- higher than the industry average,” he said.  An increase in the interest expenditure limited HDFC Bank's net interest income (NII) growth to 4 percent QoQ in Q3FY24, while prudential provisions towards alternate investment funds (AIFs) limited profit growth to 4 percent QoQ. The lender's higher cost of funds or borrowing costs constrained expansion in the margin, keeping that flat during the quarter.  ALSO READ: HDFC Bank: The worst may be over, but it's tough to reclaim its past glory  Deposit step-up, NIM re-rating essential growth levers for HDFC Bank  On the other hand, while the bank's loan growth was strong at 5 percent QoQ, the deposits grew moderately at 2 percent QoQ in Q3FY24. As a result, the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) rose to 110 percent versus 107 percent QoQ, which means that the bank needs to step up deposit growth to enable higher loan growth in the near-to-medium term.  An LDR of 80-90 percent is considered healthy for banks. A ratio higher than that means that the bank has to build reserves or in this case, deposits to meet unexpected contingencies.  HDFC Bank may see a gradual improvement in NIM, depending upon favourable loan mix, CASA accretion, and funding mix change, said analysts at ICICI Securities. The brokerage has an 'add' rating on HDFC Bank stock, with a target price of Rs 1,850 per share.

Not always,"Largecap stocks held by mid-cap and small-cap funds tend to cushion the fall whenever the market corrects. However, it is not a cause of concern for the long term investors"," The sharp single-day decline in the stock of HDFC Bank of over 8 percent on January 17 hit all those mutual fund (MF) schemes that have shares of the bank. Index funds tracking the Nifty 50 saw a single-day drop in their NAV by 2%, while the banking sector funds posted a loss of up to 3.5% on January 17. A total 532 equity-oriented MF schemes hold HDFC Bank shares in their portfolios, as of December 31, 2023. Of these, 422 are actively managed.   The allocation towards the stock of HDFC Bank by the overall Indian mutual fund industry stood at Rs 2.18 trillion, comprising about 7% of the overall equity AUM of Rs 31.5 trillion as of December 2023. Actively managed equity funds had a lion’s share of about 64% in it. But it’s not just the large-cap funds that have HDFC Bank shares. Quite a few small- and mid- cap funds also have the bank’s shares. Apart from their 65% of mandated allocation, mid-cap and small-cap funds have a leeway to allocate to large-cap stocks. Large-cap stocks tend to cushion the fall whenever the market corrects. Eight mid-cap funds and four small-cap funds held the exposure to the HDFC Bank as of December 2023. They registered a single-day loss of -0.6% to -1.4% on January 17. The allocation to the HDFC Bank was likely to contribute to the fall in the NAV of these funds on the day.

HDFC,2024-01-18T07:49:14+05:30,Moneycontrol News,HDFC Bank shares remain under pressure; down 11% in 2 days as Q3 results disappoint,HDFC Bank's fall came after the lender reported a key miss in net interest margins (NIM) in Q3FY24 due to higher cost of funds,"HDFC Bank shares continued to remain under pressure, slipping over 2 percent in afternoon deals Rs 1,499 per share on January 18 after its US-listed shares fell 9.1 percent overnight to $55.5, marking its biggest single-day drop since March 2020. In the last two days, the HDFC Bank ADR has suffered a plunge of over 15 percent, while HDFC Bank stock has tanked over 11 percent.  The weakness in HDFC Bank shares created a ripple effect on other banking stocks, particularly private sector lenders, driving the Bank Nifty index down 0.6 percent on January 18 noon trade.  The woes for the country's largest private lender began after it reported a key miss in net interest margins (NIM) in Q3FY24 due to higher cost of funds. Higher provisions and decadal low earnings per share (EPS) growth in Q3 also contributed to the decline.  Also read: MC Analysis: Top 5 takeaways from HDFC Bank’s Q3 earnings  While the management guided for NIM to bottom out gradually over the next few quarters, brokerages stayed unconvinced with the pace of improvement. Most of the analysts reduced their target price on the counter but retained a bullish call due to attractive valuations.  &quot;The lower liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), credit-to-deposit (CDR) bottleneck and slower deposit growth may squeeze NIMs going forward. We believe that the Street is concerned about the above factors. Nevertheless, we may witness recovery in the coming period. We have a 12-month price target of 1,700 for HDFC Bank,&quot; said Ajit Kabi, research analyst at LKP Securities.  The private sector lender's NIMs were flat QoQ at 3.6 percent in Q3FY24, whereas provisions jumped by 39 percent on a sequential basis. Apart from that, the bank's net interest income (NII) was up 4 percent QoQ and net profit rose moderately by 2.5 percent QoQ in Q3FY24.  In previous trading session, HDFC Bank stock saw the biggest single-day decline in over three years and also became the major drag behind the benchmark Nifty 50 index, where it commands the largest weightage of over 14 percent.

HDFC,2024-01-18T07:29:35+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Why this analyst sees more correction in HDFC Bank, predicts buying in IT stocks","Shitij Gandhi of SMC Global is not bearish on Bank Nifty. Bank Nifty could find support near 45,550 zone.","&quot;The rise in volumes with fall in price suggests a long unwinding into the stock which points towards further correction into HDFC Bank prices,&quot; Shitij Gandhi, senior technical research analyst at SMC Global Securities, said in an interaction with Moneycontrol.  Given the stock trading below Rs 1,600 levels, he advised traders to use wait and watch strategy.  However, on the IT space, Shitij, with more than 15 years of experience in technicals, says traders are shifting towards defensive space given the fall in equity markets. &quot;So we can see buying into the IT, most of the frontliner already given breakout to the chart.&quot;  Is it a great opportunity to buy into HDFC Bank?  HDFC Bank witnessed a steep correction of more than 8 percent on January 17 after its Q3FY24 numbers were declared. Technically, the stock has given a sharp correction below its 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average) of Rs 1,595 on a daily interval which is not a good sign for the stock moving forward.  The rise in volumes with a fall in price suggests a long unwinding into the stock which points towards further correction into the prices.  It is trading below Rs 1,600 levels, we advise traders to remain conscious to the stock and there would be good opportunity to go long on HDFC Bank on lower level. So again wait and watch strategy should be used.  Where is the Nifty headed now? Technically do you think the Nifty is still range bound?  Technically, after making the record high, the Nifty 50 has witnessed a deep correction with a 2 percent slump in a single session, making it the worst one day we have witnessed in the last 19 months.  On a short-term chart, 21,500 should be the make-or-break level for the index. if the Nifty reaches 21,500 in a short term perspective, further sell-off can be seen towards 21,300. As of now, we are a bit conscious on the Nifty particularly.  Do you really see another 1,000 points fall in Bank Nifty?  No, we can see 300-400 points fall, but not 1,000 points fall in the Bank Nifty as of now in one session. We are not bearish on Bank Nifty. Bank Nifty could find support near 45,550 zone.  What is your take on Nifty IT as it has seen big breakout last week?  As of now, we are looking at profit-booking into the market, particularly in banking stocks, so, somewhere traders are now shifting towards the defensive space and IT is one of them.  On technical ground, IT is given a big break out on the chart. So, as I said that traders are shifting towards defensive space, we may see some buying into the IT, most of the frontliner already given a breakout to the chart.  TCS, Wipro, Infosys stocks are somehow seeing a long build-up in the pricing. So, we are bullish on IT from here.

Hence, the Nifty 50 is expected to see more correction and may try to take support at 21,450, the low of current month, as if the said level gets decisively broken on a closing basis, then a further steep fall can't be ruled out, while on the higher, 21,650-21,700 is likely to be the immediate resistance, experts said.  On January 17, the Nifty 50 plummeted 460 points or 2.09 percent, the biggest single day fall since June 2022, to 21,572 and formed bearish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily charts.

The said counter has been rejected six times from the Rs 1,725–1,750 zone (refer to the chart) and is currently placed near Rs 1,537 mark. At present, HDFC Bank has taken timely support, retracing near 0.707 percent of its recent up-move.  Having said that, a long-term bull trendline has been placed near Rs 1,500, which is exactly around the above-mentioned 0.707 percent retracement.  On the indicator front, the weekly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has not made any bearish signals, and the weekly stochastics are taking a breather from their recent 260-point move. Based on the technical setup, one can accumulate the said counter in the range of Rs 1,475–1,540 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,399 and a target of Rs 1,715.    Cochin Shipyard  The said counter has been in a stellar rally since it has been making higher highs and higher lows.

In a conversation with CNBC-TV18, the emerging market equity strategist said he is concerned that such a rally is not seen in Indian markets.  “To maintain the powerful rally the Indian markets have enjoyed it needs sector rotation. We are not getting the rotation. This made me concerned that this rally does not have the legs that a broad-based rally would have,” he said.  Mowat pointed out that the markets may have overextended on the expectations of rate cuts after the Fed’s comments in December. “We are seeing little bit of correction after a powerful rally,&quot; Mowat added.  Commenting on HDFC Bank’s results which disappointed the markets, Mowat said the bank’s negative performance will have an impact on the rest of the financials in India and the sector rotation to financials. Mowat reasoned the recent moves in US and Europe were driven by sector rotation towards financials and the lack of that in India is concerning.  On January 17, HDFC Bank stock fell eight percent which affected the Nifty as the stock has 13 percent weightage in the index. The Nifty Bank also fell four percent, making it the worse performing index of the day.  Meanwhile, banks won’t feel the pressure to cut interest rates as there is a disinflation trend and that will result in a jump in real income, Mowat said. Mowat also added that the dollar is going to strengthen as markets expected too much rate cuts from Fed’s commentary in December and now people are dialing back on the expectations. US Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller said pivot in monetary policy will take more time than expected, which soured the sentiments and will result in the strengthening of the dollar.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sector-rotation-needed-to-maintain-rally-not-seeing-that-in-indian-markets-adrian-mowat-12070221.html

Bank Nifty closed at a one-month low at 46,064, falling nearly 4.28 percent – its largest drop since March 7, 2022. Simultaneously, HDFC Bank saw an 8.2 percent decline, marking its sharpest fall since March 30, 2020.  Other banking stocks also fell. Kotak Mahindra Bank lost 3.8 percent, Axis Bank and IDFC First Bank lost 3.4 percent each, ICICI Bank and Bank of Baroda declined 3 percent each, SBI declined 2.3 percent while IndusInd Bank lost 1.6 percent.  HDFC Bank reported a strong profit of Rs 1,630 crore in the third quarter, maintaining steady quarter-on-quarter margins. Treasury gains were used to set aside Rs 1,200 crore for a contingency provision.  HDFC Bank results  HDFC Bank's deposit growth lags advances, with a modest 1.9 percent increase in Q3 FY24. Management avoids volatile wholesale deposits. In the same quarter, deposits rose by Rs 41,114 crore, compared to advances growth of Rs 1.14 lakh crore. The slowdown is attributed to a 3.4 percent dip in wholesale deposits, while retail deposits stayed robust at around 2.9 percent, constituting 84 percent of total deposits as of December.  Its Q3 FY24 NIM (net interest margin) stood at 3.4 percent, unchanged from Q2 FY24 but significantly lower than the pre-merger 4.1 percent. Despite stable margins, the LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) fell from 121 percent in September to 110 percent by December, indicating the bank utilised excess cash and investments to fund loan growth due to sluggish deposit growth.  &quot;Deposit momentum is much needed but the surge in high-ticket deposits may keep margins under pressure. Thus, managing deposits and margins is the key task for HDFC Bank in the coming quarters. We also believe that the bank may accelerate growth in better-yield unsecured loans to compensate for margins. We will keep a close eye on the margin profile of the bank,&quot; said an InCread Equities report.  Axis Securities noted that HDFC Bank plans to avoid using deposit pricing as a differentiator for growing its liability franchise. To align with the RBI's suggested LDR (loan to deposit ratio) of 75 percent, HDFC Bank aims to sustain a deposit growth rate 300-400 bps higher than credit growth. This strategy aims to restore its LDR to pre-merger levels of 85-87 percent (excluding merger impact, LDR is 89 percent). HDFC Bank sees robust opportunities in both the mortgage and retail non-mortgage segments on the asset side. Given the bank's goal of doubling its book every 4-5 years, maintaining consistently strong deposit accretion is crucial.  &quot;We believe deposit mobilisation will remain an uphill task given tight liquidity and stiff competition. While margin pressures will persist, improvement in NIMs will be largely driven by shifting portfolio mix towards retail lending. Gradually improving cost ratios and benign credit cost given the unabated focus on credit quality will support RoAs (return on assets) as margins face headwinds. NIM recovery remains a key re-rating trigger for HDFC Bank,&quot; Axis Securities said in its latest note.  F&amp;amp;O blues  Call writers dominated, as per options data, showing a significant short position at 47400, 47,800, and 48,000 levels. JM Financial's Soni Patnaik highlighted a mixed bag of positions, with aggressive open interest additions in Bank Nifty 47500 CE. The index broke crucial support at 46800, and Patnaik suggested observing if it can recover above 47500. Failure to do so might lead Bank Nifty down to 46000, with today's low of 46500 expected to act as support going forward.  &quot;The banking index's gap-down opening has weakened the positive bias seen since the beginning of the year. Maintaining firm support at 46282, its 50-SMA, is crucial for sentiment recovery. To establish a robust trend, the index needs to confidently surpass the 48000 level. Conversely, a break below the 50-SMA may signal a bearish bias, potentially leading to levels of 45000,&quot; said Avdhut Bagkar, Derivatives &amp;amp; Technical Analyst at StoxBox.

Parekh continues to like the IT sector because the sector has a projection of 10-12 percent revenue growth CAGR over the next two years.  Parekh is also positive on power, capex, and auto companies. He says the sentiment is positive on these sectors as some of the companies have ancillary entities to help boost their growth. Power sector companies have finance and capital goods, while the auto industry too has ancillary companies as well.  HDFC Bank results  Parekh said that HDFC Bank results were broadly in line with estimates.  Also read: HDFC Bank shares tank 7% after Q3 results disappoint investors  Parekh does not see any major concerns for private banks. &quot;When banks reported their provisional numbers there were hardly any banks which reported a higher deposit growth as compared to loan growth,&quot; said Parekh.

HDFC,2024-01-17T15:41:20+05:30,Jinit Parmar,MC Analysis: Top 5 takeaways from HDFC Bank’s Q3 earnings,"We examine the bank’s profits, provisions, digital initiatives, NPAs,  and the impact of the increase in the risk weight of assets. ","HDFC Bank, on January 16, reported a net profit of Rs 16,372 crore for the October-December quarter of 2023-24, a 33.5 percent jump over the Rs 12,259 crore clocked a year ago. However, the country’s largest private sector bank reported slightly increased pressure on its non-performing assets (NPA), where gross NPA stood at 1.26 percent, from 1.23 percent a year ago.  The bank also made some announcements regarding  its provisions, alternative investment funds (AIF), digital initiatives, and impact of the increase in the risk weight of assets.  Here is an analysis of the five key elements of the earnings report:  Net profit  The 33.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit was slightly lower than the market estimate, which expected a net profit of Rs 16,427 crore - a 34 percent jump. While meeting expectations on headline numbers, the results disappointed investors who looked under the hood.  The disappointment was reflected in the shares of the bank, which fell over five percent on January 17 following a seven percent slump in the bank’s  ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) overnight, post the results.  Asset quality  On NPAs, the lender reported stable quarterly numbers, albeit with a slightly higher GNPA. On the other hand, the net NPA for the quarter stood at 0.31 percent compared to 0.33 percent last year.  In absolute numbers, the bank’s GNPA stood at Rs 31,110 crore, versus Rs 18,763 crore last year, and the NNPA stood at Rs 7,664 crore, versus Rs 5,024 crore in the year prior.  Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, Chief Financial Officer, HDFC Bank, highlighted that the bank had seen an improvement in its asset quality. &quot;Our asset quality has improved and the current credit conditions seem quite good,’’ Srinivasan said in the press conference after announcing the results.  AIF provisions  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on December 19, 2023, said that regulated entities, such as banks, non-bank lenders, and home financiers, cannot invest in AIFs that have directly or indirectly invested in companies that have borrowed money from the lenders.  The central bank said such lenders need to liquidate their investments in the AIF scheme within 30 days if the AIF  makes a downstream investment in any such debtor company.  Further, if lenders are already invested in schemes with such downstream investments, the 30-day period shall be counted from the date of issuance of the circular, the RBI added. If lenders fail to liquidate their investments in that time, they need t make a 100 percent provision on such investments, the RBI noted.  Here, Vaidyanathan said that the bank has made a 100 percent provision for its AIFs. &quot;Our AIF book is Rs 1,220 crore, and RBI asks us to make a provision for that by January 18. We have done so. We have made a contingent provision of 100 percent of our AIF book,&quot; he explained.  Digital investments  For the past few years, many big banks, including HDFC Bank, have been facing issues regarding their technology and digital banking services. Moneycontrol has in the past highlighted these issues.  Regarding new digital initiatives, Vaidyanathan said the bank is working on its net and mobile banking, and expects to bring the revamped platforms to the market in the next two quarters.  “We are developing that internally, instead of getting a third-party and adapting our systems,” Vaidyanathan said.  RWA impact  On November 16, the RBI increased the risk weight on unsecured consumer loans from banks and NBFCs by 25 percent. Earlier, a risk weight of 125 percent was applicable for banks, and 100 percent for NBFCs. The same now stands at 150 percent for banks and 125 percent for NBFCs.  The increase in risk weight for commercial banks (on outstanding as well as new loans) includes personal loans. However, other categories such as housing, education, and vehicle loans, and loans secured against gold and gold jewellery, have been excluded as the risk perception is less on these loans.  Here, Srinivasan said that the bank had a 97 basis points (bps) impact on the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) due to the increase in the risk weight on unsecured loans.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mc-analysis-top-5-takeaways-from-hdfc-banks-q3-earnings-12069501.html
HDFC,2024-01-17T14:09:20+05:30,Broker Research,Buy HDFC Bank; target of Rs 2100: Emkay Global Financial,"Emkay Global Financial is bullish on HDFC Bank has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2100 in its research report dated January 17, 2024.","Emkay Global Financial's research report on HDFC Bank Despite the slower NII growth and contingent provisions (Rs12.2bn) towards AIF investments, HDFCB reported in-line PAT at Rs163.7bn, primarily due to lower tax incidence (write-back of Rs15bn provisions, pursuant to a favorable court order). After sharp fall in 2Q, Bank noted stable NIM at 3.6% (3.4% on assets), which we believe was partly due to absence of the ICRR drag and a better LDR. Though deposit growth was slower in 3Q (+2% QoQ), Bank contends that it would continue to resist bulk deposits unlike other banks, and even mobilize regulatory cost-efficient borrowings in the interim. That said, we believe the Bank needs to accelerate deposit growth, given rising regulatory concerns about higher LDR (+100%) and lower LCR at 110%. This may have some bearing on margins in the near term, but would support structural margin recovery in the long run, as it replaces the high-cost eHDFCL borrowings and thus supports core profitability. On asset quality, Bank remains comfortably placed, while one off-gains from the HDFC Credila stake sale, potentially in 4Q, could help it further shore-up provision buffers.  Outlook We cut FY25-26E earnings by 3%, building-in the growth moderation, but retain our long term BUY with TP of Rs2,100/sh (valuing the core bank at 2.8x Dec-25E ABV + subs at Rs192/sh). That said, all eyes will be on deposit and margin recovery in the near term.

Other than HDFC Bank's disappointing Q3 show, cautious outlook for private banks also hit investor sentiment, leading to sharp selling in the banking pack","Banking stocks saw heavy selling on January 17, as all 12 Nifty Bank index names settled with sharp cuts after negative commentary on heavyweight HDFC Bank's below-par December numbers weighed heavy on sentiment for the sector.  HDFC Bank, which takes up over 29 percent of weightage in Nifty Bank, dived over 8 percent, putting pressure on the sectoral index, which was down 4.3 percent. The weakness also rubbed off on other lenders, pulling them down by up to 4 percent.  Other index heavyweights, IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI and Axis Bank, which have a cumulative weightage of nearly 49 percent in Nifty Bank, lost 2-4 percent.  HDFC's Q3 net profit came largely in-line with Moneycontrol's estimates but there was a twist. Brokerage firm Jefferies noted that the net profit was lifted with a lower tax expense in the third quarter.  Bernstein also highlighted that the lender had to once again use the lower tax expense route to maintain its 2 percent return on assets (RoA).  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  A 50 percent jump in provisions as well as flattish net interest income growth also soured sentiment.  Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer, Axis Securities, said HDFC Bank's results showed heightened levels of credit/deposit (CD) ratio beyond the Reserve Bank of India’s comfort levels.  &quot;This is the case with most other banks as well. Thus, the markets expect either margin pressure, in case banks go in for aggressive deposit mobilisation, a slowdown in lending growth, or both. This development can lead to some de-rating of the sector,&quot; Kulkarni said.  Also Read | Bank Nifty plunges 1,500 points down on HDFC Q3 results; traders watching 46,500 support  Brokerage firm Citi also issued a cautious outlook for private lenders, as it lowered FY25/26 net interest margin estimates for Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Federal Bank and ICICI Bank.  The firm said that quarterly business updates reflected further loan-to-deposit expansion and loan-to-credit contraction, which points towards further downside to net interest margin.  The brokerage downgraded state-lender SBI to “sell” and lowering its price target for the stock by over 14 percent to Rs 600. Citi also initiated a 90-day negative catalyst on SBI.  It also downgraded Federal Bank to “neutral” and reduced the target price by 20.5 percent to Rs 135.

HDFC,2024-01-17T13:27:16+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra,HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie,"Ever since the merger, HDFC Bank's asset book has grown tremendously but deposits haven't. The average quarterly net deposit growth for 9M FY24 stood at Rs 63,600 crore, much lower than the guided Rs 1 lakh crore","In its deepest plunge in three years, the HDFC Bank stock tanked over 6 percent on January 17, in a market disappointed by the flat margins posted by the country's largest private lender for the October-December quarter. But, it is challenging for HDFC Bank to deliver both on margins and costs, Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie told Moneycontrol.  The net interest margins (NIM) of HDFC Bank for Q3FY24 stayed on a par with the previous quarter's 3.4 percent. &quot;Markets are clearly not happy with that kind of outcome, they want margins to improve,&quot; Ganapathy said. In Q3FY23, before HDFC and HDFC Bank had merged, the bank's margins were 4.1 percent.  Follow our market blog for all the market action  &quot;The market needs to understand that margin improvement will be a function of how good your deposit mobilisation is, how you are able to reprice on the assets front, move more towards retail deposits and within that towards higher-yielding retail to drive the margins,&quot; he explained.  Ever since the merger, HDFC Bank's asset book has grown tremendously but deposits haven't. The average quarterly net deposit growth for nine months of FY24 stood at Rs 63,600 crore, much lower than the guided Rs 1 lakh crore.  &quot;Deposit growth for HDFC Bank is good, better than other players, but it does not match up to the needs of the merger. CASA deposits are going down, term deposits are going up, all that is affecting margins. Eventually you have to manage your ALM (asset and liability management) structure well,&quot; Ganapathy said.  Also read: PSUs buck market trend, zoom up to 10%, analysts see valuations still cheap for some stocks  The CASA (current account, savings account) ratio was broadly flat sequentially at 37.7 percent for HDFC Bank in the quarter under review. CASA is a relatively cheap source of funds for banks. The higher the share of CASA in deposits, the lower is the cost of funds.  The management indicated that it aims to sustain a CASA mix of 39-40 percent over the next 18-24 months.  What will it take for the market to re-rate HDFC Bank?  &quot;They have to deliver core PPoP (pre-provision operating profit) growth of 20-25 percent, which should reflect in the overall earnings growth. It is very clear that in the next 12 months, they should have a better margins than what it is today,&quot; Ganapathy said.  At the same time, he highlighted that HDFC Bank has to open more branches and manage costs. &quot;So, ultimately, it's a pretty challenging outcome for them to deliver both on margins and cost, which is what the market wants 12 months down the line,&quot; he said.  Also read: Sensex tanks 1,300 points, Nifty down 1.7%; 5 factors pulling the market down  Ganapathy and his team expect HDFC Bank's margins to be 10 basis points higher than what they are today, one year down the line. He has an Outperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,075.  &quot;A strong PPoP growth is required for the stock to get rated. If we look at the earnings growth for HDFC Bank this year, it has been 0 percent for FY 24 over FY23. Therefore, we'll have to look at how the EPS growth plays out over the course of next couple of years,&quot; he said.  At 1pm on January 17, the HDFC Bank stock was quoting Rs 1,558 on the NSE, down by 7 percent from previous close.

Margin remained flat at 3.4% despite a rise in the CD ratio and deployment of excess liquidity on the balance sheet as LCR declined sharply to 110%. NII thus came in slightly lower than our estimate, but healthy other income (boosted by the treasury gains) led to in-line profitability. GNPA ratio improved 8bp QoQ to 1.3%, while PCR improved to 75%. Fresh slippages moderated to INR70b/1.2% of loans.

Loan growth at 4.9% QoQ was led by CRB, housing and CC. With system liquidity in shortfall and peak LDR at 77.4%, deposit growth should be faster for current loan momentum to sustain, failing which system loan accretion should reduce in FY25/26E, compressing LDRs. Factoring a 15% CAGR for HDFCB, we trim loan growth by 1% in FY25/26E which would impact NIM by 4/5bps. This could be partly offset by lower opex given softer deposit requirement; our core PAT reduces by 2%/4%.  Outlook While falling LDR could pressurize NIM, bank would focus on (1) controlling deposit cost and (2) improving share of CASA and higher yielding retail.

However, core operating performance remained below expectations as NIMs (based on IEA) were stable q-o-q at 3.6% vs. expectation of improvement (~5-10 bps) due to the release of excess liquidity as regulation on ICRR has now been withdrawn. We believe NIMs have bottomed out, but NIM progression would be the key focus area in the near to medium term. Liability-side transition is also important to track as the CD ratio continues to remain elevated compared to the industry and retail deposit growth continues to remain challenging.

For Nifty traders, the sacrosanct levels of 21,800-21,900 is breached.  “Put writing at 21,800-21,900 suggests caution as the market slips below. Watch for a hold at 21,800. A failure may lead to further selling. Recent sessions show long unwinding on Sensex and Nifty, with investors adopting a cautious approach and booking profits daily amid broken key levels. Bank Nifty faces a significant dent as 47,500 support breaks, with a shift to 47,000, which is also under pressure. Profit-booking in the second half becomes a trend.  Despite a 20 percent gain in Sensex and Nifty over the last year, ongoing earnings season prompts investors to secure profits. Midcap and smallcaps hold marginally green, providing market confidence. Expect potential stability in the second half unless the Nifty fails to recover from 21,800, leading to a potential correction to 21,500, according to Rajesh Palviya, SVP – Technical and Derivatives Research, Axis Securities.  Analysts note that markets overlooked challenges and traded higher, despite India's retail inflation reaching a four-month high of 5.69 percent in December. The concerning aspect is the food inflation at 9.53 percent. With inflation on the rise, the RBI is expected to maintain the repo rate and policy stance in the February policy meeting. Additionally, India's industrial growth rate has dropped to an eight-month low of 2.4 percent in November.  &quot;From a technical perspective, Nifty sees a make-or-break support at 21,501 mark, and a close below this would bring more pressure on the index towards 21,150 in the coming week. Volatility would continue with good and bad news. FIIs are turning to net buyers day by day while uncertainty about the timing and speed of Federal Reserve rate cuts. A recovery and close above the 22126 mark would be a hurdle to watch,&quot; Prashant Tapse, an analyst at Mehta Equities, said.

In a press release, the RBI highlighted regulatory concerns regarding certain transactions involving AIFs by regulated entities that have come to its notice and released guidelines for investments in AIFs by the lenders regulated by it.  “These transactions entail substitution of direct loan exposure of REs to borrowers, with indirect exposure through investments in units of AIFs,” the RBI said.  The guidelines, RBI said, have been introduced to address concerns about potential evergreening through this route.  Regulated entities (REs) shall not make investments in any scheme of AIFs that has downstream investments either directly or indirectly in a debtor company of the RE.  The RBI said lenders need to liquidate their investment in the scheme within 30 days if the AIF scheme, in which lenders are already investors, makes a downstream investment in any such debtor company.

RWA impact  The RBI on November 16 increased the risk weight of consumer credit exposure. It raised the risk weight on consumer loans from banks and NBFCs by 25 percent. Earlier, banks attracted a risk weight of 125 percent and NBFCs 100 percent. After the RBI’s latest move, the same will stand at 150 percent for banks and 125 percent for NBFCs.

However, other categories such as housing loans, education loans, vehicle loans, and loans secured by gold and gold jewellery have been excluded as the risk perception is less on these loans.  Here, Srinivasan said that the bank had a 97 basis points (bps) impact on the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) due to the increase in the risk weight assets on unsecured and other loans.  Bank's Q3 performance  HDFC Bank on January 16 reported a net profit of Rs 16,372 crore for the October-December quarter of 2023-24, which marks a 33.5 percent jump from Rs 12,259 crore clocked a year ago.

Stocks like Bajaj Auto, Hero Moto, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever, Varun Beverages among many other largecaps are also trading above pre-COVID valuations, pointed out Kotak analysts","Circa 2024 may be tricky for investing given the conflict between fundamentals (value) and sentiment (price), according to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. &quot;There is very little value in the market across the capitalisation spectrum after the recent run-up in the megacap names, the last bastion of value in the market until recently,&quot; Sanjeev Prasad wrote in a recent report.  In the last two months, Nifty has rallied over 14 percent with heavyweights like Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank surging 16 percent. Prasad and his team believe that the Indian market is richly valued both on a top-down and bottom-up basis.  Also Read: Year in Review: Dalal Street waltzes to lifetime highs as domestic tunes drown out global tumult  The Nifty50 index is trading at one standard deviation above the long-term average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. Stocks like Bajaj Auto, HeroMoto Corp, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever and Varun Beverages among many other largecaps are also trading above pre-COVID valuations, pointed out Kotak analysts.  On the earnings side, the domestic broking firm expects the net profits of the Nifty50 index to grow 18 percent in FY24 and 11 percent in FY25. Auto sector's earnings growth is seen moderating from 107 percent in FY24 to 4 percent in FY25. Similarly, the capital goods sector's earnings is expected to moderate from 36 percent to 25 percent in the same period. Banks, financials, oil and gas segments are also expected to see earnings growth moderate.  Also Read:  Sectoral Scorecard: The winners and losers of 2023’s bull run  &quot;We see limited scope for earnings upgrades in the context of our benign profitability and volume assumptions across sectors,&quot; the report added. That said, the brokerage also sees a scenario where price-value disconnect might be sustained given the inflows from domestic as well as foreign investors in the past few months.  Sectors to avoid  Kotak's 2024 strategy questions the exuberance surrounding various sectors, notably IT services, automobiles and electric utilities.  &quot;In our view, these sectors have the biggest distortion in price-value proposition irrespective of incremental developments. It would appear that investors are taking their cues from incremental developments and events and ignoring the fact that absolute valuations may already be pricing in the positive developments,&quot; the report said.  Also read: IPO rally stays the course with Rs 60,000-cr share sales lined up for new year  Commenting on the IT services sector, Prasad and his team note the market's overemphasis on near-term positives, like expected lower US interest rates, despite potential challenges ahead. The unpredictability of AI's impact on Indian IT services also remains a lingering concern.  When it comes to autos, what's keeping them at bay is the muted volume growth in the industry for the past few years, changes in two-wheeler and four-wheeler sectors on the back of ongoing EV transition and all-time high profitability, especially in the case of 2W and tyre companies.  For electric utilities, Kotak says that there are several anomalies with the underlying narrative of a possible deficit in electricity generation capacity in India over the next few years.  &quot;The electricity generation roadmap is still unclear, the economics of solar electricity generation are not very good currently and India has still not addressed the issue of distribution reforms and unremunerative electricity tariffs in several states,&quot; it said.

HDFC,2023-12-08T15:32:08+05:30,Moneycontrol News,The great awakening: HDFC Bank shows cup and handle pattern breakout after 2 years of consolidation,Analyst suggests buying and accumulating the stock for an upside target of 2100–2300 levels for the medium to short-term time frame.,"Banking major HDFC Bank's shares surged after the RBI's monetary policy rate decision on December 8. HDFC Bank has now formed a clear cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart and has broken out above the 1580 zone (weekly close).  On December 8, HDFC Bank closed at Rs 1,653.35 on the NSE, up Rs 22.90 or 1.40 percent.  According to Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, &quot;After a long time and almost more than two years of consolidation, HDFC Bank formed a cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart and has broken out above the 1580 zone (weekly close).&quot;   Technical chart of HDFC Bank showing cup and hammer breakout pattern | Source: Prabhudas Lilladher  Levels Ahead  &quot;Further ahead, the next major resistance zone is around 1730 levels, which has been acting as a strong hurdle for the last 2 years. The stock has moved past the 50 EMA, which is around 1605, and strong support is maintained near the important 200-period MA at 1430. A decisive weekly close above the 1730 zone shall awaken a giant towards the next higher target of 2100 levels,&quot; added Koothupalakkal.  Recommendation: BUY  With the RSI recovering strongly from the oversold zone, indicating a decent rise to signal a buy, there is much upside potential visible from current levels. With the chart looking good, Koothupalakkal suggests buying and accumulating the stock for an upside target of 2100–2300 levels for the medium to short-term time frame.

HDFC,2023-12-08T14:27:29+05:30,Vaibhavi Ranjan,"Samir Arora extremely bullish on largecap financials, says share prices to pick up in 2024","HDFC Bank remains Samir Arora's all-time favourite, making up 8.9 percent of Helios Capital's total assets under management","Hedge fund manager Samir Arora has an extremely bullish outlook on largecap financial stocks as he expects them to catch-up with their strong business performance on the back of the returning of FII money in the new year.  &quot;We are betting that largecap financials will perform in a big way because the sector is otherwise doing well but those stocks have not gone up in a significant manner,&quot; Arora, founder of Helios Capital, said in an interaction with CNBC-TV18.  The financial sector stocks’ highest weightage in Nifty 50 also positions them favourably for foreign institutional investor (FII) investments. Whenever FIIs decide to pour money into the Indian market, they will still need to invest substantial money into the financial sector despite the scope of the allocations, Arora said.  He remains confident that FII flows will make a strong comeback in India in 2024. If FIIs turn more disappointed from China, their allocations to India can also rise, which will be a major positive for domestic equities.  Other major sectors that have a high weightage in Nifty are IT and consumer goods.  Arora said the IT sector is unlikely to find favour with FIIs in the backdrop of the macro headwinds and global slowdown plaguing the sector. &quot;Consumer goods, on the other hand, look a bit more expensive to investors who are coming in fresh now and hence FIIs would rather go to financials or companies like Reliance,&quot; he added.  Within the financial space, Arora expects heavyweight HDFC Bank to outperform in the next 12-18 months. The stock has been an underperformer, gaining just over a percent this year, so far, sharply lagging the near 9 percent jump in the Nifty Bank index.  HDFC Bank also remains Arora's all-time favourite. He says it higher than any other banking stock. He also feels that there can't be many banking stocks that trade at a premium to HDFC Bank due to its longstanding history and strong performance.  HDFC Bank is also the biggest holding across all funds of Helios Capital, taking up an 8.9 percent weightage of its total assets under management.  The Samir Arora-founded fund house recently released its first monthly factsheet, which shows HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India as its top three picks. The three banks make 18.8 percent of the company's total assets under management (AUM).  Also Read | Samir Arora's hot picks: HDFC Bank, Zomato, KPIT Tech, MCX and what more?

However, analysts at Macquarie in its recent note cautioned that the banking system may witness slowdown in loan growth and see margin pressure in the medium-term.  &quot;We expect growth to moderate in the unsecured and NBFC segment. While retail and SME segment remain key drivers in the medium-term, CASA remains a big challenge for all the banks.

HDFC,2023-12-06T15:05:05+05:30,Nickey Mirchandani,Stars aligning at macro and micro levels for India: Motilal Oswal Financial Services’ Gautam Duggad,"The Indian equity markets are poised for 22,800 levels in the next six months; a pre-election rally is likely in the foreseeable future, says the Head of Research at the brokerage house","Gautam Duggad, Head of Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, sees stars aligning for Indian markets, both at macro and micro levels and expects Nifty around the 22,800 mark in another six months.  In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol, Duggad discussed how the Nifty earnings per share (EPS), if maintained around Rs 1,140 for FY25, would result in a potential target of 22,800 six months ahead, based on the market trading at its long-term average. However, he emphasised that this target is subject to adjustments influenced by political outcomes, market flows, sentiment, and liquidity.  Duggad highlighted the macroeconomic picture, citing India's growth leading at 7.7 percent in the first half and expected to reach 6.5-6.8 percent for FY24. He noted stability in global interest rates reaching their peak and a similar expectation domestically. Crude prices and bond yields, both nationally and internationally, have stabilised.  Additionally, he pointed out impressive earnings growth, with the recent Nifty earnings season showing 28 percent growth against an expected 21 percent. Corporate earnings have surged by 30 percent in the first half, with a revised full-year estimate at a 22 percent growth rate, resulting in attractive valuations for large caps at approximately 18 times.  Furthermore, he said that since September various high-frequency indicators have consistently shown positive trends, such as GST collection, monthly auto sales, power and freight demands, and PMI data for manufacturing and services. The economy maintains momentum supported by robust corporate earnings, and domestic market flows have sustained stability. He concluded that the recent relief from political uncertainty could potentially fuel a pre-election rally in the foreseeable future. Edited excerpts:  Your report suggests that Nifty has given positive returns (9 percent-36 percent) six months into the announcement of general election results (November to May) on five previous such occasions (1999-2019). What can we expect during the 2024 elections?  Yes, we've noted pre-election stock market trends. Over 25 years, pre-election periods from November to May show double-digit returns, with the lowest at 9 percent and the highest hitting 30-35 percent twice. The context varied each time, including recoveries like the 2009 market rebound from the global financial crisis. The recent election results have relieved market uncertainty, particularly concerning state poll outcomes. This performance boost for the current administration in three out of four states strengthens confidence in political stability post-2024 elections. India seems to have multiple favourable factors aligning both at macro and micro levels. It won't be farfetched to say that a lot of stars are aligning for India, whether at the macro level or micro level.  On a macro scale, our economy leads in growth, hitting around 7.7 percent in the first half and likely to reach 6.5-6.8 percent for FY24. Global interest rates seem to have reached their peak, and domestically, it's likely the same. Crude prices are stable within a certain range, and bond yields, both nationally and internationally, have stabilised.  Additionally, on a micro level, there's been remarkable earnings growth. The recent earnings season for Nifty showcased a 28 percent growth compared to the expected 21 percent. Corporate earnings have soared by 30 percent in the first half, and our revised full-year estimate stands at a 22 percent growth rate. This collective positive performance translates to highly attractive valuations for large caps, hovering around 18 times.  Since September, multiple high-frequency indicators — like GST collection, monthly auto sales, power and freight demands, alongside PMI data for manufacturing and services — have demonstrated consistent positive trends. The economy has maintained a decent momentum, with strong corporate earnings. Market flows, especially domestic ones, have remained steady. The recent alleviation of political uncertainty adds to market optimism. This positive shift could potentially extend into a pre-election rally in the foreseeable future.  What kind of uptick in percentage terms can one look at in the run-up to the general elections? What are the risk factors you think can spoil this rally?  Yeah. So I would not hazard a guess on the percentage of upside, because that's always fraught with a lot of risk. So I won't go down that path. All I can say is that people who haven't yet entered the markets and want to enter now, have to enter with a long-term horizon.  You cannot enter for a one-month, three-month kind of play. If you have a three-year, five-year horizon, and you have capital which you can dispense for that period, then obviously, this period looks good enough, because if we compound at 14-15 percent earnings for the next three years, right now we're talking about 18 percent for next two-year CAGR, even if you were to stretch that to say 15 percent for three years, given the fact that we are trading at 18 times, which is a 10 percent discount to long period average 20 times, the possibility of an investor entering now and earning around 14-15 percent in line with the corporate earnings growth is very strong.  What happens is if you look at the last 12-13 years history of India, a lot of events have come and gone. Macro, micro, global, US Fed, crude oil prices, trade wars and a lot of other wars. One thing that the market has always respected is the underlying corporate earnings. 2010 to 2020 when corporate earnings grew at 6.5 percent compounding, Nifty gave you 8.5 percent compounding, right? From 2020 to 2023, corporate earnings compounded at 23 percent. Nifty gave you 27 percent compounding. And this year, we are talking about FY24 so far, 20 percent growth. So let us see where it ends. But it is safe to say that markets will broadly respect corporate earnings in the long term. In the short to medium term, a lot of events will drive it. Sentiments, flows, and liquidity will drive the market in the short to medium term, but eventually, the market will converge on corporate earnings. That's what history teaches us.  As for the risk, the biggest risk is always in the unknown, right? Because if something is known as a risk, the market tends to discount it very fast, we've seen the corrections in the last 10 years. Last durable corrections, there are very few in the last 10 years, but whenever they have happened, they have happened led by factors which were unknown and unpredictable.  You look at 2018, IL&amp;amp;FS came out of the blue. You didn’t know. Covid 2020, a once-in-a-century kind of an event, obviously couldn’t be forecast. In 2013 there was a decent correction, which happened because of the taper tantrum. So the biggest risk is in the unknown factors. So that you can navigate by getting into fundamentally strong stocks with good balance sheets and cash flows. And you do not overpay too much for that growth.  Can we still look to rally in the range of 9-36 percent in November-May witnessed in the previous elections?  Looking at data is like looking at history; it might repeat or not. As equity analysts, our job is to construct a fundamental understanding. Politics will play out as it does, and from what I gather about politics, some uncertainty has diminished. However, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves because circumstances often change unexpectedly. But assuming this current scenario continues, we can forecast two things.  Focusing on the numbers, the Nifty EPS remains around Rs 1,140 for FY25, with minor fluctuations. If the market trades at its long-term average, which spans a decade and stands at 20 times, considering the current 21 times for FY24, with an EPS of Rs 1,000, projecting at 20 times for FY25, we reach a mathematical target of 22,800 six months down the line. This target can be adjusted based on various factors like political outcomes, market flows, sentiment, and liquidity at that juncture.  If we purely focus on fundamental analysis then 22,800 stands as the mathematical target based on our current EPS estimate without any alterations. However, I've consistently used the conditional ‘if’ because that's the nature of the market — nothing is entirely certain, and we must work with probabilities. Remaining flexible is crucial; we need to adapt our estimations as things progress. Earnings can both disappoint and surprise; for instance, the first-half earnings surprised, leading to a 2 percent upgrade. What if the second-half earnings disappoint? There are numerous factors, both positive and negative, that play into these calculations. Being aware of these uncertainties is essential in this landscape.  Let's talk about your midcap ideas, Godrej Properties, Indian Hotels, Angel One, Global Health, Lemon Tree and PNB Housing. Of all, one idea where you are most bullish and why?  Within the large-cap space, I would prefer Titan because that's something which is a proven performer and it's a stock where we've been bullish for more than 10 years now. We see the compounding story unfolding very well. And that's our top/number one preferred consumer discretionary idea in India for more than a decade and we continue with it.  So far as mid-caps are concerned, I think pointing out one idea will be very difficult because mid-caps are always bottom up and it makes sense to have a basket of a couple of ideas, which is why we have spoken about, say, hotels, real estate, and industrials. We put out a very big, large thematic report on capital goods/industrials yesterday, covering 11 new stocks. So Indian Hotel, Lemon Tree, Metro — some of those ideas apart from Godrej and Sobha from the discretionary basket, and from the financial market, I would put my finger on Angel One. Others are mentioned there in our report. Some of them are part of our model portfolio as well. So we are just reiterating them.  What is the rationale and the fundamentals behind picking Angel One at this juncture? The stock has witnessed 8 times jump in 25 months.  We included Angel at around Rs 1,800 two months ago when our preview report was released. Fortunately, the stock has performed remarkably well, surging approximately 50-55 percent from that point. What's most noteworthy is the earnings have pleasantly surprised for the fourth consecutive quarter, leading to upgrades.  The fundamental narrative behind the stock remains exceptionally strong. There's an evident trend of financial savings getting more technologically inclined. Their monthly disclosures on market share, volumes, and new customer additions consistently reinforce our confidence in this narrative. Despite the rally, the stock is still priced at 20-22 times with a high Return on Equity (ROE) and significant dividend payout.  However, it's crucial to acknowledge its high beta nature, typical for a capital market-oriented company. There's a potential downside, especially if the markets correct or sentiments worsen. This stock has already displayed substantial growth over the past three years. We previously had it in our model portfolio when it ranged from almost Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,700. It was reintroduced in October during our 2Q FY24 preview analysis.  Your midcap ideas seem to be divided between hotel and real estate. Help us understand what you see in the real estate sector  Real estate has endured a downward trend for over a decade since 2010. Only recently have we observed improvements, with companies performing well, better execution, and enhanced pre-sales. Following a remarkable FY23, we initially anticipated growth moderation at the outset of FY24, projecting a 14 percent pre-sales increase for our coverage universe.  However, as of December, that estimate has already surged to 31 percent. We recently released a sector note on real estate, detailing the changes in numbers and our perspective on pre-sales and new launches. In the first half, there were approximately Rs 26,000 crore of new launches, and we anticipate the second half to witness Rs 80,000 crore or more for our coverage universe. Crucially, balance sheets have shown improvement as real estate operates based on both balance sheet strength and cash flow.  Additionally, the affordability of properties for end buyers has increased over the last seven to eight years due to decent income growth, while property prices in metros struggled for a significant part of the last decade. We foresee further momentum ahead; we're merely in the second year of an upturn. Hence, our bullish stance on real estate persists, with a couple of highlighted ideas featured in our report.  Since the rally is led by financials, do you think the space looks attractive at the current valuations?  As far as banks are concerned, you have to admire the fact that they've had one of the best last five years in terms of their operational performance. As I keep repeating, the profit pool of financials in Nifty has increased five times in five years, from Rs 45,000 crore in 2018 to Rs 2,20,000 crore in 2023. I mean, talking about that profit pool jumping to Rs 3 lakh crore in FY25. But the market cap hasn't kept pace with that.  You know, if you look at the market cap of the same 11 companies in Nifty, back in FY18, the combined market cap was Rs 21 lakh crore. As we speak, it has not even crossed Rs 40 lakh crore. So, what has happened is some of the big banks have seen de-rating, which essentially means that the risk-reward for large-cap banks has become extremely attractive in our view, whether it is private or PSU. We like both.  But relatively, our preference has been more towards PSU banks for more than a year. We have a huge overweight sitting in our model portfolio on PSU banks. And, of course, we have the usual names in private banks in our portfolio – ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and AU Finance. So, we are very positive overall. It's one of our preferred sectors, given the valuation and attractive risk-reward that exist in the financial space.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stars-aligning-at-macro-and-micro-levels-for-india-motilal-oswal-financial-services-gautam-duggad-11863271.html

Among smallcaps, the fund has less than 1 percent allocation in Mrs Bectors Foods, Landmark Cars, Westlife Foodworld and Solar Industries","No prizes for guessing which stock is Helios Flexi Cap Fund's top holding. HDFC Bank, beyond doubt, Samir Arora's all-time favourite. The fund, which comes from Arora-founded Helios house, has come up with its first monthly factsheet that shows HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India as its top three picks.  The celebrated fund manager made a comeback in India's mutual fund scene last month, but this time as a sponsor, and all eyes are on his hotlist. The three banks make for 18.8 percent of the total assets under management. HDFC Bank alone has a 8.9 percent weight in the AUM, despite the stock's underperformance over the past one year.  Arora acknowledges this underperformance. In an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol, he had promptly dedicated the famous Bollywood song, Kya Hua Tera Vaada, for the stock. However, he believes the stock's underperformance can reverse in the next one year and it can beat the benchmark.    Other holdings  The fund has allocated 3 percent each to Zomato and HPCL.  Arora, who usually stays away from state-run companies, went against his philosophy and bought HPCL in his PMS earlier this year. “I bought it based on one comment from my analyst who said that it was incredibly cheap – the company is quoting at a market capitalisation lower than that of Zomato,” he said.  At Rs 117, Zomato enjoys a market-cap of Rs 1 lakh crore. On the other hand, at the current price of Rs 376, HPCL commands at a market-cap of Rs 53,000 crore.  The Rs 624-crore fund also has more than 2 percent allocation each to KPIT Tech, MCX, Cholamandalam Investment and One97 Communications. KPIT Tech is up 16 percent in the past one month, while MCX has gained 24 percent. Chola has given flat returns and Paytm is down 6 percent.  Also read: Samir Arora returns: How good is the track record of the OG of Indian mutual funds  Indian Hotels, ITC, Lemon Tree also feature on the list. Among smallcaps, the fund has less than 1 percent allocation in Mrs Bectors Foods, Landmark Cars, Westlife Foodworld and Solar Industries.  A user on X pointed out that the fund looks largely similar to other flexi-cap funds and misses Arora ka tadka, to which he replied, &quot;Let us see over time whether it is similar in results.&quot;  Helios fund house investment philosophy  The new fund house follows “elimination investing” philosophy, which will avoid stocks that can underperform on a long-term basis.  Called Elimination Investing, Helios’ unique EI framework involves weeding out the bad as the first step. “It is easier to know what is bad than what is good. Rejecting bad companies increases the chances of arriving at the good companies, reduces errors, and reduces the cost of errors,” as per the fund house.  The fund house looks at various factors for permanent rejection and temporary rejection. Permanent factors include ‘Limited Size of Opportunity’, ‘Unfavourable Industry Dynamics’, ‘Potential for Disruption’, ‘Low Quality of Accounting’, ‘Weakness in Management/Background/Strategy’, ‘Poor Corporate Governance’ and ‘Low Quality Governance’.  Temporary factors include ‘Negative Medium-term Triggers’ and ‘Unreasonably High Valuations’. The team further classifies a company as good and bad on each of these factors.

HDFC,2023-12-05T06:15:57+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Trade Spotlight | Your strategy to deal in Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ABB India today","HDFC Bank has decisively broken its downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of July 3 and September 15, and formed bullish candlestick pattern with lower shadow on the daily scale.","With the market in an upbeat mood after a three-state victory of the BJP and a better-than-expected GDP data for Q2FY24, backed by favourable global cues, consistent funds flow from FIIs and DIIs, and continuation of higher highs, higher lows formation with strong volumes for a week now, experts expect the trend to remain in the favour of bulls which can take the Nifty50 towards 20,900-21,000 levels in coming days with immediate support at 20,600-20,500 levels.  On November 4, the benchmark indices hit a historic high and recorded the biggest single-day gain in more than a year. The Nifty50 jumped 419 points or 2.07 percent to 20,687, and the BSE Sensex rallied 1,384 points or 2.05 percent to 68,865, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent.  Stocks that participated in Monday's bull run included Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, and ABB India. Federal Bank rose 3.6 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 154.05 and formed bullish candlestick pattern with long lower shadow on the daily charts, with above average volumes. The stock traded above all key moving averages (20, 50, 100 and 200-day EMA - exponential moving average), which is a positive sign.  HDFC Bank has decisively broken its downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of July 3 and September 15, and formed bullish candlestick pattern with lower shadow on the daily scale. The stock opened above 200-day EMA and finally got back above all key moving averages. It climbed 3.5 percent to Rs 1,609 with above average volumes.  ABB India has also seen a breakout of falling resistance trendline adjoining highs of September 11 and November 30, and formed strong bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with healthy volumes. The stock jumped 5.6 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 4,630.75 and traded above all key moving averages.  Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Federal Bank  In the previous session, the stock made a fresh new life time high. Prices are trading near the previous swing high, which was near Rs 155.20, as shown in the below chart. This stock may rise further if it closes above it.  The 50-EMA (exponential moving average Rs 146) is acting as a excellent support line that has provided support at regular intervals. This implies that as long as this line is protected, one should be in the direction of the current ongoing trend, and any pullback towards it should be viewed as a buying opportunity. According to this, support is near Rs 146 levels.  In short, overall trend for Federal Bank is positive. A close above Rs 155 is must for further bullish momentum to continue. While on the downside Rs 146 levels can act as a near term support.    HDFC Bank  HDFC Bank has been rising over the past few days. HDFC Bank is following 53-day’s time cycle very well and we can clearly see that prices are forming low every time it approaches near to this cycle. Time Cycle helps to understand if the overall trend is going to reverse back on upside.  As shown in below chart prices are bouncing back every 53 days. Recently prices made a low near our cycle which was near Rs 1,460-1,470. Following that, the stock reversed to the upside and is still in an uptrend.  Prices closed above the previous day's high in the previous session, indicating a positive signal. Furthermore, prices have recently closed above the Ichimoku cloud. So, Time cycle, Indicators, and Price action are all in sync, indicating that the outlook for this stock is positive.  In short, trend for this stock is positive. Use dips as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 1,650 levels as long as Rs 1,560 holds on the downside.    ABB India  ABB has been increasing continuously over the past few days. In the previous session, prices formed a large bullish candle on the daily chart. The price closed at Rs 4,630 levels. Breakout of the Rounding Bottom is still pending.

HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are his top picks","Bulls pushed Nifty Bank index to fresh record highs on December 4 amid a rally fuelled by BJP's state election wins. The banking index surged over 1,600 points or 3 percent to hit a fresh high of 46,484, clocking its biggest single-day gain since April 2022. It settled at 46,431. The sharp rally has pushed Bank Nifty's year-to-date gains to 7 percent, trimming its underperformance vis-a-vis NSE Nifty50.  Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies LLP believes that the banking sector is set for recovery.  Bank Nifty index fell to 42,280 on October 26. Since then, the index has bounced back 4,000 points. HDFC Bank has been the biggest contributor to the Nifty Bank's recovery, contributing over 900 points, or 7 percent to this rally. ICICI Bank also rose 7 percent during this period.  Going forward, a rise in foreign investor inflows, a decline in US bond yields, and the optimistic anticipation of no further rate hikes will fuel gains for Indian equities.

Andrew Holland's top bets  Within the sector, Andrew Holland prefers private sector lenders more than PSU banks as the management of public sector banks keeps changing every three years. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are Holland's top picks among the private sector banks.  Banks have attractive valuations and are backed with clean and healthy balance sheets, strong asset quality, and are witnessing robust credit growth, according to analysts.

Here's why,"The company also said that they have been closely monitoring the Stage-2 rural B2C segment and taking corrective actions, which has resulted in moderate growth in this segment.","Much ahead of Reserve Bank of India's directive on increased risk weights on consumer loans, Saurabh Mukherjea and his team at Marcellus Investment Managers had trimmed their stake in Bajaj Finance. He switched this to increased allocation towards HDFC Bank.  &quot;The management had flagged concerns in the B2C portfolio in their Q2 earnings concall in October. When Bajaj Finance flags off something like this, the industry must pay attention. We had trimmed our position in the stock, right after that,&quot; Mukherjea said in a conversation with Moneycontrol.  Also Read: BJP sweep powers Nifty to another high, Sensex gains 1,000 points to climb new peak  The non-banking financial corporation's management had said that risk metrics remained green except B2C, which was yellow as of September 2023. The company also said that they have been closely monitoring the Stage-2 rural B2C segment and taking corrective actions, which has resulted in moderate growth in this segment.  &quot;When we (my team and I) were travelling across the country, we realised that small, unsecured loans of Rs 20,000 - Rs 30,000 ticket sizes were growing 25-30 percent. Over 90 percent of mobile phones are being bought with credit, that too by low income consumers. This was worrying for us. So, we took heart from Bajaj, HDFC Bank and Chola Finance when they said they were cutting back on this segment,&quot; Mukherjea said.

While most analysts termed it as a double whammy for Bajaj Finance, coming just days after a product ban, Mukherjea does not see this as a big worry.  &quot;Bajaj Finance has a big book for housing finance too, on which risk weight has not been increased. Moreover, it borrows more from bonds than banks so the quantum by which cost of funds will go up is not as high as other NBFCs,&quot; he said, adding that cost of funds can go up by 20-30 basis points.  As of September 2023, Bajaj Finance borrowed 32 percent from bank loans and 33 percent from non-convertible debentures.  When it comes to unsecured consumer loans, Mukherjea believes fintech will soon see their day of reckoning. &quot;Fintechs have aggressively disbursed unsecured loans and they do not have the wherewithal to collect that back. While they (fintechs) do it in partnership with listed banks, it only makes for a small amount of the bank's large book,&quot; he said.

The impact of these regulations is likely to be limited. We estimate just about 55-90 basis points (bps) impact on their CET-1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR),” said Dnyanada Vaidya, Senior Research Analyst – Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), Axis Securities.  ALSO READ: Decoding RBI credit risk weight impact across banks, NBFCs; how each lender will lose, gain  HDFC Bank’s CAR stood at 17 percent, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s CAR stood at 21 percent, suggested data. Both banks’ capital was at healthy levels as per the RBI mandate, which requires private sector lenders to maintain at least 8 percent of CAR levels with the central bank.  On November 17, the RBI revised its risk weight for unsecured consumer loans, encompassing personal loans and credit card loans. Consumer credit, excluding housing, education, vehicle, and jewellery loans, will now attract 125 percent risk-weight assets (RWA). On the other hand, credit cards for banks will see an increase in RWA to 150 percent from 125 percent earlier.  On the overall banking system, VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said that lenders would be able to easily pass on the increased cost to borrowers, without seeing any major drag on their profit pool.  Where do HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank stand against peers?  According to a Jefferies report, HDFC Bank’s exposure to personal loans stood at 8 percent of its total loan book as compared to ICICI Bank’s 9 percent, IDFC First Bank's 19 percent, and State Bank of India's (SBI) 10 percent. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s exposure to personal loans, on the other hand, was the lowest at 5 percent.  ALSO READ: RBI's new lending norms: Banks to absorb higher risk weight as unsecured retail credit low, says Moody's  On the credit card loan front, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank were at 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Other lenders like ICICI Bank's credit card loan exposure stood at 4 percent, IDFC First Bank at 1 percent, and Axis Bank at 4 percent.  That apart, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank's estimated loans to NBFCs were at 1 percent and 5 percent, respectively. Compared to other lenders, estimated loans to NBFCs for IDFC First Bank was at 3 percent, ICICI Bank at 7 percent, SBI at 8 percent, and Canara Bank at 11 percent.  According to Jefferies report, IDFC First Bank and ICICI Bank may require additional capital consumption of 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, whereas Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank's additional capital consumption would be 0.6 percent post the RBI's new risk-weight norms.    &amp;nbsp;  Finally, the revised tier-1 CAR suggested ICICI Bank will take hit of about 74 bps and IDFC First Bank would take a hit of 80 bps, the Jefferies note added. Meanwhile, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank would see a hit of up to 60 bps.    What should investors do?  Following the RBI’s tightening over unsecured retail lending, shares of HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank remained flat in the past two trading sessions. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and IDFC First Bank, however, declined up to 4 percent during the same period.  Kaitav Shah, lead BFSI analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities, believes that this knee-jerk reaction across banking names is only temporary in nature and investor sentiment is likely to improve over the medium term.  “We maintain a ‘buy’ call on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of Rs 2,095 in the next one year. For HDFC Bank, we call a ‘hold’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,698 per share,” Shah added.  Valuation-wise, HDFC Bank was trading at an attractive 20 times (x) price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, lower than sector’s PE mean of 24x. Kotak Mahindra Bank, too, was inexpensive at a 20x PE ratio.

HDFC,2023-11-18T07:03:31+05:30,Dhananjay Sinha,Will the rally in small PSU bank shares sustain?,"Expert expects to see derating in smaller PSBs as the surge in other income, the primary driver of superior RoE (return on equity) in FY23 could be transient.","The heavyweight Bank Nifty index has been languishing since the last two years, inching up merely 3 percent. But, among its constituents, stock prices of large banks and small public sector lenders have shown contrasting performance. To gauge if the outperformance of smaller PSBs versus large banks (PSBs and PVBs - private banks) can sustain, we looked at measures such as returns, operating performance, credit cycle, NPA movement, and provisioning trajectory.  In conclusion, we expect to see derating in smaller PSBs as the surge in other income, the primary driver of superior RoE (return on equity) in FY23 could be transient, while larger banks with better ALM (asset and liability management) positions and underwriting capabilities would outperform.  A peek into the business performance: One, business market shares (deposits + advances) of smaller PSBs declined in FY23 relative to both SBI and larger PVBs, but recovery of written-off loans drove up return ratios of PSBs. Two, large private banks sustained gains in business share (advances &amp;amp; deposits), credit cycle, and better underwriting track record in FY23. RoEs of PSBs rose significantly in FY23 (12 percentage points (pp) and 16.5pp for SBI &amp;amp; BoB, respectively) compared to those of PVBs (ICICI Bank up 4.7pp, HDFC Bank 0.08pp, Axis Bank -0.97pp and Kotak Mahindra Bank 1.38pp).  Also read: Opportunity in market correction: MFs added these new midcaps in Oct  Markets seem to have reacted differently: Shares of smaller PSBs nearly doubled and valuations surged by 50-60 percent, especially in the last 8-12 months. Amongst all PSBs, Bank of Baroda’s valuations benefitted the most from declining NPAs (correlation coefficient: -0.91). For instance, its business market share/total PSU share fell from 12.52 in FY20 to 10.26 in FY23, but P/B (price-to-book) more than doubled from 0.5x in December 2021 to peak level of 1.1 in December 2022.  Conversely, valuations of PVBs moderated during this period, even though PVBs (increased 0.6pp) scored over PSBs (average of 0.40pp) on NIMs, reflecting relatively better credit cycle. Major banks (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Axis Bank) saw de-rating during this period, in contrast to the re-rating seen in smaller PSU banks (PSBs). For instance, largecap like State Bank of India (SBI) underperformed and remained stagnant since October 2021; its P/B de-rated from a peak of 1.8x in November 2021 (trailing) to 1.5x currently. Likewise, large private banks too saw muted valuations.  Also read: Bajaj Finance in double trouble from RBI’s risk-weight norms, product ban  Will the dichotomy sustain? We gather, the valuation differential for smaller PSBs does not appear to be guided by fundamentals of business cycle and market power hypothesis. Rather, the rerating of smaller PSBs appears to be guided by RoE gains. The recovery from written-off loans classified under advance under collection account (AUCA; attributed to the past NPA cycle) was substantial for smaller PSBs in FY23 at 100-200 percent YoY, which contributed disproportionately to its net profits and hence, these banks delivered superior RoEs, notwithstanding their modest NIMs and pre-provisioning profits.  Given that these are legacy factors, they are expected to decline going forward. Small PSBs have risen to peak levels recently but the recent sell offs in small PSU banks appear to be blunting the re-rating momentum in the space in last 8-12 months.  Also read: UBS says India ‘least attractive’, analysts warn of election and oil price risks  Smaller PSBs at peak valuations: Based on our study, we gather, holding pattern of PSBs (dominated by concentrated bets by certain FIIs) and fundamental factors such as recovery of written-off loans have caused return ratios and valuations of smaller PSBs to shore up. Further, a quarterly series of stock ownership, NPA ratios, yields on advanced, and cost of deposits indicate low contemporaneous correlation between valuations and spreads variables (yields, cost of deposits). There exists an inverse correlation between GNPA (gross non-performing assets) ratios and valuations, especially for Indian Bank (-0.82) and BoB (-0.91); SBI is at -0.54, but for other PSBs, it is less consistent.  Changes in shareholding patterns appear to have influenced the valuations of smaller PSBs. We envisage valuations of smaller PSBs could derate from the current level, as surge in other income, the primary driver of superior RoE for smaller PSBs could be transient, given that it comes from recovery of written-off bad loans. For SBI, it peaked out in FY21 and was down 25 percent in FY23 at Rs 7,692 crore.  Also read: Ola Electric converts to public company ahead of IPO filing  Larger banks may outperform: Evolving cyclical factors like sustained tightness in global rates, FII outflows, rising yield curve translating in trading losses, continued pressure on NIMs, and bottoming out of the NPA cycle would determine the performance of lenders, including banks and NBFCs. In this context, we believe larger banks with better ALM positions and underwriting capabilities will outperform. Overall, we maintain our underweight position for the BFSI sector.

The central bank has raised credit risk weights on unsecured consumer loans by increasing the capital requirements for such loans as concerns have been growing over these borrowings.

The Reserve Bank of India said the consumer credit exposure for banks and NBFCs, excluding housing, education, vehicle, and gold-backed loans, will attract a risk-weight of 125 percent from 100 percent earlier.  The risk-weight for credit card loans by banks was raised to 150 percent from 125 percent. Those by NBFCs will see a risk-weight of 125 percent, up from 100 percent.  A higher risk implies the bank will have to set aside a higher amount as loan provisioning, which will impact capital ratios of lenders and compel them to increase interest rates on such products to curb impact on return of equity (RoE).  Provision refers to the amount banks need to set aside to cover the losses from a loan account. When an account turns into an NPA, the provisions required will equal the full loan amount.

Sharma commented that the big banks are at a size where they need to take more risks to grow. “The Non-Performing Asset (NPA) number of HDFC Bank came out a while ago and we know what kind of reaction that elicited,” Sharma added.  HDFC Bank in its Q2 results, saw its GNPA/NNPA ratios increase marginally to 1.3 percent/0.4 percent due to its merger with HDFC.  Sharma pointed out that banks don’t want to lend to corporates making retail segments, the prime target. “Nobody wants to lend to the corporates. None of the private sector banks are interested in that. Everyone is chasing the retail loan segment. In that, the bankable retail loan is probably done and dusted. So you need to go to unbankable or moderately bankable which is the unsecured part and this has become a larger pie of incremental bank lending.”  Watch the full interview here  Unsecured loans refer to credit cards, personal and microfinance loans. UBS Group had recently flagged the increasing risks in retail unsecured loans for banks. UBS analysts said that unsecured retail loans increase default risk for banks by 50-200 bps. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently raised concerns about a surge in unsecured credit growth and asked banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) to enhance their internal surveillance mechanisms.  Sharma said this risk-taking approach makes him uncomfortable as blowups have happened across banks worldwide due to unsecured lending. “We will be no exception. Mark my words. In 2 or 3 years, these same loans will come back to haunt these banks. I will be then around hopefully to pick these banks when the trade is closer to book value,” Sharma added.  Also read: Positive on power stocks but not on public-sector as a whole, says S Naren  Sharma said despite being a fan of the Bajaj Group as they managed an unsecured loan book for a long period, he still has scepticism about how they handle the risk now. “I’ve considered them to be fantastic business people. They are very capital efficient and focused on the bottom line and generating cash flow. That said, when you reach a certain size, you will go off the risk spectrum. Earlier, Bajaj Finance could grow, because the pool of lendable assets was there. Maybe now they are getting close to the ceiling of that. We'll see. I hope they defy my scepticism.” Sharma said.  However, it seems like banks are unfazed by their growing unsecured loans. The largest public bank in India, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Khara said they are not concerned with their unsecured loans during their September quarterly result announcement.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/banks-going-into-unbankable-segments-with-unsecured-credit-will-blow-up-shankar-sharma-11709321.html
HDFC,2023-11-08T15:05:33+05:30,Lovisha Darad,HDFC Bank falls out of analysts' favour as merger math spoils margin outlook,"The sharp correction, analysts said, was first majorly due to uncertainty around the merger and later due to merger math being weaker than initial estimates","The Street has turned cautious on shares of HDFC Bank after the lender’s July-September quarter (Q2FY24) scorecard revealed margin concerns post-merger with erstwhile HDFC and fall in earnings per share (EPS) growth for the period.  As per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for October, analysts did not share maximum optimism with the India’s largest private sector lender. HDFC Bank used to consistently feature among Street’s top 10 favourite picks in the previous months (see table).    Other lenders like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, and State Bank of India, however, continued to dominate analysts’ mind in October.  So, why are analysts growing conservative over HDFC Bank?  Bleak margin outlook  Nuvama Institutional Equities, for instance, believes that there is near-term uncertainty on the banks’ margin trajectory and their ability to deliver consistent deposit growth every quarter.  ALSO READ: Analyst Call Tracker: Festive cheer eludes IT biggies, pharma; ICICI Bank emerges Street favourite  In Q2FY24, HDFC Bank’s net interest margins (NIMs) contracted to 3.4 percent due to merger management and regulatory impact caused by incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR), which was 5-10 bps for the quarter.  The regulation on ICRR has now been withdrawn, which analysts believe should result in reversing trend from Q3FY24. However, the normalisation of NIM at 3.65 percent is unlikely in the next one or two quarters and may take longer due to high cost of erstwhile HDFC borrowings and loan-to-deposit ratio.  Thus, given margin pressures and lower benefit of cost ratios, analysts at Axis Securities trimmed earnings estimates for HDFC Bank by 2-5 percent over FY24-26E.  Asset quality impacted slightly post amalgamation  HDFC Bank’s gross non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and net NPL ratio saw sequential increase of 10 bps and 20 bps, respectively in the September-ended quarter. This was mainly on account of some slippages in the non-individual loan book from erstwhile HDFC.  The NPLs of combined HDFC and HDFC Bank was Rs 12,500 crore in Q2FY24, higher than Rs 8,950 crore in the year-ago period.  However, the bank has maintained a healthy provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) at 74 percent that would provide comfort in the long-term.  ALSO READ: Analyst Call Tracker: Strong Q2 performance by RIL leads analysts to upgrade outlook  PCR is the percentage of funds that a bank sets aside for losses due to bad debts. A high PCR can prove to be beneficial to banks to buffer themselves against losses if NPAs start to increase at a faster rate. As per RBI guidelines, PCR above 70 percent is considered to be healthy.  The double fall of stock price and EPS  The EPS growth of HDFC Bank fell significantly to 10.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) in Q2FY24 as compared to 20 percent growth seen in the previous quarter.  This fall in EPS growth was reflective on bourses as well. The stock of HDFC Bank slipped 9 percent in three months as against 2 percent drop in the Bank Nifty index.  The sharp correction, analysts said, was first majorly due to uncertainty around the merger and later due to merger math being weaker than initial estimates.  Way forward  That said, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities assume the worst of merger-related news flow would be worked through and the bank may be able to grow with fewer concerns hereon. They expect HDFC Bank’s balance sheet to grow at a marginally faster rate than industry average.  “We maintain ‘buy’ rating for HDFC Bank with target price of Rs 1,800 per share. At our target price, we value the bank 2.6 times (x) book and 17x 2025E EPS for return of equities (ROEs) at 16 percent levels and 15 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR),” the brokerage firm added.  Those at Nuvama believe that a gradual re-rating for HDFC Bank would depend on how consistent the bank is delivering loan and deposit growth. The management is confident of delivering strong and granular loan and deposit growth.  Meanwhile, analysts at Motilal Oswal said that the bank posed a good beginning post-merger but still has a long way to go. “We estimate HDFC Bank to deliver a CAGR of 18/20 percent in loans/deposits and 21 percent CAGR in earnings over FY24-26, translating into RoA/RoE of 2/17.4 percent by FY26E,” they wrote in a post-result review note.

HDFC,2023-11-08T09:39:28+05:30,N Mahalakshmi,"Quality banks will grow, but can’t reclaim high valuations of the past, says S Naren","Banks are much larger than they were 10 years ago, it is hard to justify the high price-to-book multiple they enjoyed in the past, Naren said.","With the non-performing assets wiped out from banks’ balancesheets and the economy looking up, most investors expect bank stocks to be front-runners in the continuing bull run, but which banks could lead the race?  Celebrated fund manager and chief investment officer of ICICI Prudential AMC S Naren feels that there is need to be very selective with banks, be it private or public sector.  Even as some of the ICICI Prudential's leading equity funds are overweight on quality banks like HDFC Bank, Naren told Moneycontrol that quality banks will not be able to reclaim the high valuations they enjoyed earlier as their large base will not allow them to maintain the growth rates of the past without taking on additional risk.  Private sector banking stocks have been underperforming for a year now. HDFC Bank is down 1 percent, Kotak Mahindra Bank is down 7 percent, ICICI Bank is up 4 percent, while Nifty 50 is up 6.8 percent in the year gone by.  Also Read: Why ace investor Shankar Sharma doesn’t invest in large cap stocks: 'Size ceiling limits growth'  “I doubt whether they (quality banks) can go back to the valuations that they were enjoying 10 years ago, simply because many of them are much larger today.” As these banks are much larger than they were 10 years ago, it is hard to justify the high price-to-book multiple they enjoyed in the past, Naren said.  “When you're small, you can have very high price-to-book because they can they can grow at very high pace. Some of these banks were growing at 30-40 percent. It would be almost impossible to do that kind of growth going ahead.” said Naren.  He said quality banks are firmly on a secular growth story in India, which makes a case for investing in them. However, their valuations of the past may not serve as good benchmark. “Can their price to book keep going up? The answer is no. That's the challenge in some of the private banks which have now become very big.” Naren added.  Watch S Naren's full interview on Samvat 2080  As for public-sector banks, he said, across-the-board stocks have seen significant re-rating and are thus expensive. Public-sector banks will have to be evaluated individually for whether they will continue to maintain their asset-quality or fall prey to bad assets yet again.  So again, time to be selective because “There was a superb way in which they brought down their non performing loans. Due to that, they got rerated. From here, you have to look at them individually and see what happens to their net interest margin, and can they continue to maintain the very low level of non-performing loans. Some banks that declared results recently have been able to manage with almost no provisioning because the book is so pristine. Can it remain like this way, even in private sector, it won't,” said Naren.  Picking stocks when they are very cheap is easier, however, in the current markets as stocks have been re-rated substantially, it poses a challenge, he concluded.  Nifty PSU Bank index has advanced over 36 percent in the year gone by, with constituents like Bank of Baroda up 15 percent, Bank of India up 35 percent, and Canara Bank up 24 percent.

In a conversation with CNBC-TV18, Shah explained that large cap IT companies are only going to grow in low single digits going forward unless they reinvent and “encashes on AI”.  Shah specified companies like MapmyIndia that announced a revenue growth of nearly 20 percent YoY and margins expanding to 45 percent in the September quarter which has lots of use cases in many sectors as a company with long term potential. “Look at the use cases they have, it could be ubiquitous. Any sector that you would be dealing with on a daily basis, you would be touching MapmyIndia directly, Shah said.  Speaking about global view on India, Shah said that global investors are waiting to deploy capital in India post the elections when they get more certainty. “It’s going to be wait and watch in the next few months. Price of crude oil is the biggest variable they are looking at. The West Asia situation is the next and the third is our own set of elections happening”, he added. “Post the election outcome,  we have a higher certainty that we are going to see kind of inflows into India which we have not seen in the past that's the kind of money waiting in the wings out there”, Shah said.  Throwing light on HDFC Bank’s recent struggles, Shah pointed out that the Bank is struggling in relative terms of performance and it could perform when the liquidity comes in. “Three years back, it was the only bank which was delivering consistent performance. The rest was still struggling with repair, they were struggling with their asset quality. Today there are lot more banks, NBFCs, specialised lenders who are delivering more growth. They are delivering 20-25 percent growth, increasing RoE and maintaining their asset quality. So HDFC Bank will continue to underperform” Shah said.

For consumer discretionary, his reasoning lies in per capita income rising above $2,000 and, for industrials, it is government policies","Veteran value investor and ex-CIO of HDFC AMC Prashant Jain continues to make contrarian bets, the portfolio of his alternative investment fund 3P Investment Managers reveals. Moneycontrol accessed 3P India Equity Fund's September factsheet to find Jain still betting on NTPC, REC and Coal India.  The fund size is about Rs 5,800 crore with 3.1 percent weightage in NTPC, 3 percent in REC and 0.5 percent in Coal India. Energy and utilities, sectors where Jain sees a steady growth and attractive valuations, make for 13.4 percent of the fund weightage.  Consumer discretionary and industrials/capex are the two sectors Jain's fund is overweight on. For consumer discretionary, his reasoning lies in per capita income rising above $2,000 and, for industrials, it is the supportive government policies.  &quot;The medium to long-term growth outlook of the Indian economy is extremely strong. Everyone is very positive on the India story,&quot; Jain said in a recent interview to Moneycontrol.  Watch: Have value stocks gone overboard right now? | Prashant Jain of 3P Investment Managers answers  Jain's top bets in these sectors include Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra (3 percent), Maruti Suzuki (2 percent), Zomato (2 percent), IndiGo (1.8 percent), Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (3.7 percent), 3M India (1.5 percent) and Kalpataru Projects (1.1 percent).  Jain has also assigned small weightages to Landmark Cars, Wonderla Holidays, Senco Gold, Anup Engineering, RR Kable, Dynamatic Technologies and Centum Electronics.    Betting on biggies  When it comes to banks, Jain, too, is bullish on the biggest of them all — HDFC Bank. The fund has a 9.3 percent weight assigned to the stock.  Jain expects the bank to continue gaining market share though at a somewhat slower pace due to increased competition, but he believes valuations remain reasonable.  Regarding the management changes and the recent merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank, Jain said, &quot;Management change is inevitable in all companies, and mergers can have a significant impact on near-term results. However, it is well understood by the markets now, and there are several long-term positives in that merger.&quot;    Jain's portfolio also has 8.2 percent weight in ICICI Bank and 7.5 percent in State Bank of India.  Jain is also betting big on his ex-workplace HDFC AMC, with a 2.6 percent weightage. Low penetration of financial products, good growth prospects and reasonable valuations make him bullish on the space. The fund also has an exposure to SBI Life, with 1.3 percent weightage.  In healthcare, the fund is equalweight to the index, with bets in Cipla, Sun Pharma, IPCA Laboratories and Aurobindo Pharma. &quot;These are good businesses and 10-year underperformance relative to Nifty makes it a ripe time for stock picking,&quot; Jain said.  Among miscellaneous bets, the 3P India Equity Fund has 0.4 percent allocation to Time Technoplast and 0.1 percent to Vardhaman Textiles.

HDFC,2023-10-20T10:09:18+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,"Q2 Earnings Review: The bigger they are, the harder they stall?","The Q2 report cards of India’s biggest IT firm, biggest private bank and largest NBFC have a clear message for investors – size can be a double-edged sword.","One of the most crucial campaigns of Alexander the Great was the Battle of Hydaspes in 326 BC, when he went up against King Porus of Punjab. Porus’s mighty army relied heavily on its contingent of war elephants, which struck fear into the hearts of his enemies. However, on the day of the battle, the Macedonian phalanx managed to repulse the giant beasts, which turned around in panic and trampled many of their own soldiers to death.  The episode has played out multiple times in Indian history, and not just in warfare. Size might be a critical advantage in many situations, but it also risks being the biggest drag when the winds turn unfavourable.  Take the current Q2 earnings season, for example.  The country’s biggest IT firm TCS, biggest private sector lender HDFC Bank and largest NBFC Bajaj Finance have for long been benchmarks for Corporate India.  But as their Q2 report card shows, a larger surface area has not only amplified the impact of global and domestic headwinds, but also added to the biggest burden facing any company - the weight of expectations.  Tech Turbulence  TCS kicked off the Q2 results season with a contraction in USD revenues for the first time since the pandemic-hit June 2020 quarter as well as the highest-ever quarterly decline in headcount.  The IT major bore the brunt of the growth pangs in the US and EU, which account for around 68 percent of its topline.    Elevated interest rates and weak consumer sentiment in Western economies have led to a continued slowdown in discretionary spends, leading to delays in decision-making as well as deal conversions.  TCS, Infy, Wipro stocks in red since Q2 results; should you buy IT shares?  “Management highlighted that while the company is able to sign large deals and the new projects are ramping up on time, revenue leakage from existing projects due to deferrals or ramp downs is impacting revenue growth. Furthermore, management highlighted that the demand sentiment has not changed and clients remain cautious,” analysts at Jefferies said.  The silver lining was that deal wins remained strong at $11.2 billion, its second-highest-ever deal total contract value (TCV) and also the third consecutive quarter of deal wins staying above $10 billion - a milestone for India’s $245-billion Indian IT industry.  However, Q2 deal wins were driven by two mega deals with TCV of around $1 billion each from BSNL and JLR. Worryingly, order wins across the key market of North America slumped 13.5 percent QoQ to $4.5 billion.  Needless to say, the Street has taken note of this slowing juggernaut. TCS is the worst performer among the top 3 IT firms for the past month.    Growth Pangs  Probably the most vivid demonstration of ‘big is not always better’ philosophy right now is HDFC Bank, which reported its first quarterly results after it merged with the parent Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC).  While the Q2 numbers are not comparable to the pre-merger period, HDFC Bank’s management had provided proforma numbers for the first quarter to give a sense of how the merged entity would look.  As per an analysis by Jefferies, adjusted for the merger, HDFC Bank’s net profit declined by 2 percent sequentially against the reported 33 percent jump.  The biggest impact was on the net interest margin (NIM), which tumbled by a whopping 70 basis points sequentially to 3.4 percent, as against the 4 percent-level HDFC Bank has traditionally maintained.  HDFC Bank Q2 earnings growth: Is it 50, 10 or 6%? Here is the correct version  NIM - the difference between what banks offer depositors and what they charge for loans – is a key profitability metric for lenders.  One of the major reasons for the deteriorating margins was an increase in liquidity post the merger. When HDFC Bank absorbed HDFC’s loans, it had to increase its liquidity position to meet various regulatory guidelines like cash reserve ratio.  The bank said there was a “debt-funded cost for the additional liquidity and merger management” which was a drag on the NIMs during Q2.  “While we expect NIMs to see sequential improvement going ahead, as the impact of excess liquidity wanes out, it will be difficult to see pre-merger levels as lower-margin home loans of HDFC Ltd gets added to the loan portfolio,” domestic brokerage firm JM Financial said.  Another fallout of the merger was an uptick in its gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio to 1.34 percent from 1.17 percent in Q1 as about Rs 5,000 crore worth of HDFC’s loans were restructured and had to be labelled non-performing on the bank’s balance sheet.  The HDFC Bank stock has been a conspicuous underperformer ever since the merger was announced in April last year, dropping around 7 percent.  Investors, however, can still take heart from the fact that despite its merger-related pain, the analyst view on the company remains overwhelmingly positive.  Hamara Bajaj  Shrinking margins has claimed another high-profile victim this earnings season – Bajaj Finance.  Its net interest income growth of 30 percent lagged AUM expansion of 33 percent due to an 11 bps QoQ compression in NIMs to 10.5 percent.  “Moreover, management guided that margins may see another 25-30 bps compression as funding costs will rise and Bajaj Finance may not like to pass that on to clients. While this will be a drag on top line, Bajaj Finance has levers to slow opex growth… to mitigate impact on profit / ROA,” Jefferies added.  Bajaj Finance: Strong earnings growth, but sustainability is debatable  Other analysts pointed out that its NPA profile will be keenly tracked as it is already one of the most aggressive lenders in the NBFC space today and will have to maintain its scorching pace of growth to sustain its leadership position in the market.  However, as most finance sector professionals know only too well, lending is the easiest part for banks and NBFCs in India. The real challenge is to recover those loans.  Shareholders would be hoping this mad rush for growth does not result in laxity in the company’s credit appraisal process and subsequent deterioration in its asset quality.  Some parts of its book have started throwing up signs of stress.  Bajaj Finance’s gross stage-3 assets (or loans which have been overdue for more than 90 days) increased 5 bps QoQ to 0.9 percent, while the net stage- 3 was largely stable at 0.3 percent.  “Rural B2C exhibited minor stress, and the management has cut incremental business volumes in this segment to mitigate risk. It expects Rural B2C to remain muted until Feb’24 and recover subsequently,” Motilal Oswal said in a note.  Weighed by these lingering concerns, the Bajaj Finance counter closed in the red for two straight sessions after its results announcement.  In a report earlier this year, Elara Securities had described Bajaj Finance as an “elephant that continues to dance”.

HDFC,2023-10-18T08:39:06+05:30,Santosh Nair,Short Call: Unusual bets fetch big bucks; HDFC Bank vs ICICI Bank; and ticking derivatives time bomb,Unknown traders and investors are making more money with unconventional bets than some of the seasoned players who are sticking to the tried-and-tested themes,"“You never get a bubble until the public, the brokerage community, the financial institutions, the pension funds, and even the universities are all involved.” - Arnold Van Den Berg  Afghanistan beat England, Nederlands beat South Africa. It is the season of upsets in the cricket World Cup.  And, something similar is playing out in the stock market, too, pointed out an investor in smallcap and midcap stocks. Unknown traders and investors are making more money with unconventional bets than some of the seasoned players who are sticking to the tried-and-tested themes. Also, stocks of lesser-known companies are being chased by fund houses and HNIs, much to the consternation of the managements of many large companies.  Karur Vysya Bank  The stock made a fresh 52-week high on Wednesday, after reporting record profits for the September quarter. MD and CEO Ramesh Babu said that there    was pressure on net interest margins as cost of deposits has gone up. But the market appears to be fine with that, as the company looks confident about a 15 percent loan growth for the year. Outlook for the banking sector in general is positive at the moment, but the trouble is that too many people are positive. As ICICI Prudential MF’s S Naren said in an interview to Moneycontrol, a major hurdle to bank stocks’ performance is that too many funds own it.  ICICI Bank vs HDFC Bank  The ICICI Bank may have performed better in recent times, but HDFC Bank could be a better bet at these levels, say the banking analysts at Incred Capital.  Why?  That’s because semi-urban and rural India are the next big growth areas for the Indian banks. Improving ground presence (branches) and faster paced customer acquisition will be key to winning this battle. “We believe that HDFC Bank is relatively better placed on both these formats compared to ICICI Bank, which will ensure granular retail asset growth for the bank, along with consistency in revenues,” said the analyst. Five things that gives Incred the confidence to bank HDFC Bank:  - HDFC Bank has opened more branches in the past three years compared to ICICI Bank - HDFC Bank has more individual bank branches in various locations compared to ICICI Bank - Customers acquired, as measured through debit card issuances, remain higher for HDFC Bank - HDFC Bank has managed its market share dominance in credit card issuances as well as spends - Cross-selling opportunity to existing HDFC mortgage customers is high for HDFC Bank  Derivatives time bomb  Axis Bank MF Chief Investment Officer Ashish Gupta has warned that the outsized derivatives markets themselves can itself be a source of additional macro and market risk, as has been seen global cases with (collateralised debt securities) and derivatives contracts. This is in the backdrop of the massive surge in equity options trading in India. Black swan events and resultant spike in volatility in particular can drive exaggerated moves in stock prices and result in market dislocation, Gupta writes.  And, exchanges appear to have taken a leaf out of the FMCG book to boost sales through sachets. “The introduction of shorter duration in options has effectively 'sachet-sized' trading, reducing the capital needed to take on similar risks. Weekly options are cheaper compared to monthly contracts, and buyers gain exposure to the full notional value by paying only 0.5-5 percent for the same,” he writes.  China  JP Morgan’s James Sullivan says his firm is 'overweight' on China. That is because corporate earnings revisions are below an 18-year average, indicating this could be an inflection.  Shipping  Goldman Sachs has forecast a lengthier and potentially more severe downturn for the global shipping industry, and has warned that the market was still ‘too complacent on the depth and duration of the coming shipping recession’, reports Zerohedge.com. According to Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Creuset, freight rates and earnings must continue to decline to the point where there was pressure on pressure on shipping companies to phase out expensive tonnage. Shipping companies have been adding capacity even as freight rates continue to slide.  US treasury yields  Borrowing costs for companies in the US may be rising, but consumers don’t seem to be feeling the pinch of higher rates yet. Spending online, at stores and in restaurants rose a stronger-than-expected 0.7 percent in September from a month earlier, according to the latest US retail sales report. Soon after the report, yields on US Treasury bonds jumped around 13 basis points to 4.86 percent. If consumers keep an already robust economy’s engines humming, rates could stay high for longer, and at some point hurt appetite for stocks.  Job openings  On the face of it, the US labour market looks strong, but there may not be as job openings as one would expect. A Gallup report says employers are looking to their current employees to fill in where postings remain open, reports Bloomberg. Almost 60 percent of employees surveyed by Gallup say their organization has recently asked workers to take on additional responsibilities without additional pay.  Enter the dragon  China could come to the rescue of a tight global diesel market once again, as it did at the end of last year, reports Oilprice.com. The West is headed for the winter season of higher heating oil and gasoil consumption amid low diesel stocks in Europe and the US, lower supply of diesel-yielding higher-sulphur crudes from the Middle East. Signs have begun emerging that Chinese diesel and other fuel exports are picking up, the report says.  No diesel  Sweden’s capital Stockholm plans to ban diesel- and gas-powered vehicles from 2025 within a certain region of its downtown area to reduce traffic and pollution, reports CNBC. Stockholm is not the first to test low-emission areas, but this all-out ban is one of the boldest moves by a major European capital. London and Brussels have several low-emissions zones, and the policies include a mix of fee and fine.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/short-call-unusual-bets-fetch-big-bucks-better-choice-in-banks-and-derivatives-ticking-like-a-time-bomb-11551621.html
HDFC,2023-10-17T15:47:28+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,Why are analysts still bullish on HDFC Bank despite a mixed Q2 show?,"NIMs bottoming out, strong loan growth, network expansion and stable asset quality are some of the factors that favour India's biggest private sector lender ","HDFC Bank shares closed a percent higher on October 17, a day after India’s biggest private lender exceeded analysts’ expectations with a second-quarter net profit of Rs 15,976 crore, though the net interest margin moderated.  This was the first quarterly results for HDFC Bank after it merged with the parent Housing Development Finance Corporation, which means the numbers are not comparable with the previous quarters. Analysts, however, were mostly positive on Q2 performance.    Here are the key factors working in favour of HDFC Bank:  NIMs bottoming out  While the net profit came in above estimates, HDFC Bank disappointed on net interest margins (NIMs), the amount that a bank earns from interest on loans compared to what it is paying in interest on deposits.  Core NIM for the quarter was 3.65 percent on total assets and 3.85 percent on interest earnings assets. HDFC Bank’s NIM stood at 4.1 percent in the previous quarter.  The margins contracted mainly due to surplus liquidity and the impact of the Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR).  Also read: HDFC Bank Q2 earnings growth: 50? 10? 6%? Here is the correct version  On August 10, the Reserve Bank of India asked banks to maintain an I-CRR of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19 and July 28. The move was aimed measure at sucking out the surplus liquidity generated by various factors, including the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system.  Analysts, however, see NIMs bottoming out.  “Impact of ICRR (6-8 bps on NIMs) will go-away from 3Q onwards but overall margins will start showing reasonable impact only from 4Q as the bank may like to carry some buffer liquidity and share of term deposits is still rising,” foreign brokerage firm Jefferies said in a note.  ICICI Securities has a word of caution for investors.  “While the drag from I-CRR has almost ended and thus NIM seems to have bottomed out, we model in only gradual recovery due to heightened competitive intensity and calibrated absorption of excess liquidity,” it said.  Domestic brokerage firm JM Financial echoed the views.  “While we expect NIMs to see sequential improvement going ahead, as the impact of excess liquidity wanes out, it will be difficult to see pre-merger levels as lower-margin home loans of HDFC Ltd gets added to the loan portfolio,” it said.  Strong loan growth  Loan growth was strong at 18 percent YoY and 5.3 percent QoQ, led by robust growth in retail and continued traction in commercial and rural banking. A pick-up was seen in the corporate segment as well.  “HDFC Bank has made a good beginning, and given a huge pace of capacity building, we believe that there are levers in place to sustain this momentum in business growth. Margins are likely to recover gradually, which, along with improved operating leverage, should improve return ratios,” analysts at Motilal Oswal wrote in a note.  They expect HDFC Bank to deliver a CAGR of 18 percent in loans and 21 percent in earnings over FY24-26.  Also Read: HDFC Bank sees 5-10 bps I-CRR impact on net interest margins, says CFO Vaidyanathan  Deposit mobilisation  A major highlight of the Q2 report card was a strong deposit growth of 29.8 percent, as the private lender garnered Rs 1.1 lakh crore of deposits, with 85 percent being retail deposits. The change in the mix toward retail will lead to better margins.  “It was good to see improvement in deposit mobilisation to Rs 1.1 trillion…While the bank is carrying excess liquidity, it is still raising large fresh deposits and securitising loans, we expect these normalize over the next 2-3 quarters with an uptick in loan growth and normalisation of liquidity,” Jefferies added.  Acquisition of deposits remains a key focus area for the bank, JM Financial said, adding it plans to leverage the power of branch banking to source deposits.  Strong retail franchise  The bank added 85 branches during the quarter, taking the count to 7,945. Analysts are enthused by its pace of expansion, especially in rural and semi-urban markets.  HDFC Bank has added 2,213 branches across India in the past two years against 634 branches added by the nearest rival ICICI Bank.  “This will provide the first-mover advantage to HDFC Bank in rural areas. Our analysis suggests that HDFC Bank has significantly improved their presence in eastern and central states of India including UP, Bihar, MP and Northeastern states which are witnessing a sharp surge in organised penetration,” InCred Equities said.  Merger momentum   InCred Equities said its channel checks indicate that while ICICI Bank has been more engaged in mining deeper into the existing customer base, HDFC Bank was more focused on acquiring customers.  “Post recent merger with HDFC Limited, we can visualise large and untapped cross-sell opportunity to existing mortgage customers which can further aid HDFC Bank’s retail growth momentum (especially unsecured) in the near term,” it said.  Stable asset quality  The bank’s accelerated stress recognition from HDFC’s corporate loan portfolio, including construction finance, led to a merged GNPA ratio of 1.3 percent in 2QFY24 (lower than the 1.4 percent as on July 1, post the merger).  However, the bank carries a healthy specific provision coverage ratio (PCR) at 73 percent and has already created a contingent buffer on HDFC loans, pulling up this buffer for the merged entity to 0.7 percent of loans.  PCR refers to the percentage of funds created against NPAs.  “Amid the rising noise around stress build-up in unsecured loans, where the bank has sizable exposure, the higher specific-/contingent-provision buffer provides comfort,” analysts at Emkay Research said.

PAT grew 33.7% QoQ to INR159.8b in 2QFY24. Deposit growth was particularly strong as the bank garnered INR1.1tn of deposits in 2QFY24 (85% retail deposits). Margins compressed sharply to 3.4%, dragged down by excess liquidity and ICRR impact. However, the bank reported an 8% earnings beat, supported by a lower tax rate. NII came in slightly lower than our estimate, but it was offset by robust other income (buoyed by treasury gains). As a result, revenue stood in line with our estimate.

HDFC,2023-10-17T14:41:13+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra,"HDFC Bank Q2 earnings growth: Is it 50, 10 or 6%? Here is the correct version","Contrary to the 50 percent profit growth number doing the rounds, HDFC Bank's consolidated PAT growth is only 10 percent, pointed out analysts as the base quarter numbers do not include HDFC Ltd's numbers","HDFC Bank's first quarterly results post-merger have left analysts and investors scratching their heads. Contrary to the 50 percent profit growth number doing the rounds, HDFC Bank's consolidated PAT growth is far lower, pointed out some analysts.  On October 16, HDFC Bank which has now merged with its parent HDFC Ltd, reported a quarterly consolidated net profit of Rs 16,811 crore, up 51 percent YoY from Rs 11,125 crore in the same period last year. The problem here is the base number or the number for the year-ago quarter does not include the profit reported by HDFC Ltd for that quarter.  The earnings growth of 50 percent thus is grossly exaggerated as it compares the merged entity’s profits with that of the bank only for the prior period.  Also Read: HDFC Bank Q2 marred by merger, margin recovery on cards: Should you buy or sell the stock?  Breaking down HDFC Ltd's profit in the base quarter  This was called out by CapitalMind’s Deepak Shenoy in his X thread. He corrected the base figure to conclude that the bank reported a 10.2 percent growth in profit. Here is the math.  In Q2 FY23, HDFC Ltd reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 7,042 crore, including the profit share of subsidiaries and associates. Shenoy deducted the HDFC Bank’s share of profits (as it was an associate company where HDFC had a 24 percent stake prior to the merger) from the consolidated number and added the resultant profit number to the prior period profits of HDFC Bank.  HDFC Bank's share in HDFC Ltd’s profit for Q2 FY23 stood at Rs 2,954 crore; deducting this, its bottomline stood at Rs 4,088 crore. Now, adding this number to HDFC Bank's consolidated profit (Rs 11,125 crore) for the same period, throws up Rs 15,213 crore as the prior period profit for the merged entity. Taking this as the base, the net profit growth for Q2 FY24 works out to 10.2 percent.  &quot;HDFC Bank used to easily deliver 15 percent or more (heck, we used to call it the excel sheet results) But hey, it's just merged, so stuff will be tough a little,&quot; Shenoy said in his X thread.  Also Read: HDFC Bank sees 5-10 bps I-CRR impact on net interest margins, says CFO Vaidyanathan  What if we compare standalone numbers?  That does not seal the growth picture though. There is a chink in this calculation: the base number according to Shenoy takes into consideration the consolidated numbers for HDFC Ltd, including the profits of its subsidiaries.  To get a sense of the lending operations of the business, which is the mainstay for the bank, analysts usually look at standalone numbers. Thus, brokerage firm Jeffries in its report highlighted an even lower growth rate – 6 percent. Here is their math.  In Q2 FY23, HDFC had reported a standalone net profit of Rs 4,454 crore. Now, adding this to HDFC Bank's standalone profit (Rs 10,605 crore) gives Rs 15,054 crore. Taking this as the base, the net profit growth for Q1 FY24 is only 6 percent, at Rs 15,976 crore as reported by the merged entity.  Indeed, this is how the lending business of HDFC-HDFC combined has fared in the past one year. That would qualify as unimpressive performance according to analysts. But the story isn’t over yet.  Also Read: The retail craze | Nifty 500 stocks where public shareholder base boomed since Covid days  Standalone or consolidated growth matters?  One question to ask from an investor perspective, which growth numbers are more relevant to look at: standalone or consolidated? Usually, analysts look at standalone numbers to get a sense of how the main-line of business is doing. Otherwise, from an investor perspective, consolidated number should be the defacto standard as that is what gives a complete picture of the company’s overall performance, which is what is relevant to get a view on the stocks’ fair price.  After all, any improvement or deterioration in the subsidiaries does impact the company’s overall net worth. Here, HDFC Life Insurance, HDFC Ergo and HDFC AMC were earlier subsidiaries of HDFC Ltd. Now, they are subsidiaries of HDFC Bank which makes the comparison more complex.  While the 6 percent growth does look anaemic, some analysts feel that the comparison is not appropriate because of the difference in accounting standards. “It’s hard to hazard a guess on what could be the difference in earnings caused by the change in accounting standard,” said an analyst who did not wish to be quoted.  Why such poor growth?  The poor growth seems to be a result of moderation in lending and damage caused by a change in accounting standard.  Notably, HDFC Bank reported a sharp contraction in NIM (net interest margin) at 3.4 percent compared to 4.1 percent YoY. The management in the post-earnings call explained that some adjustments to the NIM were due to the fact that HDFC’s accounting before the merger was as per IndAS. The numbers are now restated according to Indian GAAP, in line with HDFC Bank’s accounting.  Could this make such a large dent in profits? Analysts won’t hazard a guess, but Nikunj Pugalia, deputy group chief financial officer at Neo Group said that IndAS accounting is more intent-based, while IGAAP is an old methodology.  Also Read: Here are top PMS funds in September, most of them are fairly new  &quot;From FY17, all companies were asked to move to IndAS, based on networth, but this was not applicable for banks,&quot; he said. &quot;For instance, in IndAS, when a loan is disbursed, all upfront costs, fees incurred to disburse that loan is amortised over the lifetime of the loan. In GAAP, it is accounted for upfront,&quot; Pugalia added.  In case of provisioning for bad loans too, IndAS allows for the expected credit loss method while in GAAP, provisions are to be made for loans that have not been repaid 90 days past the due date.  Post-merger, GNPA/NNPA ratios have now increased marginally to 1.3 percent/ 0.4 percent, on the back of a 22 basis point impact from higher NPAs related to HDFC’s non-retail loans. NPA stands for non-performing assets.  The exact impact of accounting change in bottomline is not clear. Moneycontrol has written to HDFC Bank for a clarification on the same and the story will be updated once we get a reply.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hdfc-bank-q2-earnings-growth-50-10-6-here-is-the-correct-version-11545221.html

As the impact of ICRR and surplus liquidity will recede, NIM expansion will be seen from Q4.","HDFC Bank, India's largest private sector lender, reported mixed results for the first quarter following the merger with HDFC Ltd. Although the bank reported that its net profit surged 50 percent over the last year, its core business growth was weighed down by lower-than-expected net interest margins (NIMs) and net interest income (NII).  Despite the recent underperformance, brokerages remained bullish on the HDFC Bank stock as they expect sequential improvement in core earnings momentum and NIMs recovery. As the impact of ICRR (incremental cash reserve ratio) and surplus liquidity will recede, expansion will be seen from the fourth quarter.  Q2 earnings encouraging  HDFC Bank's growth in net interest income (NII) is expected to reaccelerate from here on, noted Morgan Stanley. The international brokerage issued a 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,100 per share. The lenders' retail deposit accretion at over Rs 90,000 crore is encouraging. However, going forward, sustenance of this momentum will be key.

NIMs were lower at ~3.6% based on interest earning assets for the merged entity in Q2FY24 vs ~3.7-3.8% in Q1FY23 based on the proforma disclosed earlier. Excess liquidity built up required for LCR and for incremental CRR led to ~25 bps negative impact on NIMs resulting in NII missing consensus and our estimates by 3%/2% respectively. Management guided that NIMs would normalize gradually over the next few quarters as liquidity was made available through debt funding and it would require time to retire as they are not short term in nature.

While NIM was affected (-37bps QoQ) by surplus liquidity, we believe margins have bottomed out as excess cash has already been drawn down which should normalize NIM in H2FY24E.

Because they have a track record of disrupting any segment they enter, telecom being a classic example,” he said.  Parikh’s view is in contrast with that of some banking analysts who feel Jio Financial may not try to disrupt the NBFC segment given that the dynamics of the lending business are much different from say an industry like telecom or retail.  “Right now Jio is quoting at one time book, which is a huge discount to other players. This gap can be bridged if they decide to do things the usual way. But if Jio decides to adopt a similar strategy that it had in the telecom sector, which is to cut prices sharply, then it is bad news for other players. When market booms, financials do well, but at this point valuations of financial services firms are not exactly cheap” he said.  Also Read: A question of values: How Jio Financial Services stacks up against rivals  “You have banks like HDFC Bank and Kotak having net interest margins of anywhere between 3-4 percent. Now it has become easier to raise money from overseas markets cheaply. If you are saying that some of the Indian banks are world class, then their margins too will have to comparable to those of world class companies. Globally NIMs are between 1-1.5. So I think in India too NIMs will contract. The second thing that will happen is that fintech companies and smart NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Chola will take away market share in the small ticket loan segment. Right now the share of financials in the index is 40-45 percent. I think that can come down by a good extent,” he said.  Parikh said the good thing about banks and financial services right now is that the asset quality is much better than what it has been in a long time.

One phone call is enough to create a bad loan,” he said.  Make in India  Parikh is bullish on manufacturing, and because of the trend of lot of manufacturing shifting to India. Like most other sectors, here too investors may have to put up with high valuations for a while, he feels.  “India’s infrastructure is also going to grow in a big way….lot of it is in the price already, I am not saying rush in to buy today,” he said.  “For instance, Timken US has stopped manufacturing two of their products in the US and now producing them in India.

But if a family office which has the funds, understands the industry well, and is willing to take a long term view, enters the picture, they may decide to deploy a part of their money, and keep scaling that position over time instead of waiting for valuations to correct and risk missing out,&quot; he said.

The reported net interest margins (NIM) of the HDFC Bank was at 3.4 percent on total assets in the July-September quarter.  Core net interest margins of the bank in the reporting quarter were at 3.65 percent on total assets and 3.85 percent on the interest earnings asset, a press release from the company said.  On August 10, the RBI asked scheduled banks to maintain an I-CRR of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19 and July 28.  The measure was intended to absorb the surplus liquidity generated by various factors, including the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system.  The central bank, on September 8, took the decision to discontinue the I-CRR in a phased manner, after the review. It added that the amount under I-CRR would be released in stages so that system liquidity is not subjected to sudden shocks and money markets function in an orderly manner.  On September 8, the central bank said that 25 percent of the funds maintained in the I-CRR would be released on September 9 and 25 percent on September 23. The remaining 50 percent will be released on October 7.  Also read: Call money market volumes remain low despite RBI nudge  Even after the complete reversal of I-CRR, liquidity in the banking system remained tight.

This will be the first quarterly earnings announcement since group company HDFC was merged into it. Analysts are expecting some pressure on net interest margins (NIM) because of the merger as well as the incremental Cash Reserve ratio (ICRR) stipulations of the RBI.  The bank is set to announce its results on October 16.  Last month, broking firm Nomura had trimmed its NIM forecast for HDFC Bank while downgrading the stock. NIM could see pressure over the next two to three quarters as HDFC’s second quarter opening book NIMs were at 2 percent versus 2.7 percent in Q1. This was mainly on account of excess liquidity being carried post-merger, Nomura said.

The bank’s Net Interest Income (NII) is set to touch Rs 28,089.9 crore, a YoY increase of 33.6 percent.  The bank’s merger with HDFC has resulted in strong deposits and loans. In its Q2 business update, HDFC Bank said its deposits grew 29.9 percent YoY to Rs 21,73,000 crore. Its CASA (Current and Savings account) deposits have gone up 7.6 percent YoY to Rs 8,17,500 crore, while CASA ratio has reduced to 37.6 percent from 45.4 percent in the previous year. Its gross advances also grew 57.7 percent to Rs 23,54,500 crore.  The bank’s gross Non Performing Assets (NPA) are set to increase to 1.4 percent in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points (bps) from the previous year, with Net NPA expected to rise to 1.3, a 10 bps hike.  Analysts focus on margins  “We expect the bank to deliver 1.6 percent RoA in Q2, with Q2 NIMs impacted by liquidity reserve requirements and ICRR. We will watch out for trends in its post-merger RoA profile, as well as how much of the impact on its Net Interest Margins (NIM)s are structural vs transient.” said Nomura.  NIM for the quarter is expected to come down to 3.5 percent from 4.1 percent in the previous year. This is also set to affect Return on Asset (RoA) which is expected to decline to 1.6 percent from 2 percent from the previous year.  The downside risks for HDFC Bank, according to analysts, are:  1) Non recovery of the NIM /RoA as estimated, would get the stock to be de-rated as the gap of its operating metrics to the nearest competitor would expand.  2) Loan growth remaining lacklustre  3) Sharper than estimated NIM impact due to repo cuts in FY25e.

Hence, below the same, the index can extend downward journey towards August low which comes to around 19,200, but in case, given formation of Doji kind of candlestick pattern at the downtrend, the rebound can be a possibility and if the index sustains above 19,500 then 19,700-19,800 can be key resistance area, experts said.  The Nifty50 fell 93 points to 19,436, and the BSE Sensex dropped 286 points to 65,226, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices plummeted more than 1 percent each on negative breadth.

Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares &amp;amp; Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Avenue Supermarts  Since the last two trading sessions, DMart has started to gain momentum after consolidating between Rs 3,600 and Rs 3,700. In the previous trading session, it took out its previous swing high of Rs 3,850.  From the indicator front, daily DMIs (directional movement index) have given a positive cross along with RSI (relative strength index) reversing from 40 levels, thus hinting towards a further bullish stance in the counter.  One can buy between Rs 3,825 and Rs 3,850; the upside target is expected near Rs 4,100, and the stop-loss would be Rs 3,700 on a daily close basis.    Hindustan Unilever  After making the high of Rs 2,769 in July 2023, it has been making lower tops and lower lows, which resulted in a 11.73 percent cut in price. At the current juncture, the said counter has halted near its support of Rs 2,440–2,450 since the last 12 trading sessions.  Also, there is bullish divergence spotted near the support zone (refer to the chart). A decisive close above Rs 2,500 will lead to fresh long entries, so one can buy only above Rs 2,500 for a target of Rs 2,650 with a stop-loss of Rs 2,425 on a daily close basis.    HDFC Bank  After making the high of Rs 1,670 on September 15, 2023, it has been making lower tops and lower lows, which resulted in a 11 percent cut in price. At the current juncture, the said counter has halted near its support of Rs 1,485–1,500.  Additionally, in the previous session, it made a Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern (possibly can become Bullish Engulfing) near the support zone, followed by bullish divergence near the support zone (refer to the chart), which is looking lucrative.  So, one can buy only above in the range of Rs 1,510–1,530 for a target of Rs 1,600 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,450 on a daily close basis.

HDFC,2023-09-25T13:08:17+05:30,Shivam Shukla,HDFC Bank merger fosters near-term caution but analysts stay upbeat,HDFC Bank stock has lost 1.82 percent of its value over the last six months. The benchmark Nifty Bank index has given a return of 13.68 percent over the same duration.  ,"HDFC Bank's share price has fallen more than six percent in the last three sessions since the company’s analyst meet to share the details of the HDFC merger, due to near-term concerns on asset quality, excess liquidity, and net worth. While brokerages largely remain bullish and have favorable calls on HDFC Bank stock, they advise caution in the near term, with some even cutting the target price.  Brokerages highlighted a decline in HDFC Bank's standalone book value due to accounting changes and near-term pressure on net interest margins on the back of a hike in incremental cash reserve ratio to tackle excess liquidity and elevated competition as overhangs for the lenders. On September 22, HDFC Bank stock ended at Rs 1,530, down 1.5 percent from the previous close.  Why brokerages feel near-term pressure on HDFC Bank stock  Asset Quality and Earnings Impact:  Brokerage firms note a potential impact on asset quality metrics, including an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) from ex-HDFC's real estate portfolio. Earnings estimates and Net Interest Margins (NIMs) are expected to be affected by factors, such as Interest on Cash Reserve Ratio (ICRR) and excess liquidity.  Impact of Merger on Net Worth and Book Value Per Share:  The merger with HDFC is anticipated to result in changes to net worth, with one-time adjustments noted by multiple firms. However, these adjustments are often described as timing differences or transitional. While there may be some weakening of Book Value Per Share (BVPS), most of it is considered non-cash and transitional in nature.  HDFC Bank stock call: Brokerages mostly bullish; check target prices  Kotak Institutional Equities has cut its target on HDFC Bank stock to Rs 1,850 from 1,925 earlier. &quot;There is a reduction in net worth to account for policy, accounting alignments, and dividend payout. The NPL in the parent entity is higher than expected but further negative surprises should be negligible. Re-rating is some time away as the bank has to work through the net interest margin (NIM) transition and build its thesis of differentiation, which we are still less certain about,&quot; said Kotak.

Marginal worsening of headline asset quality metrics. Expect depressed earnings in the next few quarters due to one-off factors.

They want to have 13,000-14,000 branches in the next 4-5 years. But how well they do each quarter might change, depending on finding good places for branches, signing leases, and hiring staff.”  Goldman Sachs has a &quot;Buy&quot; rating on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,051 per share. The bank recently decided to gradually withdraw I-CRR, which could have an impact of about Rs 400 crore. However, the bank's market value has dropped by a significant Rs 29,000 crore since the announcement. Now that the uncertainty appears to have waned, the brokerage firm continues to remain positive on HDFC Bank. The firm expects the bank will have the best earnings growth in its sector -- around 17 percent through FY 23-26.  UBS has a 'buy' rating on HDFC Bank stock with a target price of Rs 1,900 per share. The report added: &quot;Clarity on the merged balance sheet is going to be the key driver for the bank. Q1 net interest margin (NIM) is going to be impacted By ICRR And excess liquidity.&quot;  Jefferies has a 'buy' rating on HDFC Bank stock with a target price of Rs 2,030 per share. &quot;Impact on net interest margins (NIMs) will be a tad higher than expected due to higher liquidity.&quot;  HDFC Bank stock performance  HDFC Bank stock has lost 1.82 percent of its value over the last six months.

Aggarwal said that one cannot question the investment thesis for the stock in the long term as there is visibility for the merged entity to achieve 2 percent Return on Assets (ROA) by FY26. &quot;There will be gradual improvement in earnings. The liquidity (from HDFC Ltd) is a big monitorable over the coming quarters and can help the business grow,&quot; he said, adding that HDFC group has sustained on- track execution to deliver returns.  Also Read: For HDFC Bank, FY24 is a speedbump year  The current multiple of 2.6 times price-to-book value for the bank remains attractive for Aggarwal. However, with the merger being implemented and the entity becoming extremely large, execution remains critical, he said.  Aggarwal highlighted that deposit growth will be the first key metric that investors will be watching out for. This is because the bank experienced a very strong run in Q1, while Q1 was slightly softer. “Going forward, the competition will remain tight, but the performance of the bank on deposits and thereafter even the advances shall be looked at, to evaluate the growth of the merged entity along with the margins” he said.  For the next one quarter, Aggarwal would prefer to wait out and take a breather from the HDFC Bank owing to the excess liquidity built up post merger. The deployment of this liquidity is yet to be seen, said Aggarwal.

On September 21, the benchmark indices extended downtrend for the third consecutive session, with back-to-back gap down moves. The Nifty50 dropped 159 points to 19,742, and the BSE Sensex tanked 571 points to 66,230, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices were down 0.9 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively on weak breadth.  The Nifty Bank played crucial role in market's downtrend for the last two sessions, falling 760 points to 44,624 and formed a long bearish candlestick pattern on the daily scale, while the Nifty IT continued to consolidate, down by 29 points to 32,920.  Stocks that fared better than broader markets and equity benchmarks included HDFC Bank, L&amp;amp;T Technology Services, and HPCL. HDFC Bank has formed a Doji or High Wave kind of pattern on the daily timeframe, after significant correction in the previous two sessions, which could possibly indicate oversold levels. The stock fell 0.66 percent to end at Rs 1,553, after testing the lowest level since March 16 during the day.  L&amp;amp;T Technology Services rose 1.1 percent to Rs 4,660 and formed decent bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with above average volumes, after weakness in the previous three sessions. The stock still holds the low of September 13, coinciding with the 20-day EMA (exponential moving average), which may act as a support.  HPCL has formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe, with above average volumes, continuing an uptrend for three days in a row, but still within the robust bearish candlestick pattern formed on September 12. The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) showed bullish crossover with above 50 levels. The stock rose 2.2 percent to Rs 263.5.  Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today.  HDFC Bank  On the daily scale, the stock had been in a downtrend. Therefore, it is currently into an oversold territory and available near its demand area. The texture of the chart formation on daily and weekly time frame along with technical indicator RSI (relative strength index) is indicating at pullback rally, which could lead to a new leg of the uptrend from its demand zone.  In the near term, Rs 1,500 would be the immediate support zone for the stock. Above the same, the upward rally could continue towards Rs 1,670 levels.  Hindustan Petroleum Corporation  After sharp decline from the higher levels, the counter is in the accumulation zone where it was trading in a rectangle formation. However, on the daily charts there is a gradual up move in the counter along with incremental volume activity, which suggest a new leg of bullish trend in the near term.  Unless it is trading below Rs 250 positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 280.  L&amp;amp;T Technology Services  The stock has shown a remarkable up move in the last few weeks. The stock is trading in a rising trend continuously and forming the higher lows series. The strong bullish momentum on daily and weekly scale suggest that the counter is likely to maintain bullish continuation chart formation in the coming horizon.  As long as the counter is trading above Rs 4,480 the bullish formation is likely to continue. Above which, the counter could move up to Rs 4,980.

Book value is essentially the value of a company's total assets minus its total liabilities. At 9:30 am, HDFC Bank stock was quoting at Rs 1,578.05, down 3.13 percent from previous close.  Catch all the market updates LIVE  &quot;Downward adjustment to the incoming net worth of HDFC Ltd (largely due to IGAAP accounting and provisioning harmonization) amounts to a book value per share cut of Rs 23 per share for the merged entity,&quot; said analysts at Nomura.  They have cut target price for HDFC Bank to Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,920 earlier. The current target price indicates 10 percent upside from HDFC Bank's closing price on September 18.  The broking firm further said that net interest margins (NIM) could see pressure over the next two to three quarters as HDFC Ltd's Q2FY24 opening book NIMs are at 2 percent versus 2.7 percent in Q1. This is mainly on account of excess liquidity being carried post-merger.  On back of this, Nomura has cut its net NIM estimates by 25 basis points in FY24 and 15-20 bps in FY25-26F. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. It has also bumped up a cost-to-income estimate to 40 percent in FY24F versus 36 percent previously.  &quot;Our FY24F earnings per share has been cut 9 percent, with ~5 percent cuts in FY25-26F. Our FY24 return on assets estimate is now at 1.7 percent versus 1.9 percent earlier, gradually improving to 1.8 percent in FY25-26F,&quot; Nomura said.  Have other brokerages downgraded too?  Citi has maintained its Buy rating on HDFC Bank, although it has revised its target price down to Rs 2,110 per share. It noted that the entity's non-individual NPA (non performing assets) have been reset to 6.7 percent in June from 3.7 percent in March. A sharp uptick in NPAs due to HDFC Ltd’s corporate loan book is a negative, it added.  Jefferies has also maintained its &quot;Buy&quot; rating on HDFC Bank but has lowered target price to Rs 2,030 per share. The firm has noted that non-performing loans (NPLs) of HDFC Ltd are higher, which now form a big part of the merged entity.  &quot;HDFC Bank now trades at 2.5x 1-year forward book value per share(adjusting for subsidiaries), which is similar to ICICI Bank despite a comparatively lower loan growth and RoA outlook,&quot; said Nomura.

HDFC,2023-09-15T11:45:53+05:30,Shivam Shukla,"PSU bank stocks beat private peers in one-year returns, keep brokerages upbeat","Amid turbulent market conditions marked by high interest rates and inflation, the Nifty PSU Bank Index tracking the performance of PSBs has surged by a noteworthy 52 percent over the past year","Stocks of public sector banks (PSBs) have emerged as the champions of the Indian banking sector in the last one year, leaving private sector counterparts trailing behind and drawing further optimistic forecasts. Analysts are now eyeing continued growth in PSU banks, likely to be propelled by consolidation efforts, credit growth and improving asset quality.  Over the past one year, shares of PSBs such as UCO Bank and Punjab &amp;amp; Sind Bank have given astonishing returns of over 187 percent and 148 percent, respectively. Bank of Maharashtra and Central Bank of India have also gained significantly, rising 126.12 percent and 92.72 percent, respectively.  Amid turbulent market conditions marked by high interest rates and inflation, the Nifty PSU Bank Index tracking the performance of PSBs has surged by a noteworthy 52 percent over the past year. This is far higher than the Nifty Bank Index’ 12 percent gain in the same period.  For the week (September 8-15), Nifty PSU Bank index rose 7.2 percent, while Nifty Private Bank index up nearly 2 percent.  PSB stocks cheer, private bank stocks face challenges  The rebound in the PSB stocks is in stark contrast to the mixed performance in private sector banks. While HDFC Bank posted a respectable 9.28 percent return over the past year, it remained relatively modest compared to PSB counterparts. Kotak Mahindra Bank grappled with challenges, registering a return of -5.93 percent. However, ICICI Bank maintained stability with a return of 7.15 percent. Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank displayed more robust performances, with returns of 23.58 percent and 27.28 percent, respectively.  Also Read: Insurance houses bought Bajaj Finance, IndiGo in August, trimmed HDFC Bank  However, while analysts remain bullish on the banking sector, the implementation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) guidelines is expected to play a pivotal role, with assessments suggesting a potential impact ranging from 1 to 2.5 percent of loans for PSBs, according to Morgan Stanley.  This has led a few brokerages to become more selective with state-run banks, with Punjab National Bank (PNB) being downgraded to &quot;underweight&quot;. In contrast, BOB, Bank of India (BOI) and SBI are viewed favorably due to their stronger balance sheets.  Brokerage views on PSBs  Morgan Stanley on SBI, PNB and BOB  Analysts at Morgan Stanley have given SBI an &quot;equal-weight&quot; rating with a target price of Rs 670 per share. They highlight SBI's strong performance in the retail and small and medium enterprises (SME) segments. However, domestic loan growth has slowed a bit, leading the bank to focus more on its overseas loan book. SBI has also reiterated its guidance of 12-14 percent loan growth for FY24. The brokerage notes that SBI's management expects some margin moderation as funding costs catch up.   Top 5 Public Sector Banks Brokerage Estimates  However, in a note, the analysts explained their rationale for being cautious, stating, &quot;We get more selective on SoE (state-owned enterprise) banks after strong performance over the past month and likely peaking of rates: Banks that face greater impact from ECL norms are likely to see a delay in the re-rating cycle, even as earnings estimate upgrades are set to continue,&quot;  Morgan Stanley on the other hand downgraded PNB from &quot;equal weight&quot; to &quot;underweight&quot; in a recent report citing a relatively higher potential impact from ECL provisioning. The note mentioned lower coverage ratios, higher gross and net non-performing loans formation and historical credit costs as contributing factors. Comparatively, Bank of India (BOI) and Bank of Baroda (BOB) have better capital and coverage, providing some relative comfort.  BOB received a favorable mention, with the brokerage firm noting its good capital and coverage, as well as a better asset quality track record compared to other banks.  Brokerage Views on private sector banks  Brokerage firm Mirae Asset Securities in a sectoral report on banks released on September 7 stated, “FY24 starts on a good note with healthy earnings performance, albeit minor hiccups in net interest margins (NIM). Overviewing the performance of 10 private banks (from Nifty Private Bank Index) and 12 PSU banks (Nifty PSU Index) for 1QFY24, earnings performance was largely on-track.”  Also Read: No US Fed rate cuts until next year, says Julius Baer’s Mark Matthews  The report added, “The PSU Bank Index continues to outperform (~54 percent) compared to Private Bank Index (14 percent) over the past one year. PSB valuation discount with private banks remains in the range of 60-70 percent. If current earnings trend sustains throughout FY24 along with conducive macro indicators supporting narrowing of the ROA (return on assets) gap, we believe ~50 percent valuation gap is possible for PSBs. We believe for private banks steady performance will ascertain further upside.”  Goldman Sachs on HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank  Goldman Sachs assigned HDFC Bank a &quot;buy&quot; rating with a target price of Rs 2,051 per share in a recent report. It discussed the recent decision to withdraw incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR) in a phased manner, estimating an impact of $48 million or Rs 400 crore. Despite this, however, they note that the bank has lost a significant market capitalization of $3.5 billion or Rs 29,000 crore since the announcement. Goldman Sachs remains positive, as it believes the core thesis remains intact and forecast sector-leading earnings growth of 17 percent in FY23-26.   Top 5 Private Banks Brokerage Estimates  Kotak Mahindra Bank is rated &quot;equal-weight&quot; by Morgan Stanley, with a target price of Rs 2,250 per share. The report mentions healthy loan demand in the retail and SME segments, improved margins in FY23 (peaking in Q4FY23), and benign asset quality. Operating costs remain elevated due to higher growth momentum and tech investments.  Morgan Stanley on ICICI Bank  ICICI Bank receives an &quot;overweight&quot; rating from Morgan Stanley with a target price of Rs 1,350 per share. The bank's strong loan growth and competitive intensity are noted. Management has reiterated its guidance of maintaining FY24 margins at levels similar to FY23. Over the medium term, the bank expects operating leverage to come into play.  Jefferies on Axis Bank  Axis Bank is given a &quot;buy&quot; rating by Jefferies with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share, citing the management's confidence in achieving a sustainable 18 percent return on equity. It also emphasises the bank's focus on improving its funding profile to reduce volatility. Margin stability and attractive valuations make Axis Bank its top pick.

India's life insurance industry, excluding LIC of India, has an aggregate equity AUM (assets under management) of nearly Rs 4.2 lakh crore. According to data compiled by Nuvama's Insurance Portfolio Analyser, the top five players  - ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, HDFC Life Insurance, Tata AIA Life Insurance and Kotak Life Insurance -  represent almost 80 percent of this AUM.  In the month gone by, notable additions by these insurance houses included Bajaj Finance, Interglobe Aviation worth Rs 299 crore, Union Bank worth Rs 235 crore and Star Health also worth Rs 235 crore.  Meanwhile, significant reductions were Jio Financial Services worth Rs 558 crore, HDFC Bank worth Rs 479 crore, Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra worth Rs 352 crore and Infosys worth Rs 326 crore.  Despite the trimming of stake in M&amp;amp;M, all insurance houses are overweight on the auto sector. On the Nifty 100, the auto sector has weightage of 4.9 percent while in insurance portfolios it is over 6.5 percent.  All the five houses are also overweight on capital goods and pharma &amp;amp; healthcare. On the Nifty 100, capital goods has a weightage of 4.7 percent while insurance portfolios have more than 6 percent. Similarly, pharma has a weightage of 3.4 percent in Nifty 100, while insurance houses have over 3.7 percent.  Surprisingly, except HDFC Life, all other insurance houses are underweight on financial services sector - the darling on investors and analysts.

However, growth should accelerate (15% CAGR over FY24-26E), as mortgage engine fires up from the bank’s platform, which along with the gradual replacement of HDFCL’s high-cost borrowings (80-85% to be replaced via retail deposits), as they mature, should lead to margin normalization. We have cut our earnings/BV est. by ~4%/5-6% to reflect the nearterm margin softness, higher opex due to investments in the phygital network, and mergerrelated adjustments. Thus, we revise our TP to Rs2,100 (valuing the core bank at 2.8x its Sep-25E ABV+subs/inv. value at Rs185) from Rs2,150. However, retain BUY, as we believe the merger drag should ease soon, which along with improvement in the bank’s RoA/RoE back to ~2%/16-17% over FY25-26E, benefiting from the merger’s synergies, should be positive. Further, given KMB undergoing mgmt. transition (typically leading to business/valuation softness as seen in HDFCB), HDFCB with stable mgmt., better return profile and valuation (2x vs. 2.1x for KMB) offers a good bet from a medium-long term view. The long-awaited listing of HDB Fin should be another stock catalyst going ahead.  Outlook We have cut our earnings/ABV est. by ~4%/5-6% to reflect near-term margin softness, higher opex due to investments in the phygital network, and merger-related adjustments. However, we expect the bank’s RoA/RoE to improve from 1.9%/15.6% in FY24E (merged) to ~2%/17% by FY26E, benefiting from better growth/margins and fees, as merger synergies kick in.

HDFC,2023-09-03T10:01:24+05:30,Latha Venkatesh,Uday Kotak ends one brilliant chapter at the bank despite run-ins with the regulator,"While Uday Kotak took very few risks with his lending, he did take regulatory risks. He has been the only banker to have taken the regulator, the RBI, to court on the issue of not bringing down his stake in the bank to 15 percent.","Uday Kotak resigns as managing director and chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank after a scintillating two decades. In these 20 years, he has built a solid franchise with a deposit base of nearly Rs 4 lakh crore, making Kotak the eleventh largest lender in the country in terms of deposit size and fourth-largest among private banks.  Kotak's achievements are, of course, not confined to banking. Starting with bill discounting from 1985, he has built a clutch of financial institutions including a mutual fund, a life insurance, a general insurance company, a couple of NBFCs and a securities company.  The banking licence was awarded to Uday Kotak in 2003  and, for a while, the bank grew largely by providing support to its investment banking and securities companies. The lender took a leap in size and reach when it acquired ING Vysya Bank in 2014.  To Kotak's credit, his has been a near flawless record in terms of quality of the bank's asset book. Even at the height of the asset quality crises that roiled the banking sector in the middle of the last decade, when even large private lenders like ICICI Bank and Axis Bank grappled with soaring non-performing assets (NPA), Kotak Bank, like HDFC Bank, remained largely unscathed.  Not surprising, while it may rank eleventh in deposit size, it features within the top three or four in terms of market cap, thanks to high returns to shareholders. That indeed may also be Uday Kotak's weakness. Probably because of his large shareholding in the bank, he remained a very cautious banker, growing his book by no more than 15-16 percent a year. In contrast, HDFC Bank grew by nearly 25 percent in the 2000s and averaged a growth rate of 20-21 percent in the 2010s. Although Kotak Bank is only eight years younger, HDFC Bank is over five times larger in terms of the size of deposits and advances.  The slower pace of growth may be linked to Uday Kotak's large stake in the bank. In the early years, when he held close to 50 percent in it, Kotak employees were aware that in every loan, they were lending 50 percent of his money and only 50 percent of depositors' money. That made for a cautious DNA down the line.  Ironically, while Uday Kotak took very few risks with his lending, he did take regulatory risks. He has been the only banker to have taken the regulator, the Reserve Bank of India, to court on the issue of not bringing down his stake in the bank to 15 percent within the stipulated time. Eventually, the RBI too modified the rules to let promoters keep 26 percent in the banks they founded.  Uday Kotak's run-in with the regulator may not be over yet. The RBI issued guidelines in 2021, capping the term of an MD and CEO of a bank at 15 years after which he will have to take a three-year cooling-off.  &quot;The post of the MD and CEO or WTD cannot be held by the same incumbent for more than 15 years. Thereafter, the individual will be eligible for re-appointment as the MD and CEO or WTD in the same bank, if considered necessary and desirable by the board, after a minimum gap of three years, subject to meeting other conditions. During this three-year cooling-off, the individual shall not be appointed or associated with the bank or its group entities in any capacity, either directly or indirectly,&quot; the RBI said.  The guidelines are no doubt informed by sound principles of protecting financial stability. The RBI would want to ensure that no untoward actions are undertaken by any individual who leads a bank for a long period. After all, it is the depositors' money at stake. For every Rs 100 loan given by a bank, nearly Rs 90 is depositors' money. The regulator would also not want a large institution to be too dependent on one person.  Despite the guidelines stating that an individual who has been MD for 15 years, should not be associated with bank directly or indirectly for the next three years, Kotak has been selected by the bank's board  as a non-executive director. While the RBI has not reacted to this appointment, it remains to be seen if it would want to see the next MD as an outsider who would be less influenced by his presence in the board.  It is important not to treat this resignation as Kotak hangs his boots. Technically, he can even return as the MD after three years, unless the RBI objects, saying he didn't take the three-year cooling.  Even as the non-executive director, he remains an important voice of the banking sector and indeed of the financial sector, whom the government will, no doubt, reach out to in case of crises like IL&amp;amp;FS. The resignation as the Kotak Mahindra Bank MD and CEO only ends one chapter in Kotak's innings. As the famous Hindi movie line goes: Picture abhi baaki hai.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/uday-kotak-ends-one-brilliant-chapter-at-the-bank-despite-run-ins-with-the-regulator-11300971.html

The HDFC Bank deputy managing director said his firm can now offer home loans at more than three times the locations following its merger with HDFC Ltd. and that’s just the start.  “When he takes a house, he takes a consumer finance loan, which means he’s taking a loan to buy his appliances,” Bharucha said in an interview. “He doesn’t have to go anywhere” else, Bharucha said.  It’s an opportune moment for HDFC Bank as demand from retail customers surges across India, the world’s most populous country.

HDFC,2023-08-12T11:13:17+05:30,PTI,"Post merger, HDFC Bank CEO flags funding risk; says net interest margins to be hit", HDFC Bank chief Sashidhar Jagdishan on Friday flagged funding as a risk for the lender after the successful USD 40 billion amalgamation with its parent.  ,"HDFC Bank chief Sashidhar Jagdishan on Friday flagged funding as a risk for the lender after the successful USD 40 billion amalgamation with its parent.  &quot;As you know, the risks of the merger is the funding part of it,” Jagdishan told shareholders of the largest private sector lender at its maiden annual general meeting after the merger came into effect from July 1. It can be noted that the bank has not been fully successful in getting all the forbearance it had sought from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the liabilities front.  The RBI refused to provide any exemptions on Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirements on the deposits that come from HDFC, which was a deposit-taking entity. Additionally, questions were raised about the likely impact on HDFC Bank with respect to the RBI’s move to put an incremental CRR of 10 per cent on deposit accretions in all the scheduled commercial banks after May. Jagdishan exuded confidence that the bank will be able to surmount the funding challenge, pointing out that the board, senior leadership and staff are cognizant of the work at hand. The Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director said the merger, and the timing, made sense because of the advantages that it offers, and added that the staff is ”excited” to take on the funding challenge. ”I think time will tell but we’re extremely confident at the way that we have grown over the last 10 years, there is no reason why we will not be able to surmount the challenges and even grab the opportunity to grow similarly over the next many years,” he said.  The bank has sought shareholders’ approval to raise up to Rs 50,000 crore from bond issuances going ahead and will be active on this front as part of its liabilities management, Jagdishan said. Merger with HDFC is all set to impact the Net Interest Margins (NIMs) of the bank because of the higher proportion of the low-interest yielding housing loans which get added, Jagdishan said, adding that the same will be visible from the results for the September quarter itself.  However, the housing loans also present advantages in terms of better repayment ratios which lower the credit costs on such advances, Jagdishan said. The bank, which has always reported NIMs between 4-4.4 per cent range, is confident of getting the profitability or the returns back to historical levels in up to 18 months, he said. ”It’s been always a philosophy that we will not compromise growth for profitability,” Jagdishan said. Amid some issues of misbehavior by staff being flagged on social media, including a loud shouting by a senior employee to a subordinate for not meeting business targets, Jagdishan said employees’ satisfaction and organisational culture are priorities for the bank management and the board. He also promised to publish employee satisfaction survey results along with the annual report from next year.  More than 7 per cent of the bank’s overall spending is towards technology, Jagdishan said. He, however, said that more security features may lead to some inconvenience. Meanwhile, the bank’s Non-Executive Chairman Atanu Chakraborty said erstwhile HDFC’s Chairman Deepak Parekh cannot join the board of the bank because of a RBI policy not allowing directors above 75 years of age. Key executives Renu Karnad and Keki Mistry have joined the bank’s board. Jagdishan said a request for approval has been made to the RBI for inducting erstwhile HDFC’s Chief Financial Officer V Srinivasa Ranjan to the board.

The largest merger in India's corporate history made the Mumbai-based private sector lender the world's seventh most valuable bank  ,"The bigger balance sheet of HDFC Bank following its merger with parent Housing Development Financial Corporation (HDFC) will boost fund flow to the affordable housing segment, HDFC Bank chairman Atanu Chakraborty said on August 11.  It will also help the bank to fund agriculture and small and medium-sized business in a better way, he said.  &quot;As a consequence of this merger, the larger balance sheet of the bank would offer to the national economy possibilities of higher credit growth, a larger bouquet of financial products and higher flows into affordable housing, agriculture, MSME etc,&quot; Chakraborty said while addressing the bank's annual general meeting in Mumbai.  HDFC Bank merged with HDFC on  July 1 and the largest merger in India's corporate history made the Mumbai-based private sector lender the world's seventh most valuable bank.  After the merger, the loan book or advances of the merged entity jumped 38.77 percent to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as against 16 lakh crore as on March 31, the bank said in an investor presentation.  The merger gave HDFC Bank entry into India's booming housing loan market, while for HDFC, the decision made sense on account of vanishing regulatory arbitrage available for non-banking finance companies.  The bank will also benefit from the addition of a market-leading home loan product, which can now be directly offered through its large network of branches, helping a greater number of people fulfil their aspirations to be homeowners, Chakraborty said.  The home loan business will also benefit from a low cost of funds that a bank traditionally enjoys, he added.  &quot;It will also enable the bank to offer to its wider customer base a full suite of financial products like life insurance, general insurance, health insurance, and investment products like mutual funds by leveraging the strength of major entities like HDFC Ergo, HDFC Life and HDFC Mutual Fund, which now come into the bank’s fold as a result of the merger,&quot; Chakraborty said.  He said HDFC Bank is well-placed to capitalise on this opportunity, both for financing private investments and consumer finance, aided by its low cost of funds, wide customer reach and a large and stable balance sheet.  &quot;We feel privileged to be a part of this burgeoning economic environment and India’s growth story,&quot; Chakraborty said.  On April 4, 2022, HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge. The move came almost seven years after HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.  In his speech, Chakraborty also talked about key changes in the board. Former HDFC CEO Keki Mistry has joined the board as a non-executive director.  Executive director Kaizad Bharucha has been redesignated as deputy managing director, while Bhavesh Zaveri has joined as an executive director.

SBI posted its highest-ever quarterly earnings at Rs 16,884 crore, soaring 178 percent on-year, though net interest income came in below estimates at Rs 38,905 crore.  “Loan growth sustained across segments, led by continued traction in retail assets (especially Xpress Credit book) and the SME portfolio, which benefited from a gradual pick-up in the investment cycle,” HDFC Securities said in a note to clients.  Axis Bank on July 26 reported a net profit of Rs 5,790 crore for the quarter ended April-June FY24, growing by 40 percent from Rs 4,125 crore last year.  The lender's net interest income (NII) grew 27 percent on a year-on-year (YOY) basis to Rs 11,959 crore, while net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter stood at 4.10 percent, up 50 bps YOY.  ICICI Bank reported a 39.7 percent on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 9,648 crore for the quarter despite elevated provisions and contingencies.  Net interest income increased by 38 percent on-year to Rs 18,227 crore with net interest margin expansion of 77 bps on-year at 4.78 percent, while loan growth was 18.1 percent and deposits grew by 17.9 percent YoY.  Asset quality was stable with gross NPA falling 5 bps sequentially to 2.76 percent and net NPA flat at 0.48 percent for the quarter.  “The bank has the highest earnings certainty over the next three years. Net interest margin (NIM) moderation has been in-line and deposit accretion has picked up pace. Core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) was reported 37 percent higher YoY and the bank will invest in growth in FY24,” brokerage firm CLSA said.  Margin Pressures  While banks had a standout quarter overall, when looked at sequentially, the numbers reveal some stress on the margins front.  For example, the net interest income for SBI declined 4 percent QoQ, led by a sharp 27 bps QoQ decline in net interest margin to 3.33 percent. Axis Bank’s NIMs moderated 12 bps sequentially.  Analysts say catch-up in funding costs following accelerated funds mobilisation is expected to squeeze margins and weigh on banks’ balance sheets in the near-term.  Banks will have to hike interest rates further to chase depositors, and on the other hand, the loan book has been largely repriced as more than half of it is linked to external benchmark lending rate (EBLR).  On the advances side, while banks are chasing retail borrowers, corporate loan offtake is still subdued.  “Banks saw strong margin delivery in FY23, benefiting from lead/lag of asset-liability re-pricing, consumption of internal liquidity and lower NPA formation. However, we believe that the on-balance-sheet liquidity has been largely consumed, while higher deposit growth coupled with the lagging repricing should catch up, leading to margin softness in FY24 for most banks,” analysts at Emkay Global said.  It believes the rate hike cycle is largely behind, thus, managing the liability cost becomes vital for protecting margins. “That said, a few banks with lower loan-to-deposit ratio (such as SBI) or higher share of MCLR (Indian Bank) to be repriced should be able to protect their margins or witness relatively lesser correction. Also, banks with a higher fixed-rate asset book, coupled with a reasonable CASA base, should see margin expansion, once the rate cycle reverses,” it said.

The merged entity is set to extend its lead as the second-largest bank in the country, with a market share of 16% in loans and 11% in deposits. The merger will help the bank improve asset duration and enable sustainable growth over the long term, with mortgage mix rising to 33%. We estimate the loan book to grow to INR 34.7t by FY26E with a ~17% CAGR (B/s size of INR 49t). -About 70% of HDFC Ltd (HDFC) customers do not have a banking relationship with HDFCB, while out of total ~85m customers of HDFCB, only 5% of them have taken mortgages (2% from HDFC Ltd). This offers a significant cross-sell opportunity, and along with aggressive distribution expansion, it would enable healthy loan growth over the medium term. According to the bank, home loan customers have 7x higher deposit balance potential than those not availing home loans. Margins are likely to moderate to ~3.8% in FY24E; however, a gradual re-pricing of borrowings and high-cost deposits of HDFC will lead to a 15-20bp gain in NIM to ~4% by FY26E. We estimate the cost-income (C/I) ratio to moderate to 35% by FY26E, which will compensate for lower margins and will support earnings. Outlook We estimate PAT of INR646b/INR791b/INR963b over FY24/FY25/FY26, translating into RoA of 1.9-2.1%. We estimate RoE to decline in FY24 and thereafter gradually revert to pre-merger levels of 17%+ by FY26E. HDFCB (Buy) remains one of our preferred stocks in the sector with a TP of INR 2,070.

In his message to shareholders, Chakraborty listed the benefits of merger such as increased scale, comprehensive product offering, balance sheet resilience and the ability to drive synergies. &quot;This would enable the Bank to serve its customers in a significantly enhanced way with a bouquet of financial services,&quot; Chakraborty added.  The merger came into effect from July 1.  The entities have formed an integration committee that has been working on various streams across businesses, IT, HR, Risk Management, Operations, Compliance, etc. to make the merger seamless and effective, Chakraborty said.  &quot;We are also putting in place the strategy to ensure that the financial conglomerate that has emerged has in place adequate systems and processes to ensure adherence to the various regulatory regimes and a governance framework for meeting group wide compliance and risk management objectives,&quot; said Chakraborty in his message.  Post-merger, the loan book or advances of the merged entity jumped by 38.77 percent to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as against 16 lakh crore as on March 31, as per investor presentation of bank.  The merger gave HDFC Bank entry to India's booming housing loan market while for HDFC, the decision made sense on account of vanishing reglulatory arbitrage earlier available for non-banking finance companies.   A big opportunity, says CEO  In his message to shareholders, managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan too said the timing of the merger couldn’t have come at a better time.  &quot;This was an opportunity that we truly believed in. Buying a home is a family decision and an emotional one. This emotion is transferred to the home loan service provider and helps build lifelong bonds with the customer and his family,&quot; said managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan in his message to stake holders.  Further, only two per cent of our customers source their home loans through the Bank, while five per cent do it from other institutions. This itself is a huge opportunity, said Jagdishan.  Further, the CEO higligted the opportunities to cross sell products across customers. Explaining the merger rationale, Jagdishan said HDFC Bank with its stronger digital platforms, digital journeys and physical branch network will have the ability to offer the home loan customer 'a complete bouquet of the Bank’s and subsidiaries’ products and services'.  &quot;Savings accounts, personal loans, insurance cover, SIPs can all be bundled along with a home loan to create a compelling value proposition to the customer, that probably does not exist in the market at the scale at which this is envisaged. Going forward this is clearly going to be a game changer,&quot; Jagdishan added.  Jagdishan further added that in line with economic growth, home buying across the country will accelerate and emerge as a key driver of India’s GDP over the next decade, especially affordable housing. Investments in infrastructure are vital for India’s growth. A bigger balance sheet postmerger will enable HDFC Bank to take a larger exposure in infrastructure, the CEO said.  Both HDFC and HDFC Bank had annoucned the decision to merge on April 4, 2022. In fact, HDFC an HDFC Bank merger has been in news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances are in favour.  But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea in backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders.

HDFC,2023-07-18T07:40:12+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,A round-up of top newspaper stories to keep you ahead of others,"#1. Bull run continues in Indian stock markets, shrugging off Asian blues  Indian equity benchmarks have soared to new records after shrugging off concerns of tepid Chinese growth. The Sensex closed at a record level of 66,589.93 points, up 0.8 percent from previous close. It beat Friday’s closing high of 66,060.90. The Nifty reached a fresh all-time high of 19,731.85 points before closing at 19,711.45, up 0.75 percent. Since the lows of March, foreign investors have been net buyers of local stock worth more than Rs 78,000 crore.  Why it’s important: China is slowing down, diverting fund flows into Indian markets. There are, however, concerns the market is becoming overheated, as the volatility index has surged nearly 6 percent.  #2. India pulls 135 million out of poverty in five years since 2015-16  An estimated 135 million Indians were pulled out of multidimensional poverty between 2015-16 and 2019-21, with Bihar and Uttar Pradesh accounting for 56.8 million, a report by the Niti Aayog said. Some 24.9 percent of India’s population were assessed as multidimensionally poor in 2015-16, which declined to 15 percent in 2019-21. In rural areas, the share declined from 32.6 percent to 19.3 percent, while urban areas reported a drop from 8.7 percent to 5.3 percent.  Why it’s important: The reduction was mainly due to improvements in housing, sanitation, water supply and electricity. The estimates do not measure the monetary aspects of poverty, not updated since 2011-12.  #3. HDFC Bank reports 30 percent increase in net profit on lower provisions  HDFC Bank posted a 30 percent rise in net profit, driven by lower provisions for loan losses and increased other income. The first-quarter results do not include earnings of the merged entity, which took effect on July 1. Net profit rose to Rs 11,951.7 crore for the quarter ended 30 June from Rs 9,196 crore a year earlier. Net interest income increased 21.1 percent to Rs 23,599.1 crore.  Why it’s important: The bank went beyond expectations of analysts although it missed sequential projections in asset quality and net interest income. Its retail book is expected to outpace bulk loans.  #4. Corporate advertising spends to surge 20-25 percent in second half of 2023  Advertising spends are expected to surge a record 20-25 percent on year in the second half of 2023, spurred by the cricket world cup and the festive season. Spending is expected to be led by sectors like e-commerce, FMCG, travel and hospitality, apparel, fintech, banking, retail, and automobiles, among others.  Why it’s important: The spike would be due to launches postponed till June, either because of unseasonal rains or inflationary pressures, which will make a comeback in the second half of the year.  #5. Dunzo seeks additional $20 million from Reliance Retail after falling short of target  Dunzo is seeking at least $20 million (Rs 165 crore) more from Reliance Retail, its largest shareholder, after the cash-strapped quick commerce startup fell short of its target to raise $75 million by offering convertible notes. The firm could raise just about $45 million in April, with only Reliance Retail and Google subscribing to the convertible notes and other shareholders staying away.  Why it’s important: Falling short of the fundraising target has landed the company into an adverse cash flow situation. It is unclear whether Reliance would agree to the additional investment.  #6. Temasek Holdings lining up $10 billion to invest in India in the next three years  Singapore’s state-owned investor Temasek Holdings intends to invest $9 10 billion in India over the next three years to cash in on the rising opportunities in consumer retail, healthcare and eco-friendly businesses, India head Ravi Lambah has said. The firm on an average invests $1 billion a year in India, but it has already exceeded the target in 2023-24 due to its $2 billion investment in the Manipal Group.  Why it’s important: Temasek, which has till now invested just 6 percent of its $287 billion portfolio in India, sees increased opportunities in the country that are well aligned with its investment themes.  #7. US to work with India to spur energy transition through increased private investments  The US will work closely with India on an investment platform to lower the cost of capital and increase private investment to speed up India’s energy transition, Us treasury secretary Janet Yellen has said. India and the US held bilateral discussions on the sidelines of the third meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.  Why it’s important: The increased private investment in India’s energy transition would be incumbent on faster reforms in the country. India already offers several incentives, and more are set to follow.  #8. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners buys 5.96 percent stake in Patanjali Foods, sparking rally  Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners has purchased a 5.96 percent stake in Patanjali Foods in its offer for sale. Patanjali had set a floor price of Rs 1,000 a share to sell 25.3 million shares. GQG Partners has now become the largest public shareholder of Patanjali Foods. Following the announcement, shares of Patanjali Foods jumped 2.91 percent.  Why it’s important: Rajiv Jain has made a name for taking contrarian bets. He surprised many after deciding to invest in Adani Group shares despite a market rout earlier this year.  #9. Belgium’s Proximus Group set to purchase Route Mobile for up to Rs 8,598 crore  Belgium’s Proximus Group has agreed to acquire a 57.56 percent stake in Route Mobile from the promoters of the Indian firm for Rs 5,922 crore. In a related transaction, Clear Bridge Ventures, an affiliate of the promoters of Route Mobile, will buy a 14.5 percent non-controlling stake in Proximus Opal for euro 299.6 million.  Why it’s important: The acquisition marks one of the largest cross-border deals in the communication space in India. Route Mobile, which went public in September 2020, provides communication solutions, including automated texts, WhatsApp notifications, voice-based services, and emails.  #10. Zee’s board forms interim panel as Punit Goenka fails to overturn regulator ban  The board of directors of Zee Entertainment Enterprises has formed an interim committee of senior executives to run operations after managing director Punit Goenka’s appeal for relief from a market regulator order barring him from holding key positions in listed firms failed. The interim committee will be under the supervision of the board and will seek its guidance on all matters related to the firm.

Follow our live blog for all the market action  Analysts expect its net interest income (NII) — the difference between interest earned and interest paid — to climb 21 per cent to Rs 23,553 crore, as against Rs 19,481 crore in the year-ago period.  However, the net interest margins (NIMs) – a key measure of profitability – can slip up to 10 bps from 4.1 percent in Q1 FY23.  This is because domestic banks’ funding costs are elevated while lending yields may not have material repricing benefits, analysts said.  Q1 Update  “The Indian banking sector continued to see y-o-y credit growth momentum at mid-teens through 1Q FY24, which should translate into high-teens credit growth for most large banks, especially in sticky loan segments like retail and SME. However, the fact that a highly motivated HDFC Bank could deliver only 10.7 percent CASA growth y-o-y suggests to us that system CASA growth still remains weak,” BNP Paribas analyst Santanu Chakrabarti said in a note.  HDFC Bank had disappointed the Street earlier this month with a lacklustre Q1 business update.  Its advances aggregated to approximately Rs 16.15 lakh crore for the quarter ended June 30, up nearly 15.8 percent year on year (YoY) from Rs 13.95 lakh crore a year ago. The bank's advances grew around 0.9 percent on quarter over quarter (QoQ) basis against Rs 16 lakh crore in Q4FY23.  Deposits jumped 19.2 percent YoY for the said quarter to Rs 19.13 lakh crore, from Rs 16.04 lakh crore in Q1FY23. They were up 1.6 percent QoQ from Rs 18.83 lakh crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.

Results Matrix  HDFC Bank’s earnings expectations have already been rebased after the release of the business update, Nuvama Research said.  “The bank has posted a disappointing business update with deposit growth of 1.6% QoQ and loan growth of 0.9% QoQ versus expectations of 4% QoQ. Even on a consolidated basis, loan growth of 15% YoY and 0.7% QoQ is lower than the guidance of 18% YoY. Standalone NIM will likely remain stable QoQ. Slippage will rise QoQ due to seasonally high agri slippage,” it added.  Concerns on the agri front have been voiced by other experts as well.  “Asset quality is expected to see a slight blip and slippage ratio could rise from 1.26% to 1.46%, driven by agri slippages especially in case of SBI and HDFC Bank,” Prabhudas Lilladher said, adding Q1 usually sees agri delinquencies.  As per Emkay Research, slower business growth, moderating NIMs and slightly higher opex and provisions can keep Q1 profit growth in check for HDFC Bank.  The domestic brokerage sees slippages inching up QoQ due to seasonally high NPAs from the agri portfolio.  “The banking sector has bounced back over the past three months (Nifty Banking index up 10%) due to its inherent resiliency amid bank failures somewhere else, healthy credit growth belying expectations of a slowdown and a stabilizing policy/interest rate environment,” it said.  Though the sharp margin improvement story is largely behind, earnings momentum is expected to remain strong in Q1 and, thus should support the current banking rally with PSBs and small-midcap banks benefiting more.  “Notwithstanding near-term business dislocation due to the merger, we believe HDFC Bank should be back in the game from H2,” it added.  Analysts expect the lender’s asset quality to be steady. HDFC Bank had reported gross NPAs at 1.12 percent in the previous quarter, with net NPAs at 0.27 percent.  This is in line with the improving asset quality of the overall Indian banking system over the past few years.  As per RBI data, Indian banks’ gross NPA ratio declined to 3.9 percent in March 2023 – a 10-year low. The net NPA ratio of the scheduled commercial banks also improved to 1.0 percent, a level last observed in June 2011.  HDFC Bank's total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) as per Basel Ill guidelines was at 19.3 percent as on March 31, 2023, as against a regulatory requirement of 11.7 percent.  Provisions and contingencies for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 were Rs 2,685.4 crore.  Merged Entity Q1 Update  Some key takeaways about HDFC Bank and HDFC’s merged balance sheet:  -Gross advances were up 13.1 YoY and 0.7 percent QoQ basis, reaching Rs 22.45 lakh crore.  - Deposits aggregated to approximately Rs 20.63 lakh crore in Q1FY24, up 16.2 percent YoY and 1.2 percent QoQ.  - The merged entity's average liquidity coverage ratio for the Q1 stood at around 120 percent on a proforma basis.  Shares of HDFC Bank are up 1 percent on YTD basis, though the 1-year return stands at 21 percent.

HDFC,2023-07-13T16:10:29+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Market Moghul: Recounting the HDFC story,The HDFC stock has posted a stellar CAGR of around 19 percent over the last three decades.,"Shares of Housing Development and Finance Corporation (HDFC) stopped trading on July 12, marking the end of an over four-decade-long journey for India’s oldest and biggest mortgage lender.  HDFC now lives on as part of HDFC Bank, but many market veterans view the company as a role model for corporate India and synonymous with the country’s socio-economic progress.  Here are some key highlights of HDFC’s market journey –  Founded by H T Parekh, uncle of Deepak Parekh. Incorporated on October 17, 1977  Deepak Parekh joined the company in 1978, leaving his Chase Manhattan Bank job where he was earning twice the salary offered by HDFC.  Deepak Parekh approached UTI seeking investment in HDFC’s IPO. UTI -- the only mutual fund in India that time -- refused, saying retail lending for home loans was too risky.  HDFC IPO launched in 1978. Issue size – Rs 10 crore (10 lakh shares of Rs 100 each). Shares issued to public at par (no premium).  126 equity shares of Rs 100 taken up by the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association, including 100 shares held by H T Parekh.  50,000 Equity shares of Rs 100 each subscribed by ICICI, the IFC (W) and HH the Aga Khan IV respectively.  4,50,000 equity shares of Rs 100 issued for private subscription.  3,99,874 equity shares of Rs 100 offered to the public. The Corporation received 10,697 applications for 4,73,976 equity shares. The Corporation allotted the shares to 10,543 applicants.  The stock has posted a stellar CAGR of around 19 percent over the last three decades. However, the CAGR for HDFC Bank is higher at 24 percent.    Rs 1,00,000 invested in HDFC in May 1995 would have grown to Rs 1,26,39,000 today (without dividends). However, Rs 1,00,000 invested in HDFC Bank would have increased to Rs 4,14,00,000 (without dividends).  HDFC received approval for setting up HDFC Bank in 1994. The bank was inaugurated in February 1995 by the then Finance Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.  HDFC took 33 years to hit the Rs 1-lakh crore m-cap mark. HDFC Bank reached the milestone in 15 years.    &amp;nbsp;  HDFC's market capitalisation reached Rs 2 lakh crore in February 2015, Rs 3 lakh crore in February 2018, Rs 4 lakh crore in July 2019, and Rs 5 lakh crore in February 2021.  In FY2000, HDFC’s net profit at Rs 400 crore was almost four times that of HDFC Bank at Rs 120 crore.  HDFC maintained its lead for the next decade. In FY2010, HDFC Bank overtook its parent in terms of net profit at Rs 2,949 crore vs Rs 2,826 crore for HDFC. The lead only widened over time.  For the financial year ended March 2023, HDFC reported a net profit of Rs 16,239 crore, compared to Rs 44,109 crore for HDFC Bank.    Even in terms of topline growth, HDFC Bank has usually outperformed its parent.    The HDFC IPO was a tepid affair, with shares listing below the issue price. Even at its last trading session on July 12, 2023, the share closed in the red, down nearly 1 percent at Rs 2,724.30 on the NSE.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-moghul-recounting-the-hdfc-story-10952931.html
HDFC,2023-07-12T19:00:19+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,An era ends as HDFC shares stop trading on stock exchanges,"HDFC’s growth story is also the story of India’s home loan market over decades. At one point, this company was the only home loan provider in India.","On July 12, the shares of Housing Development and Finance Corporation, or HDFC, stopped trading on bourses post the merger with HDFC Bank that came into effect on July 1. That marks the end of a four-decade-long journey for India’s oldest mortgage lender.  Founded by H T Parekh, uncle of Deepak Parekh, HDFC was incorporated on October 17, 1977, and disbursed its first home loan in 1978 to D. B. Remedios in Mumbai. To start with, the founding team had an unenviable job. Home loans were not a popular product back then and no one knew HDFC as a brand.  But the team worked hard and steadily expanded the business. By 1984, HDFC had crossed annual loan approvals of Rs 100 crore, a big milestone for the company. The company was listed in 1978 with a face value of Rs 100 each. The issue did not get a great response, in fact, it was undersubscribed.  Yet, that was the start of a remarkable journey to become a financial behemoth. On July 12, when the shares closed, HDFC had a market capitalisation of over Rs 5 lakh crore.  End of an era  Deepak Parekh, the man who played a key role in building India’s oldest mortgage lender from scratch, hung up his boots after four decades with the company. With Parekh stepping down from all roles, an era has ended.  In his last letter to shareholders of HDFC on June 30, Chairman Deepak Parekh announced his retirement ahead of the mega merger with HDFC Bank saying it is time for him to hang up his boots.  Parekh, 78, will not take up any role in the bank while HDFC Chief Executive Officer Keki Mistry is likely to join the bank's Board subject to clearance from the Reserve Bank of India.  &quot;It is my time to hang my boots with both anticipation and hope for the future,&quot; Parekh told shareholders.  &quot;While this will be my last communication to shareholders of HDFC, rest assured we now stride tall into a very exciting future of growth and prosperity,&quot; Parekh added. In a rather emotional letter, Parekh said the HDFC experience is invaluable. &quot;Our history cannot be erased and our legacy will be taken forward,&quot; said the veteran banker.  Questions on HDFC culture  In the letter, Parekh re-emphasised the importance of HDFC culture which helped the institution become a household name in India.  &quot;An oft-repeated question is what happens to the culture of HDFC? My answer to this is that mergers are inherently about change. The work culture will be an amalgamation of the best of both organisations,&quot; Parekh wrote.  Explaining further, Parekh said the culture at the workplace is always a shared responsibility that needs daily reinforcement through the demonstration effect with the tone set at the top.  &quot;As HDFC hands the baton, my wish is that our core founding values of kindness, fairness, efficiency and effectiveness get woven deeper into the fabric of the HDFC group,&quot; Parekh added.  In the letter, Parekh said HDFC Bank managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan and his team at the bank will take the HDFC legacy ahead.  &quot;With the proven execution capabilities of HDFC Bank, we are confident that Sashi, together with the leadership team will forge an era of new opportunities for the combined entity,&quot; Parekh wrote in the letter.  Message to the bank?  In what appeared like a message or guidance to the bank with respect to home loan business, Parekh said that every home loan customer has their own story and it is the empathy factor that is the key differentiator between housing finance providers.  &quot;Dealing with home loan customers requires immense patience. It is about understanding the needs and feelings of a home loan customer, assuaging their anxiety during this complex transaction, customising solutions, explaining financial implications of a mortgage product and lending responsibly to ensure a customer is not over-stretched,&quot; the veteran banker said.  Only home loan provider in the 80s  For CEO Keki Mistry too, this is the end of a long journey as HDFC CEO. In an interview with Moneycontrol in March this year, Mistry, who is associated with the HDFC brand for nearly 42 years, also highlighted that there will be structural opportunities in housing finance as the sector has seen tremendous change.  “In the early 1980s, we were the only housing loan provider. Convincing people in the 80s that housing finance and loan would work was a major challenge. But now the sustained demand for housing loans has been strong,” Mistry said.  Though the merger was discussed a few years ago, the plan entered a fast track in May 2021 with the bank deliberating the proposal at the top level and later approaching the parent with a proposal. HDFC Bank insiders say that compared with the previous boss of the bank, Aditya Puri, his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan was more amenable to the idea of a merger. Puri exited the bank in October 2020 and Jagdishan took charge as the new chief.  A good match for both parties  While the merger gave the much-need big entry to the bank into the lucrative home loan business, for the parent too, the decision made immense sense for one key reason. For NBFCs, life was getting tougher in India.  In his first-ever exclusive media interview post the merger announcement, Deepak Parekh told Moneycontrol that the NBFC business was getting tougher due to the tightening of the RBI regulations. “The constraint is that the RBI, over the last few years, removed the arbitrage between a bank and an NBFC,” he said.  Over the years, the RBI had brought in bank-like regulations for India’s big non-banks. Under the new multi-tiered structure for NBFCs (based on their asset size and systemic importance), bigger NBFCs were treated at par with banks on capital, regulatory scrutiny, and treatment of assets, which made operations even more expensive for this class of companies.  HDFC, with an over Rs 5-lakh-crore loan book, logically fell in the upper layer which meant it will be now monitored, inspected and regulated akin to a bank, whereas the incentives in NBFC business were less. However, when HDFC knocked on the doors of the regulator for a merger, it got a key relief.  The RBI gave critical relaxations on certain aspects such as priority sector lending norms and treatment of ownership of subsidiaries in April 21, 2023. Also, the RBI gave six months to HDFC customers to switch to new benchmarks.  Post-merger, the loan book of the merged entity will jump to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as on March 31, 2023, while deposits are at Rs 18.84 lakh crore. Further, HDFC Bank's market capitalisation will rise to Rs 14.6 lakh crore, from Rs 9.45 lakh crore prior to the merger. For the HDFC group, a great story ends and a new journey begins today.

The franchise has always been ahead of its peers not only in terms of smoothly navigating the tough economic cycles but also in sustaining superior profitable growth along with pristine asset quality across cycles and its track record is unmatched across the sector. Customer acquisition, higher productivity gains led by improvement in the vintage of branches, sustained cost reduction driven by accelerated investments in technology, and cross-selling of wider product suites are the key drivers for sustainable growth over the medium term.

The bank, Chakraborty said in an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18 after its merger with HDFC Ltd., will bring in healthy net interest margins (NIM) and offer customers of HDFC Ltd. products like insurances, personal loans etc. at competitive rates through its large network.  “The bank will grow steadily across housing, micro small and medium enterprises (MSME), corporate and retail and priority sector lending segments. We will be able to provide funds at a cheaper rate to customers,” said Chakraborty.  On priority sector lending, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed the bank to meet priority sector lending requirements after the merger with HDFC in a gradual manner, up to three years.  “There is a standard stipulation for every bank and these were not there for HDFC Ltd. We will be able to meet the target on the basis of the roadmap provided by the RBI,” Chakraborty said.

On this, Chakraborty said: “There is a need to be mindful of lack of growth and sticky core inflation globally.”  He also highlighted that currently, the mortgage market only forms 11 percent of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) whereas that of China and other south-asian countries is higher.  “India is a very underpenetrated market. But we see the demand only going up as the overall growth of the country is going up.  We only see opportunity in the market for everyone and no competition. We also see that the bank will be able to provide competitive rates for home buyers,” said Chakraborty.

As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.  In fact, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC Ltd, had said, back in 2015 itself, that his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank, if circumstances were favourable. But the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense, provided there is no loss for shareholders.  Once the deal comes into force, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank.

Shah recalled that in May 1987, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC, came to Cross Maidan to motivate the HDFC Cricket team during the finals of the Corporate Cricket tournament ‘The Times Shield.’  &quot;He took me for a stroll on the ground as it was a lunch break to discuss the status of the match which he responded HDFC will win. He wanted to know if we needed to strengthen the team to meet the challenges of a higher level and he stuck to his commitment of a spinner being recruited,&quot; said Shah.  The evolution  HDFC Bank was incorporated in 1994 as a banking subsidiary of HDFC in Mumbai. With time, HDFC and HDFC Bank became mammoths in their respective sectors. The bank’s loan book, over the years, grew tremendously from Rs 2.3 lakh crore in 2013 to Rs 16 lakh crore in 2023. As of March 2023, the market capitalisation of HDFC Bank is Rs 9.5 lakh crore and that of HDFC is Rs 5.2 lakh crore.  The struggle of selling a home loan was something that HDFC faced in the years of its evolution. Parekh, in a press conference in Mumbai, on June 27, said that he still remembers the first loan the company gave. &quot;Our first home loan was of Rs 30,000. We took photographs of the customer with his house and made it the cover picture of our first annual report,&quot; said Parekh.  Shah recalled that during his time in HDFC, he remembered the growth of the company and summed it up in one word — commitment. &quot;The management of the company created an environment of subtleness and friendliness from the earliest days,&quot; said Shah.  Also read: With Rs 14.7-lakh-cr MCap, HDFC-HDFC Bank united to outgrow top 4 private, 13 PSU lenders  Culture of HDFC  Parekh said HDFC and HDFC Bank have different cultures due to the nature of their business. However, though there is some difference, the company aims to have the same culture in the bank, he added. &quot;We want to have the culture of HDFC in HDFC Bank. Culture is the essential part of our organisation. A bank which does not do housing will have a different culture,&quot; said Parekh.  Mistry also said that there is not much cultural difference in HDFC and HDFC Bank and that every single employee from the mortgage lender will get absorbed into the bank. &quot;We don't see too many cultural differences between the two entities and all our staff. We have reassured that every single employee of HDFC will be taken into the bank,&quot; said Mistry.  Also read: HDFC-HDFC Bank merger: How did the story unfold over time?  The employee, who did not wish to be named, highlighted that the culture at HDFC is one thing he takes pride in. &quot;Culture is the essence of a workplace. I felt a home-like culture at HDFC,&quot; said the employee.  The merger  HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge on April 4, 2022. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.  In fact, Parekh had said, back in 2015 itself, that his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank, if circumstances were favourable. But the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense, provided there is no loss for shareholders.  Sashidhar Jagdishan, Managing Director, HDFC Bank, on an analyst call on May 24, said that the merger is only about a month away.  Once the deal comes into force, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank. With the parent finally joining with the bank, the combined entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-hdfc-bank-merger-as-an-era-comes-to-end-senior-hdfc-employees-walk-down-memory-lane-10893631.html
HDFC,2023-07-01T18:45:48+05:30,PTI,Aim to double every four years: HDFC Bank MD Sashidhar Jagdishan after merger,"To realise its growth aims, Jagdishan said the bank will be adding about 1,500 branches every year for some years to better serve the middle class and upper segment of the country.","Having successfully executed the merger with parent HDFC, HDFC Bank's managing director and chief executive Sashidhar Jagdishan on Saturday said the country's largest lender aims to double every four years.  In a letter to the over 4,000 employees from HDFC who joined the bank's rolls on Saturday, Jagdishan said the future is bright, and the work on realising the potential of the merger starts now.  &quot;The runway for financial services and mortgage, which are so underserved and under penetrated, is going to be very large. HDFC Bank - the combined entity - with a large and growing distribution and customer franchise, more than adequate capital, healthy asset quality and profitability, will be best positioned to capture growth. The pace at which we aim to grow - we could be creating a new HDFC Bank every 4 years,&quot; he said.  HDFC Bank began the day one after the merger with a rebranding exercise, wherein it is putting up its colours at all the over 500 branches and offices of HDFC Ltd.  The erstwhile HDFC's corporate headquarters at Ramon House already sports the HDFC Bank branding, and officials estimated that the entire exercise will be over in the next 24 hours.  It can be noted that dedicated teams have been put in place to make the merger as seamless as possible, right since its announcement on April 4 last year. As part of the USD 40 billion all-share deal, the biggest in Indian corporate history, HDFC Bank had committed to absorb all the over 4,000 employees of its parent.  &quot;Our work starts from today, in realising the potential of what this merger holds for us,&quot; Jagdishan wrote.  To realise its growth aims, Jagdishan said the bank will be adding about 1,500 branches every year for some years to better serve the middle class and upper segment of the country.  It will continue investments on the digital front as well which, Jagdishan said, will make HDFC Bank into a 'technology company into banking&quot;, and added that the same will get unveiled over the next three years.  The bank will be assessing its people on the basis of how they conduct governance and compliance, teamwork and their ability to delight customers, he said.  The canvas being offered to the HDFC Ltd employees is large -- both professionally and personally, the email said, adding that an external expert was appointed to arrive at the right formula for inducting people into the bank and deciding their role in the hierarchy.  Jagdishan said the cost-to-revenue ratio of HDFC at 0.04 per cent was the lowest for any mortgage company in the world, and thanked its leadership, including Deepak Parekh, Keki Mistry and Renu Karnad, for creating such an institution.  He said from a customer perspective, the home loan is a very emotional product which establishes a great bond between the financier and borrower and added that HDFC Bank would like to harness the same bond.  &quot;The penetration levels of the home loan product in its (HDFC Bank's) customer base and the extent the distribution has been leveraged, is quite low. This is an opportunity! The runway for growth is going to be large and for a long time to come,&quot; Jagdishan said.  HDFC Bank will move from sales management to a relationship management model because of the opportunity to cross-sell that exists within the franchise after the addition of mortgage finance, insurance and asset management subsidiaries, Jagdishan said.  &quot;The velocity of product sales and the reduced touch points to serve the customer will be a game changer with this 'power of bundling',&quot; he added.  HDFC Ltd, the parent of the country's largest private sector lender, merged into HDFC Bank on Saturday, with boards of both entities clearing the plan first presented on April 4 last year. HDFC Ltd, the largest pure-play home financier, ceases to exist 44 years after it was founded.  The USD 40-billion merger, the largest such deal in Indian corporate history, is driven by a changing regulatory landscape, which limited the advantages for HDFC continuing as a non-bank lending entity.  Post-merger, HDFC Bank will become the fourth most valued lender in the world, and narrow the gap by asset size with state-owned SBI to be the second largest Indian bank.  The total business of the merged entity stood at Rs 41 lakh crore at the end of March 2023. With the merger, the networth of the entity would be over Rs 4.14 lakh crore.  The combined profit of both entities was to the tune of about Rs 60,000 crore at the end of March 2023.  With the deal getting effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 per cent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 per cent of the bank. Every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares they hold.  The board of directors of HDFC Bank in consultation with the board of directors of HDFC Limited has fixed July 13, 2023, for determining the shareholders of HDFC Ltd who would be issued and allotted the shares of HDFC Bank, it added.  Besides, July 13 has been fixed for the continuation of warrants of HDFC Limited in the name of HDFC Bank.  The board has fixed July 12, 2023, for the transfer of non-convertible debentures while July 7 for the transfer of commercial papers of HDFC Ltd in the name of HDFC Bank.

This will be done seamlessly on their digitalisation platforms – all through a one-click experience,&quot; the HDFC chairman said in the letter.  HDFC and HDFC bank merger is likely to take effect from July 1.

Focus on HDFC Culture  In the letter, Parekh reemphasised the importance of HDFC culture that has helped the institution become a household name in India.  &quot;An oft-repeated question is what happens to the culture of HDFC? My answer to this is that mergers are inherently about change. The work culture will be an amalgamation of the best of both organisations,&quot; Parekh wrote.  Explaining further, Parekh said culture at the workplace is always a shared responsibility that needs daily reinforcement through the demonstration effect with the tone set at the top.  &quot;As HDFC hands the baton, my wish is that our core founding values of kindness, fairness, efficiency and effectiveness get woven deeper into the fabric of the HDFC group,&quot; Parekh added.  In the letter, Parekh said HDFC Bank managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan and his team at the bank will take the HDFC legacy ahead.  &quot;With the proven execution capabilities of HDFC Bank, we are confident that Sashi, together with the leadership team will forge an era of new opportunities for the combined entity,&quot; Parekh wrote in the letter.

Further, working towards the common goal of executing the merger has helped both sides get to know each other better, the veteran banker said.  &quot;It has been a phase of working jointly to tackle issues on hand, but more importantly, it has enabled HDFC Bank to have a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics of the home loan business,&quot; Parekh added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/deepak-parekh-to-shareholders-home-loan-customers-to-offer-cross-selling-opportunities-to-hdfc-bank-10883791.html

The company has told exchanges that it received a Goods and Services Tax (GST) demand notice of Rs 942 crore for the period between July 2017 and March 2022.  The private sector life insurer had on June 23 informed the bourses that it received a show-cause-cum-demand notice from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, Mumbai Zonal Unit. The GST office asked the company “why a tax of Rs 942,18,46,028 pertaining to the period July 2017 to FY22, should not be demanded from the company&quot;, the filing said.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  The matter is related to claims of an input tax credit against the supply of services, which the authority believes are ineligible. The company has been advised by its legal and tax counsel that it has a good contestable case, it said.  &quot;This is an industry-wide issue and the company will be taking appropriate steps in due course to reply to the show-cause notice and contest the matter. It may be noted that Rs 250 crore has been deposited under protest with the authority in this matter in the past,&quot; HDFC Life added.

DGGI investigations revealed that these insurers were paying commissions beyond the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s permissible limit to their corporate agents in the garb of expenses related to marketing and brand activation.  The GST law doesn’t allow availing of such input tax credit as the supply of said service did not actually take place.

HDFC,2023-06-23T11:47:13+05:30,Anand J,"Apple taps HDFC Bank to launch credit card, in talks with NPCI for Apple Pay","This comes in the wake of Apple's decision to stop card payments in India on its App Store and for its iCloud services. The credit card could also see significant changes from the US model, where Apple takes control of the business. In India, banks control the credit card issuance and run the business.","iPhone maker Apple is in talks with banks and regulators to launch its credit card, dubbed &quot;Apple Card,&quot; in India. The company's CEO, Tim Cook, met with HDFC Bank CEO and MD Sashidhar Jagdishan during his trip to India in April, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  The technology giant is also holding discussions with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to possibly launch Apple Pay in the country, a third source told Moneycontrol. It is not clear whether these discussions are regarding its credit card being powered by NPCI's Rupay platform or whether this is for Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The advantage of launching a Rupay Credit Card is that it can be linked to UPI as well. In India, only banks are allowed to launch credit cards. UPI allows customers to make seamless and fast payments by scanning QR codes through mobile phones.  This comes at a time when a significant number of payments are being increasingly made through mobile phones. Technology giants such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung are actively pursuing expansion into the payments sector and have ambitious plans in the financial services space. These companies have developed payment apps and are looking to make significant strides in this area.  The Cupertino-based tech giant had also held discussions with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the modalities of the card, Moneycontrol has learned. According to one of the sources mentioned above, the regulator has asked Apple to follow the regular procedure for co-branded credit cards, without offering any special consideration for the company.  Both Apple and HDFC Bank did not offer any statements to the email queries sent to them. The RBI also did not respond to an email inquiry about whether the regulator had held discussions with Apple. NPCI did not respond to text messages sent by Moneycontrol.  According to the sources, Apple is looking to launch its Apple Card, a co-branded credit card with HDFC Bank in the country. The discussions are in the early stages and a decision has not been arrived at, the sources added. The nature of the discussion, as well as when Apple intends to launch this in India, could not be determined.  Apple was looking at significant deviations from the standard co-branded credit card model in India, one of the sources said. It is not clear whether the company is willing to make those compromises in order to launch the card in India, the source added.  Moneycontrol was unable to ascertain whether the discussions with the regulator took place through Apple executives or its potential banking partner.  Apple currently operates a premium credit card in the US, which was launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard. This card is made of titanium metal and is positioned as a high-end offering.  &quot;Apple works only with the biggest and the best and hence the discussions with HDFC Bank. While a lot goes into building partnerships, banks and other brands would be willing to sweeten the deal terms to get Apple on board,&quot; said one of the sources mentioned above.  Why India?  India has been a focus country for Apple for the last couple of years, with iPhone sales growing at a rapid pace, albeit from a low base. Apple's revenue in India touched around Rs 50,000 crore or $6 billion in FY23, representing a 50% growth over Rs 33,500 crore (around $4 billion) in FY22. Apple's global services revenue stands at around $80 billion. Converting a significant portion of these transactions through the Apple Card would have a substantial impact.  During Cook's visit to India in April, the company launched exclusive retail stores in Delhi and Mumbai. Additionally, the company has been shifting a significant portion of its iPhone production to India and the country could see almost 25% of Apple’s total mobile phone production in the next three to four years.  Apple currently holds approximately 4% of the overall smartphone market in India, which accounts for roughly two crore users.  If 20-30 percent of Indian smartphone users switch to iPhone over the next decade, as is the case in other middle-income countries, India could become Apple's third-largest market, after the US and China.  However, what might have prompted Apple to consider launching the Apple Card in India before Japan or other European countries is the fact that Apple does not currently accept card payments in India. In India, UPI powers most App Store purchases, apart from iCloud services such as storage and music.  This was after the RBI said that third-party websites should not store card details on their platforms, but only in a tokenised form. The regulator also insisted that all the payment data should be stored only on Indian servers. Another card-related direction was to take one-time customer permission through OTP for standing instructions meant that UPI was more seamless for Apple customers.  &quot;Apple is cagey about several of these directions. Hence the company decided to stop card payments in India temporarily. It makes sense for the company to explore launching its own credit card before it restarts card payments in India thus preempting other credit cards being used on the platform,&quot; one of the sources mentioned above said. The Apple website still mentions only Apple Account Balance, net banking, and UPI as the approved payment methods on the platform.  Is Apple ready for compromises?  Unlike in the US, Apple cannot bring a plain card with just Apple's logo and the customer's name on the front. The regulations will require that Apple takes the back seat and the bank will take the driver's seat. The Goldman Sachs name and Mastercard also appear on the backside of the Apple Card in the US. The card also does not have any card number printed on it. These are not liberties that Apple can take in India as per the current co-branded credit card regulations in India.  Last year, the RBI clearly stated that the bank's partner cannot store customer data or transaction data. Even the Apple Card details cannot be stored on Apple platforms, which is not the case in other countries that Apple operates.  &quot;To get all the premium Apple customers on board for their credit card is a great proposition for the banks, but none of them can offer any substantial privileges as the regulations around this is strict,” one of the sources mentioned above said.  What Apple Card brings to the customers?  The Apple Card is integrated with Apple Pay, and the reward money is deposited into Apple wallet and earns an annual interest rate of 4.15 percent.  The Apple Card also does not have any annual fees. In the US, Apple let its card users buy Apple products in installments without any interest. Apart from around 3-5 percent cashback on purchasing Apple products and Apple services, the company could tie up with other premium brands to offer 2-3 percent cashback or reward points on purchases from these partners.  In the US, Apple also provides a daily 2 percent cashback while using the card through Apple Watch or iPhone. This is by adding the credit card to Apple Pay and the payment is done using tap and pay at NFC (near field communication) -enabled payment terminals. The company also provide 3 percent cashback at major merchants.

Here’s what it came up with,"&quot;As an AI language model, I am not authorized to provide financial advice. That said, some popular stocks that may be worth considering are…","“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” – Arthur C Clarke (1962)  In the heady days before the advent of computers, young, wide-eyed traders beginning their careers at some of London’s famed stockbroking establishments were given a large blue book and calculator on their first day at work.  But, if the hapless youngsters were caught using the calculator, the blue book would be hurled at them with great force by hardened veteran traders manning the floors.  The lesson? Be razor-sharp with numbers, develop the “trader’s instinct” and don’t depend on a puny device if you want to make it big in the business.  Alas, these admirable attributes declined the introduction of computerised trading. Suddenly, a computer terminal was able to parse reams of data and execute millions of trades before a stockbroker could even shout &quot;buy General Electric&quot;.  Not just the calculator and blue book, computers made even humans obsolete on the trading floor.  A similar, if not bigger, seismic shift may be underway, at least for retail investors, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI).  Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, Dall-E, Midjourney and various others are hogging the limelight with a smorgasbord of innovative applications, inspiring awe and fear in equal measure.  Some early adopters and researchers are also using AI platforms to analyse news reports, US Fed announcements and stock exchange filings. The initial results have been more than encouraging.  But how does AI perform when it comes to stock-picking in the Indian context? And can investors repose faith this digital black box? We decided to dig deeper.  Abracadabra  For the past few weeks, we ran multiple prompts on ChatGPT to find out its top recommendations among Indian stocks. Both the free and paid versions of the OpenAI-developed chatbot were used.  Even though its training data is till September 2021, we figured it would be interesting to see what ChatGPT thinks is worth buying on Dalal Street. And of course, it's not as if the Indian corporate landscape has changed dramatically from end-2021.  However, direct queries on which stocks one should invest in were invariably brushed aside with this anodyne response:    So we decided to get creative with the prompts. In one query, for instance, we asked ChatGPT to imagine it was a world-renowned money manager and at a conference in Mumbai, an audience member posed a question on the best stocks available in India.  Another prompt was:    Much like a genuine conversationalist, ChatGPT perked up in response and began to spew out names (albeit with the usual disclaimers).    It made its preference clear over multiple iterations. Bluechip names like Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank and Infosys.  The paid version of the chatbot, which has been trained on more parameters than the free-to-use option, too preferred to stick with the market leaders.    Nothing too adventurous. Just limit your exposure to traditional market leaders like TCS, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank HUL, ITC and others.  Often, the answers veered from specifics to platitudinous advice on how to excel at the hazardous art (and science) of stock-picking.    Understand the market trends, consider the financial health of the company, assess its management track record and gauge its ability to adapt to changing conditions. Nothing terribly new, right?  On follow-up questions on which companies met these criteria, it reverted to its risk-averse stance:    In fact, such was ChatGPT’s bias towards the largecap universe that we began to wonder whether it was aware of any midcap or smallcap names in India at all.  So, the next queries were limited to smaller companies.  Here, however, it was a lot more difficult to get ChatGPT to recommend names, as it kept on listing general factors to consider while picking stocks.  Finally, after many attempts, it did offer some choices:    Behind the veil  Language processing AI models are trained on humongous amounts of text data scraped from the internet.  ChatGPT-3, for example, was trained on a whopping 570 GB of data, with 300 billion words being fed into its system. Its successor ChatGPT-4 is trained on even more data, though OpenAI has, so far, not revealed the specifics.  So when ChatGPT recommends bluechip stocks, does this mean it is just parroting the names most often mentioned in millions of webpages it has crawled?  Daniel Lemire, a leading voice on AI and a computer science professor at the Data Science Laboratory of the Université du Québec (TÉLUQ) in Montreal, said it is certainly possible.  “ChatGPT has not yet shown an ability to quickly adapt to fast-changing information. It makes sense that it would recommend large corporations that have a track record of profitability, but these recommendations could be misleading and potentially dangerous,” he told Moneycontrol.  Lemire, however, added that ChatGPT has shown that large language models (LLMs) have the ability for superior text comprehension.  “This means that it can be used to scour large volumes of text (press releases, annual reports, government announcements, etc) and even data (stock prices and so forth) to potentially identify quickly patterns faster than most human beings ever could. There are already software doing such processing (eg, doing sentiment analysis on text) but it has generally been much more superficial,” he noted.  Which means the tool can be of enormous importance to the common investor, at least for market research.  LLM industry veteran Matt Busigin, who is the co-founder and CTO of Ollie AI and was also an investment advisor in the US, said he uses ChatGPT for household budgeting, corporate budgeting, product management and other tasks.  GPT-4 can be deployed for analysis of data releases and, in particular, natural language such as Fed minutes to make much more rapid post-announcement trading decisions.  “This definitely had alpha through most of 2022 (I was paying attention to this), but using that as an edge will probably be eroded quickly in 2023, and it will result in less market volatility post-announcement or data-release, as the information will be more efficiently processed by the markets,” Busigin told Moneycontrol.  So what is the takeaway from this experiment? Should you use generative AI tools to pick stocks?  It is only appropriate that we let ChatGPT answer this one:  ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/we-asked-chatgpt-for-the-best-indian-stocks-heres-what-it-came-up-with-10807611.html
HDFC,2023-06-14T14:32:38+05:30,Reuters,Mutual funds may not get holdings waiver post HDFC Bank - HDFC merger: Report,HDFC Bank and HDFC - both heavily owned by mutual funds - are set to conclude a merger in the next few weeks to create India's second-largest financial institution by assets after the State Bank of India.,"India's markets regulator is unlikely to give special exemption to mutual funds if they breach the norms for maximum permitted holdings in a security after the merger of HDFC Bank and HDFC, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  HDFC Bank and HDFC - both heavily owned by mutual funds - are set to conclude a merger in the next few weeks to create India's second-largest financial institution by assets after the State Bank of India.  However, pressure on mutual funds to reduce their holdings or any limitations on increases could be an overhang on the stock of the merged entity.  As per the rules of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), a mutual fund scheme cannot invest more than 10% in a single security. However, exchange-traded funds and funds that invest in particular sectors are exempt.  At least 60 equity mutual fund schemes will see their combined exposure to HDFC Bank and HDFC overshoot the 10% cap as of Wednesday.  HDFC Bank and SEBI did not reply to emailed requests for comments.  SEBI could consider this overshoot as a &quot;passive breach,&quot; implying no deliberate attempt to flout rules, one of the sources said. In such cases, the funds have 30 days to rebalance their portfolio, which can be extended by another 60 days, failing which the mutual funds may face regulatory action, the source added.  Regulatory intervention is warranted if there is a wider impact on the market, which is not the case here, said the second source.  Both sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.  The matter has been referred to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), according to two mutual fund executives.  Last week, AMFI officials and industry executives analysed the impact of the merger and how much of the stock the industry would need to sell to adhere to regulatory limits, the executives said.  &quot;Considering the regulatory requirement, there will be some mutual funds that would need to sell which will create short-term pressure on the stock. However, with the prices reducing, it will create more opportunities for retail and other domestic investors to buy,&quot; said Deven Choksey, founder of KRChoksey Holdings Ltd, a brokerage firm.  Funds may have to offload 30 billion rupees ($364.9 million) to 40 billion rupees of the combined company's stock, said an executive with a large fund house.  &quot;HDFC Bank and HDFC are fairly liquid stocks and have a lot of demand. This will hold true for the combined entity, too,&quot; the executive said, adding that funds that need to sell will find buyers.  This clause could curtail the ability of fund managers to take incremental exposure to the banking bell-weather, the chief executive of another large-sized mutual fund pointed out.  &quot;Selling to meet the regulatory requirements could be seen by some in the market as a desperate act and the fund managers would not get good buyers at the right price,&quot; the person said. &quot;This will impact the fund's performance.&quot;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds-may-not-get-holdings-waiver-post-hdfc-bank-hdfc-merger-report-10796031.html
HDFC,2023-06-13T14:36:23+05:30,Bloomberg,"HDFC merger nears record date, creating world’s 5th most valuable bank","Announcement of the so called ‘record date’ — or the cut-off day set for investors — for the swapping of shares of Housing Development Finance Corp. for HDFC Bank Ltd. is expected within three weeks. The merged entity is likely to trade under the HDFC Bank ticker before July 20, bringing an end to the process that began in April 2022.","The merger of India’s most valuable lender and the nation’s largest mortgage financier to create what could be the world’s fifth-most valuable bank is inching closer to completion, with just one key step remaining that investors are watching for closely.  Announcement of the so called ‘record date’ — or the cut-off day set for investors — for the swapping of shares of Housing Development Finance Corp. for HDFC Bank Ltd. is expected within three weeks. The merged entity is likely to trade under the HDFC Bank ticker before July 20, bringing an end to the process that began in April 2022.  The merger is unprecedented in India, creating a bank worth $168 billion and impacting over tens of millions of customers and shareholders across the two companies apart from group insurance and asset management businesses.  A central team, with 3 members from each company, and nearly three dozen committees worked on a business integration plan. Meanwhile, legal approvals were sought from shareholders, banking, securities market and competition regulators as well as stock exchanges with the final nod granted by the company law tribunal in March.  The approvals got done in good time and the integration of technology platforms is at an advanced stage, Keki Mistry, chief executive officer of the mortgage lender told Bloomberg News last week. “The target is for the merger to be effective early July,” he said.  Final Step  Once the merger is effective, a cut-off date will be announced to determine HDFC shareholders eligible to receive HDFC Bank shares. HDFC shares will stop trading on that date and it would take a week or two for allocation and listing of new shares.  HDFC Bank will allocate 42 new shares for 25 shares of HDFC. The mortgage lender said it will try to time the record date to ensure no gap takes place between HDFC shares being suspended and HDFC Bank shares being allocated to its over 740,000 shareholders.  A day before the record date will be the ex-date which marks the price adjustment between the two merging companies, said Anil Ghelani, head of passive investments and products at DSP Asset Managers Ltd.  On the ex-date, the HDFC Bank share price will adjust to incorporate the value of HDFC. This is important for key stock indexes that include the two companies, as well as overlying index funds and ETFs.  Nifty Indices’ new rules indicate HDFC will be excluded from any index on the ex-date and the value of HDFC Bank updated. Earlier rules excluded companies from the index at the beginning of the merger process. This changed soon after the HDFC merger announcement as the two financial majors are among the top five constituents of the benchmark National Stock Exchange’s Nifty50 by weightage. The exchange did not respond to queries about the exclusion.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-merger-nears-record-date-creating-worlds-5th-most-valuable-bank-10789291.html
HDFC,2023-06-09T11:13:15+05:30,Reuters,HDFC Bank to keep home loans as focus of growth strategy post merger: Report,"The pace of growth in home loans will broadly mirror growth seen in HDFC's home loan portfolio, the first official said, declining to be identified as strategy discussions are not public.","India's HDFC Bank Ltd will keep home loans at the centre of its growth strategy after a merger with HDFC Ltd is concluded, with such credit likely to make up nearly a third of the bank's portfolio going forward, two senior officials at the group said.  The pace of growth in home loans will broadly mirror growth seen in HDFC's home loan portfolio, the first official said, declining to be identified as strategy discussions are not public.  Individual home loans have grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% over the last five years, according to its investor presentation.  The home loan segment is seen as a steady growth business with low delinquencies and has seen a boost since the pandemic.  While the share of portfolio will oscillate based on growth in other segments, the group is comfortable with it staying at current levels, the official said.  &quot;We see home loans as a secured sticky product which can generate sticky deposits and spur lending into a number of home-related personal loan categories,&quot; the official added.  The merger, announced in April last year and set to conclude in early July, will see India's largest housing financier merge with the bank it parented in 1994 - now the country's largest private lender.  Post the deal, HDFC's 7.2 trillion rupee ($87.32 billion) portfolio will be transferred to the bank and make up about 30% of its overall loan book. This includes individual housing loans worth 6.02 trillion rupees.  The housing loan business will not function as a separate vertical, but HDFC's front-line staff will continue to lead growth in that product, while expanding offerings to other retail loans as well, the second official said.  The first official added that credit decisions for home loans will roll into the bank's broader credit department.  RUSH OF DEALS  As part of the merger, HDFC's subsidiaries will be transferred to the bank.  HDFC Bank, whose second-largest segment is its banking business, will raise its stake in the life insurance business from 48.7% to over 50%, and from 49.9% to over 50% in the general insurance segment.  Both transactions will be concluded before the merger and could happen via the open market or through bilateral deals, the officials said.  The Reserve Bank of India has also asked HDFC to sell a majority stake in its education loan arm Credila Financial Services, valued at close to $1.2 billion-1.5 billion, due to an overlap with the bank's business.  While this transaction will not conclude before the merger, negotiations are at an advanced stage, the second person said.  HDB Financial, HDFC Bank's non-bank lending arm, will continue as a separate entity and move towards a listing before 2025, the first official said.  Post the merger, foreign shareholding in the combined entity is seen at about 60%-62%, the first person said.  This could allow the bank to be added into the MSCI index for the first time since 2013, potentially bringing in foreign inflows into the bank.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-bank-to-keep-home-loans-as-focus-of-growth-strategy-post-merger-report-10769601.html
HDFC,2023-06-08T16:29:05+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,"Analysts Call Tracker: Street laps up banking, finance firms in May, shuns IT",The IT pack had to bear the brunt of the Street’s ire as the slowdown in the West and banking crisis in the US led to a forgettable Q4 ,"After a stellar show in the final quarter of FY23, banking and finance companies emerged as the top picks of analysts in May, with heavyweights like SBI, HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank garnering zero &quot;sell&quot; calls.  In contrast, the information technology (IT) pack had to bear the brunt of the Street’s ire as the slowdown in the West and the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry – led to a forgettable quarter  Overall, companies with better earnings visibility scored over their counterparts mired in macro and operational challenges. A bird in hand proved better than two in the bush.  The 'buy' list  The two companies with the perfect optimism score — zero &quot;sell&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; calls — were SBI Life and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.    SBI Life Insurance Company declared a decent set of numbers in Q4. Net profit rose 15 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 777 crore, while net premium income climbed 14 percent to Rs 19,897 crore.  The gross written premium (GWP), a key metric to assess an insurance company's fiscal health, jumped 15 percent for FY23 to Rs 67,320 crore.  Analysts were heartened by the all-round improvement in operational metrics.  “The management is confident of delivering 20–25 percent business growth in FY24E on the back of healthy demand and improving penetration owing to regulatory changes. The diversified distribution channels are expected to contribute significantly to the overall growth of the company,” brokerage KRChoksey said in a note.  Also read: Q4 Results Scorecard: The agony and the ecstasy  The company has been maintaining its cost leadership among the private players over the past few years, despite an increase in operating costs led by increased spending on new initiatives, it added.  Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), too, posted strong quarterly numbers, with revenues soaring 40 percent to Rs 5,797 crore, supported by Haifa port consolidation.  “As APSEZ embarks on becoming India's largest integrated transport utility company by 2030, it is strengthening its capabilities in all logistics segments (ports, warehousing, last mile delivery, ICDs, etc). Hence, it will offer end-t- end service to its customers thereby capturing a higher wallet share and also making the cargo sticky in nature,” analysts at ICICI Direct said.  In tandem with other Adani group stocks, APSEZ has rebounded following the rout triggered by American short-seller Hindenburg Research’s report in late January. The report accused the port-to-power conglomerate of stock manipulation and other wrongdoings. The group has denied the charges.  APSEZ is up over 87 percent over its 52-week low of Rs 394.95 hit on February 3.  The other prominent names figuring on top of analysts’ buy lists include SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Axis Bank.  Banking and finance firms had a standout quarter, marked by robust disbursements despite rising rates, healthy interest margins and stable asset quality.  Public sector banks’ cumulative profit crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in the financial year 2023, with market leader SBI accounting for nearly half of the total earnings.  From posting a net loss of Rs 85,390 crore in 2017-18, PSBs have come a long way.  “The banking sector reported a strong 4Q FY23, driven by healthy loan growth, stable margins, and continued asset quality improvements. There were numerous drivers of credit expansion, with the retail and MSME sectors exhibiting robust growth and the corporate book displaying a healthy rebound,” brokerage Motilal Oswal said.  Declining fortunes    JSW Steel topped the pessimism list with 17 &quot;sell&quot;, nine &quot;hold&quot; and just six &quot;buy&quot; calls.  Its Q4 performance was mixed -- consolidated net profit rose 13 percent to Rs 3,664 crore, even as revenue from operations stayed flat at Rs 46,962 crore.  The company also said it recorded higher-ever crude steel production as well as saleable steel sales during the quarter.  The narrative around the metal space has turned negative, given that China's demand has not really come up despite its post-Covid reopening, while recession fears in the West are further weighing on outlook.  “Though global steel consumption is facing headwinds due to inflationary pressures, high interest rate pressures, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a slowdown in China, steel demand is robust in the domestic market,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.  Also read: Head-to-head: TCS trounces Infosys on all fronts of financials  Some of the most prominent names on this list, however, are IT companies.  India’s IT giants have been clobbered by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West.  “We remain underweight on IT as a sector. The macro overhang witnessed post the unfolding of regional bank issues in the US and EU impacted the growth and margin exit rates in March 2023. The companies which reported March 2023 results… expect some spillover of this weakness into the June 2023 quarter as well,” said Shibani Sircar Kurian, Senior EVP &amp;amp; Head-Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.  Initial expectations of margin improvement have been kept under check on account of negative operating leverage, given the sudden ramp-downs the sector had seen.  “Overall, we expect the operating environment over the next two quarters to remain challenging due to the macro issues and cautious stance of companies on discretionary spends,” she added.  Pharma and auto companies, too, attracted a raft of &quot;sell&quot; and &quot;hold&quot; calls due to factors like revenue collapse post-Covid, negative consumer sentiment due to elevated inflation and demand headwinds.  Also read: Next 2 quarters likely to be challenging for IT sector, says Shibani Kurian of Kotak Mahindra AMC  Road ahead  Analysts say the bulk of Nifty’s earnings growth in FY24 is expected to come from sectors linked to investment and domestic consumption.  “Nifty ended FY23 with an 11% EPS growth on a high base of 34% growth in FY22. Earnings though remain lopsided with BFSI driving almost entire incremental earnings in FY23. With healthy macros, range-bound oil prices, a robust fiscal balance sheets, and moderating inflation, the backdrop for the market is quite optimistic,” Motilal Oswal said.

HDFC,2023-06-08T12:49:40+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Here are 10 hot stocks to bet on as RBI keeps policy rates unchanged,"The market seems to have reacted to the MPC move as the benchmark indices rallied sharply in the previous session to hit the highest level of current calendar year. Today, the Nifty and Sensex turned volatile","The Monetary Policy Committee has maintained the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in its bi-monthly review, while continuing to keep a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook.  Five of the six-member committee voted in favour of maintaining withdrawal of accommodation stance to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.  The interest rate decision by MPC is on expected lines, though few experts were expecting a possibility of change in policy stance to neutral.  The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures.  Headline inflation is projected to decline in 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23 but would still be above the target, warranting continuous vigil, said the RBI, adding the progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard.  The central bank lowered its FY24 inflation projection to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent earlier, and also to 4.6 percent from 5.1 percent for Q1FY24 and to 5.2 percent against 5.4 percent for Q2FY24.  &quot;As the RBI expects inflation to remain within its target range for the rest of the fiscal year, and with growth faring reasonably well, we think the RBI will stay on hold through the rest of FY24,&quot; Rahul Bajoria, MD and Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics at Barclays, said.  RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his policy address emphasised the need to bring down the CPI inflation to its 4 percent target consistently, saying that inflation being within the tolerance band itself was “not good enough”, Rahul pointed out.  The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months, the RBI said.  Also read: Market in see-saw mode post-RBI policy, here are the key factors at play  The central bank has maintained its current financial year growth projection at 6.5 percent, while expecting the real GDP growth for Q1FY24 at 8 percent and 6.5 percent for Q2FY24.  The market seems to have already reacted to the MPC move as the benchmark indices rallied sharply in previous session to hit the highest level of current calendar year.

In brief, the stock is in the long-term breakout mode and we can expect a minimum of Rs 520 and a maximum of Rs 650 in the long run, which is its 50 percent retracement resistance of the entire fall. Buy in 2 parts, with a stop-loss at Rs 445.    Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 315 | Stop-Loss: Rs 295 | Target: Rs 330-350 | Return: 11 percent  The stock is forming a triangle formation, which is a continuation formation for the prevailing trend, which is bullish and upward.  Technically, we can expect Rs 330 and Rs 350 in the near term. Buy 50 percent at the current levels and the balance at Rs 305 which is the lower boundary of the triangle. For the same, one can keep a stop-loss at Rs 295.  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,607.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,570 | Target: Rs 1,680-1,700 | Return: 6 percent  Currently, the stock is available at a major support zone, which is between Rs 1,600 and Rs 1,575. The 200-day EMA is also at Rs 1,584, which would offer significant support to the stock if it corrects.  On the higher side, the resistance is in the range of Rs 1,680-1,700 levels, which is a decent upside with a medium-term view. It’s a buy at current levels and more on dips with a stop-loss at Rs 1,570.

HDFC,2023-06-07T12:07:39+05:30,Jinit Parmar,"Exclusive| HDFC's 90% of short-term loans to corporates, realtors matured ahead of merger","As per Reserve Bank of India rules, these loans are not allowed for banks. Hence, HDFC Bank, in June 2022, asked its parent company to cut exposure to these loans.","Mortgage lending major Housing Development Finance Corporation's  (HDFC) 90 percent of short-term loans extended to certain corporations and real estate dealers have matured ahead of the merger with HDFC Bank as these loans are not permissible under the banking business rules of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said a person aware of the development.  HDFC is set to merge with HDFC Bank by July-August 2023, and the merged entity will be known as HDFC Bank.  The RBI has, however, allowed HDFC to carry forward some of these short-term loans to HDFC Bank, after the merger process.  What does this mean?  Out of HDFC Ltd’s total short-term loans worth around Rs 10,000 crore, largely given to corporates and real-estate dealers, 10 percent or Rs 1,000 crore, will be allowed to be passed on to HDFC Bank, sources said.   Also read: HDFC Bank asks parent to cut exposure to certain loans before merger  “Around 90 percent or Rs 9,000 crore worth of our short-term loans have matured and the rest, of approximately Rs 1,000 crore, will be carried forward after our merger with HDFC Bank,” said a person aware of the development.  “These loans will mature in some time after our merger with HDFC Bank and the size of the portfolio is very small. Hence, the central bank has allowed us to keep those loans,” the person added.  Emails to the bank and the RBI seeking response to this report remained unanswered till the time of filing this copy.  Also read: HDFC to complete its merger with HDFC Bank by July  On June 9, 2022, Moneycontrol was the first to report that HDFC Bank is said to have asked its parent to cut exposure to a certain category of loans that are not permitted for banks under the RBI regulations.  The mega merger  HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge on April 4, 2022. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.  In fact, back in 2015, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC Ltd, said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank, if circumstances were favourable. But the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense, provided there is no loss of value for shareholders.  Also read: HDFC Bank to take No. 1 slot in home loan market after HDFC merger  Sashidhar Jagdishan, Managing Director, HDFC Bank, on an analyst call on May 24 said that the merger is only about a month away.  “It's now just another four or five weeks before the big day that is going to be happening,” Jagdishan said.  On March 10, in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, HDFC Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Keki Mistry said that the merger will lead to bigger growth opportunities for the combined entity.  “Gradually, the objective is to expand housing loans from more and more branches of the bank. The growth opportunity on housing loans will be bigger in HDFC Bank (the combined entity) than HDFC,” said Mistry.  Once the deal comes into force, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank.  With the parent finally joining up with the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-hdfc-pares-down-90-of-short-term-loans-to-corporates-realtors-ahead-of-merger-10756701.html

HDFC,2023-06-06T17:45:23+05:30,Harsh Kumar,"HDFC Bank’s suspension of manager highlights pressure to meet sales targets, say experts",The bank acted after a video of the official’s unruly behaviour during a conference call with team members was shared widely on social media.,"HDFC Bank’s suspension of a manager for alleged unruly behaviour with junior team members during a sales conference call is symptomatic of the larger issue of pressure to sell third-party financial products, experts said.  A video circulating on Twitter showed the manager shouting at his junior colleagues for not selling enough banking and financial products.  “This bears reference to a recent social media report. Basis a preliminary enquiry in the matter, the concerned employee has been suspended and a detailed investigation has been initiated which will be undertaken as per conduct guidelines of the Bank,&quot; HDFC Bank said in a statement made available to Moneycontrol on June 6.  The bank said it has zero tolerance for any form of misconduct at the workplace and believes in treating all employees with dignity and respect.  Deeper problem  Bankers told Moneycontrol that the incident highlighted a deeper problem: the pressure to sell third-party products such as insurance policies.  “Bankers are under lots of pressure, not only in the private sector but also in the government sector, to sell third-party products,” said a banker who did not wish to be identified.  This was one reason for the mis-selling or forced selling of financial products, the bankers said.  “We are forced to sell insurance products. Even though we are bankers, we have become agents of insurance companies,” said a manager-level employee of Bank of Baroda on condition of anonymity.  “In the last 1-2 years, core banking work has been disturbed badly as our workforce was involved more in selling insurance products,” an official said.  Gaurang Shah of Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol that ethics should be maintained above everything else. He said companies must train their employees on compliance and ethics. There are targets in all fields and for that you need team-driven qualities. One cannot use unparliamentary language or behave rudely, said Shah.  Ashwin Parekh, MD of Ashwin Parekh Consultancy, said the aggressive approach to selling insurance products is not limited to banks.  “It is also with insurance companies' agents,” said Parekh.  Not only private banks  The pressure to sell third-party products is not restricted to private banks.  In February, Moneycontrol reported that state-run bankers faced immense pressure from the top management to sell third-party products like insurance. Failure to meet targets invites informal penal actions, while meeting targets brings perks such as parties in five-star resorts, bankers told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.  Banks typically cross-sell the insurance products of their subsidiaries, and sometimes of other companies, along with loan products. Many times banks insist on the purchase of policies along with loan products.  While this has been the case for long, of late, the pressure has grown manifold on mid-level bank executives who typically do not speak in the open, fearing the wrath of senior colleagues, said bank executives.  RBI caution  On June 5, an expert panel appointed by the Reserve Bank of India under the chairmanship of former deputy governor BP Kanungo proposed a list of recommendations to improve customer service standards in regulated entities.  The proposals include reviewing charges levied by entities and extending deposit insurance cover to bank prepaid instruments and later to non-bank prepaid instruments.  It said cross-selling of third-party products should be subject to verification by the audit function to ensure there was no mis-selling and all instructions and guidelines with respect to the sale of such products are followed.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/hdfc-banks-suspension-of-manager-highlights-pressure-to-meet-sales-targets-say-experts-10752851.html
HDFC,2023-06-06T11:07:56+05:30,TN Hari, TN Hari On Viral HDFC Bank Video: Companies must pay greater attention to reference checks and causes of...,"The viral video has blown up on the company’s face. Creating a good work culture is time consuming but a few wrong hires are all that’s needed to destroy it. High growth expectations lead to excessive prioritising of short-term outcomes, and leaders turn a blind eye to behaviours that create long-term damage","A recent video of an abusive manager at HDFC Bank who is seen humiliating his team members on a conference call went viral.  During the entire meeting one can see the manager using abusive language to push his team members to achieve a certain set of business targets. Whether the targets were realistic or not is neither evident nor the point. The standard statement that follows an expose like this was quickly issued by the bank: “We at HDFC Bank have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of misconduct at the workplace and firmly believe in treating all our employees with dignity and respect,” This incident should not be viewed as an isolated case of one manic manager gone berserk and forgotten. This is symptomatic of deeper challenges that need to be understood and addressed. And these challenges are not unique to HDFC Bank. Such incidents are not as rare as one may imagine. At BigBasket we had a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment and had gone to great lengths to communicate and enforce this policy. The company’s reputation for maintaining a healthy and harassment-free workplace was kind of legendary and common industry knowledge. Decency, Decorum And Workplaces  Yet, what was surprising was that though everyone knew how uncompromising the company was in dealing with such cases, such incidents never completely disappeared. From time to time, although very infrequently, there were one-off complaints around sexual harassment. There was also a period of time when almost all complaints and escalations relating to toxic work culture emanated predominantly from just one of the eight regions. Something seemed to have gone terribly wrong with that region. The point here is that isolated incidents are not an anomaly even in companies like BigBasket where good intent was backed up by strong preventive and swift investigative mechanisms. And this is a pattern I've noticed time and again in all the five high growth startups I have been a part of. One of the consequences of high growth is the difficulty in inculcating and enforcing decency and decorum across the length and breadth of the company, especially if the geographic spread of the company is large. The more unrealistic the growth targets, the more acute the challenge. The situation is compounded multifold if the apex leadership team of the company themselves succumb to the temptation of driving short term outcomes by indulging in, and sometimes even encouraging, a toxic work culture and stop treating those around them with dignity and respect. If this happens, then the implosion is quite rapid, and there are many examples of this both in the Indian as well as global contexts. Uber went through an upheaval after Susan Fowler exposed the toxic bro-culture prevalent in the company via a blogpost which eventually took down its iconic founder, Travis Kalanick. There have been many similar stories of late in the Indian context as well. High Growth And Toxicity High growth results in several important organisational processes being bypassed, especially when it comes to hiring or acting swiftly on deviant behaviour. The pressure to hire and staff open positions, sometimes, is so overpowering that managers and leaders don't take “reference checks” seriously, and even turn a blind eye to early warning signals that are detected at different stages including in the interview process. At that point of time, it appears that the only thing that matters is getting the required “resources” on board and ticking off one big item in the checklist. Creating a good culture is time consuming but all that’s needed to destroy it is just a few wrong hires. Elements of toxic culture creep in slowly, especially in regions that are remote and distant from corporate headquarters and can go undetected for a long time unless mechanisms to detect and crack down on such toxicity are active and vibrant. And during phases of high growth, such mechanisms are not sufficiently nurtured and hence become sluggish. Therefore, it often takes a blow-up for leaders to sit up and realise that something is wrong and needs fixing. High growth expectations in private companies and the quarterly cadence of public companies result in excessive prioritisation of short-term outcomes, and leaders turn a blind eye to behaviours that create long-term damage. The subconscious argument or justification is that the short-term benefits are visible and tangible, whereas the long-term damage is mostly intangible and, in any case, would probably have to be dealt with by someone else. What’s The Way Out? The challenges associated with high growth, described above, cannot be wished away. They need to be managed and contained like in the case of BigBasket. If important leaders, both globally and locally, who are culture creators and evangelisers are selected carefully without compromise, a large part of the problem is taken care of because they in turn would send the right signals every day in every part of the company. When it comes to avoiding toxicity at the workplace, a combination of intent and execution is critical. One might be tempted to believe that good intent is universal, and that the problem is always with the execution. That isn’t true. Good intent isn’t in abundance as one might imagine. It needs character to stay faithful to good intent under pressure. And to top it, just good intent is not enough. It needs to be backed up by a commitment to taking some tough decisions and hard calls to reinforce the intent. It needs clarity to understand the long-term adverse effects of the shortcuts that one resorts to when the goals are aggressive. Mechanisms to detect and act on toxic elements of culture need to be continually strengthened and nurtured. TN Hari is Co-founder, Artha School of Entrepreneurship. Twitter: @TNHari.

The merged entity will have a total home loan book of Rs 7.3 lakh crore, compared with SBI’s portfolio of Rs 6.4 lakh crore as of March 2023, a Moneycontrol analysis showed.    HDFC’s home loan portfolio was Rs 6.25 lakh crore, whereas that of HDFC Bank stood at Rs 1.02 lakh crore. HDFC Bank’s relatively smaller home loan book was because the bank wasn’t active in the mortgage business and typically passed on home loan customers to the parent company.  Also read: RBI allows HDFC Bank to hike stake in HDFC Life, HDFC ERGO to more than 50%  Other banks with a significant home loan book include ICICI Bank with Rs 3.46 lakh crore as of March, Axis Bank with Rs 1.57 lakh crore and Punjab National Bank with Rs 81,863 crore.  The merger is only about a month away, Sashidhar Jagdishan, managing director of HDFC Bank, said on an analyst call on May 24.  “It's now just another four or five weeks before the big day that is going to be happening, which is the merger with HDFC,” Jagdishan said.  The combined entity will have a total balance sheet of Rs 18 lakh crore and market capitalisation of Rs 14 lakh crore.  Interest income  Experts said the merger will boost the bank’s loan book and improve the net interest margin (NIM) too. NIM is the difference between interest income earned and interest paid by a bank.  According to Ashvin Parekh, MD of Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services, the NIM of HDFC Bank will improve by 175 to 200 basis points (bps).  Also read: HDFC to complete its merger with HDFC Bank by July  HDFC Bank's current NIM stands at 4.1 percent.  “The quality of the housing loan portfolio will improve as HDFC will bring in a massive customer base. For a while, HDFC Bank will have the largest housing finance portfolio, but later we may see competition from other bigger players,” said Parekh.    “After the merger, HDFC Bank will be second to SBI in terms of market size. But with steady loan growth over the next five years, we can see HDFC Bank becoming the country’s largest bank,” said Aditya Shah, a banking analyst.  An analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said the Reserve Bank of India may look at reducing the repo rate, which could work in favour of the bank.  “The lowering of the repo rate will only work in favour of HDFC Bank as the deposit rate will come down,” the analyst said.  The RBI has increased the policy repo rate by 250 basis points since May 2022 and left it unchanged at 6.5 percent in April, suggesting that the central bank could start cutting rates soon. Some clarity may emerge after the RBI meeting this week.  Mortgage market  Many banks reported double-digit growth in their home loan portfolio for the quarter ended March 2023.  ICICI Bank reported an 18 percent growth in its home loan portfolio to Rs 3.46 lakh crore from Rs 2.96 lakh crore in March 2022. Axis Bank said its home loan portfolio grew 10 percent to Rs 1.57 lakh crore.  According to a report by SBI in August 2022, India’s home loan market is set to double by 2027.  “Post COVID-19, working from home has emerged as a dominant trend that is redefining the mortgage loan demand for the household sector,” SBI said.  In 2015, Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC, said his company could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were favourable.  HDFC Bank agreed on April 4 last year to take over the country’s leading mortgage company in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. The deal was termed the biggest in India’s corporate history.

The Nifty fell 186.80 points to end at 18,069.00. About 1,436 shares advanced, 1,977 shares declined, and 123 shares were unchanged. Take a look at the top gainers and losers   TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 1,215 | Shares of TVS Motor Company gained 4 percent after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and strong outlook. The company reported a 50 percent jump in its standalone net profit to Rs 410.30 crore for the quarter ended March 2023, as against Rs 274.50 crore a year ago.   Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 106.25 | Shares of Manappuram Finance Ltd slumped 10 percent after the Enforcement Directorate froze assets worth Rs 143 crore of the prominent Kerala-based NBFC’s MD and CEO VP Nandakumar in a money laundering case.   Hero MotoCorp | CMP: Rs 2,542 | Hero MotoCorp shares gained a percent after the company announced its fourth-quarter results. The stock recovered most of its lost ground since its disappointing April sales numbers, when both domestic and export volumes reflected a slump in demand. The two-wheeler maker beat Street estimates with its net profit up 37 percent YoY to Rs 859 crore and revenue rising 12 percent to Rs 8,307 crore.   AGI Greenpac | CMP: Rs 496 | Shares of AGI Greenpac soared 20 percent touching its all-time high of Rs 496.10, as strong quarterly earnings prompted investors to buy the stock.

The Nifty 50 closed 1.02% lower at 18,069.00, while the S&amp;amp;P BSE Sensex lost 1.13% to 61,054.29.  Financials stocks led the slide in the Nifty, falling 2.34% in the worst single-day drop in over three months.  Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd declined over 5.5% each after MSCI said it included the merged entity of the two companies in its large-cap index, but with an adjustment factor of 0.5.  Nuvama Research estimated this would lead to an outflow of $150 million to $200 million from the entity.  ”The event is one-time, but the businesses of HDFC and HDFC Bank are perpetual,” said Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research at Profitmart Securities, adding that the fall in the shares is temporary.  Analysts expected Nifty 50 to consolidate after the recent rise on strong March-quarter earnings, but added that monsoons would be a key monitorable in the near term.  ”If monsoons are poor, it will spark a slide in markets due to adverse impact on the country’s predominantly agri-linked economy and consumption,” Gorakshakar added.  European Central Bank’s rate hike and concerns in the U.S. banking sector due to the collapse of PacWest Bancorp also dragged investor sentiment.  Among individual stocks, TVS Motor Company Ltd jumped nearly 4% to a record high after reporting an uptick in March-quarter profit.

The Karvy demat scam, when it came under the public glare, raised thorny issues of regulatory failure and brought to the fore embarrassing shortfalls in SEBI's scope of supervision. One can gauge the gravity and critical attention accorded to this issue from the recent comment of SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch, who emphatically spelt out that another Karvy-like event will happen over the regulator's dead body.  Also read: SEBI’s Brightcom order: Many firsts in a complex area that needs many more orders for conclusive jurisprudence  In an order delivered by Whole Time Member SK Mohanty, the market regulator has directed Karvy Realty (India) Limited and Karvy Capital Limited, two subsidiaries of KSBL, that were beneficiaries of illegal transfers from their parent company to return an amount of Rs 1,442.95 crore within three months. If the two beneficiary companies fail in returning the transferred funds, NSE has been directed to take control of assets of the two companies, in order to recover the amount. The aforementioned funds were transferred out of KSBL between FY17 and FY20.  The market regulator has also penalised KSBL and its MD Comandur Parthasarathy to the tune of Rs 13 crore and Rs 8 crore respectively for violations of several SEBI circulars and regulations. It has also barred KSBL and Parthasarathy from accessing the securities and dealing in securities, in any manner, for a period of seven years.  Independent directors of the company, namely, Bhagwan Das Narang and Jyothi Prasad have also been penalised to pay an amount of Rs 5 lakh. Both of them have also been restrained from holding the post of director, or any key managerial position or associating themselves in any capacity with any listed public company and any public company for a period of two years.  Lastly, CEO Rajiv Ranjan Singh, who was found to have acted negligently and failed in exercising due diligence has been cautioned and has been directed &quot;to be careful before associating himself as a director or any key managerial position in any intermediary of the securities market or any listed public company&quot;.  The Karvy demat scam, which first came to light in the second half of 2019, was orchestrated by the brokerage house by pledging securities lying in the demat account of unsuspecting customers. The pledging, which happened behind the customer's back, was done to raise funds from banks and other NBFCs. Loans were raised from the likes of HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance and others.  In September 2016, KSBL’s outstanding borrowing under the loan against securities (LAS) facility offered by banks stood at Rs 789.41 crore, with the overall borrowing standing at Rs 1,051.36 crore. The said overall borrowing of KSBL increased to Rs 2,032.67 crore by September 30, 2019.  Simultaneously, there was a substantial increase in the pledging of securities by KSBL. The value of securities pledged increased from Rs 202 crore on June 30, 2017, to Rs 1,855 crore by March 2018 and had further increased to Rs 2,700 crore by September 2019.  The regulator also found out that as on September 05, 2019, at least 75 percent of the total shares in all its clients’ holdings were pledged by KSBL to borrow funds for its own use, which included cases where the clients’ holdings were pledged despite such clients having credit balances in their accounts maintained with KSBL.  &quot;The massive asset mobilization drive followed by raising of huge sums of funds from financial institutions by using the securities mobilized from the clients with a promise to pay them interest and misappropriating those funds...speak a tell-tale story of fraud driven by the greed of KSBL and its management to amass thousands of crore of rupees at the cost of its innocent clients, making it a fit case where SEBI needs to send out a firm message to deter the stock brokers and their managements from indulging in such acts of unethical, unfair and fraudulent behaviour as observed in this case,&quot; the WTM observed in its order.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-delivers-final-order-in-karvy-demat-scam-cracks-down-on-md-and-directors-10495611.html
HDFC,2023-04-28T10:16:39+05:30,Andy Mukherjee,"India’s banks have it all, except caution","Strong profit growth has put Indian financiers’ optimism in overdrive, but is it sustainable? Skimping on loss provisions is risky, especially when this strategy has backfired in the past","India’s banks spent most of the last decade out in the wilderness, as a punishment for the lax underwriting standards on their corporate loans. Now they have regained their health, restored profitability and reestablished investors’ trust. The benchmark Nifty Bank Index is close to an all-time high. With everything going well, the lenders should be turning cautious. But recent full-year results show an opposite trend: Provisions for future loan losses are beginning to decline. This may not be prudent.  Across most of Asia, muted big-ticket consumer expenditure — such as on housing — and restrained capital expenditure by firms have led to only a mild post-pandemic recovery in credit, which makes India’s double-digit loan growth a notable exception, according to economists at Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd Just last month, New Delhi-based developer DLF Ltd sold $1 billion worth of million-dollar homes on the outskirts of the national capital in 72 hours. A one-year, 29 percent jump in credit-card debt has made even the Reserve Bank of India, the regulator, a little uncomfortable. The central bank has cautioned lenders about the risk of delinquencies on their unsecured loans at meetings over at least the past three months, Reuters reported recently.  Yet, HDFC Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, two of the country's largest lenders by market value, slashed their loss provisions for the financial year that ended in March by 23 percent. The money ICICI has set aside cumulatively is now 9 billion rupees ($122 million) less than a year ago. That isn’t a problem yet, because gross nonperforming assets have declined at a faster pace of 27 billion rupees. However, there’s nothing to suggest that they won’t rise again.  With the incremental credit-to-deposit ratio running at 111 percent, Indian banks will have to pay more to savers — sacrificing some part of their high profitability. Although even this won’t affect all lenders equally. Higher deposit costs “will tip the scale in favor of our rated banks, allowing them larger bargaining power to price the loans and hence to defend their margins,” according to Rebecca Tan, a senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. Problems may erupt elsewhere. “The key risk we are watching really is the quality of these bank loans to small-and-medium-sized enterprises and that’s predominantly because of the current rising rate environment,” she said in a Bloomberg TV interview last month.  Since then, an unexpected pause in monetary tightening by the central bank has provided some reprieve, though the effects of a cumulative 250-basis-point increase in rates will be felt for some more time. High interest rates may be particularly worrisome for the risk-chasing behavior of nonbank financial institutions, or NBFIs, which don’t have access to low-cost deposits. “We believe more NBFIs are pursuing higher-yielding loans to offset greater pressure on funding costs and net interest margins,” Fitch Ratings said Thursday. Aggressive growth could “pressure lenders to take inordinate risks, which could weaken asset quality and credit profiles when the economic cycle turns,” it added.  Banks aren’t exactly oblivious to the danger. Excluding retail and rural lending, ICICI now has only 0.8 percent of its loan portfolio exposed to riskier firms rated BB or below. Two years ago, the figure was as high as 3.6 percent. Axis Bank Ltd, the fifth-largest lender, didn’t have to utilise its COVID-19-related loss cushion in the March quarter. As a result, even with a 64 percent drop in full-year provisions, it still has gross bad loans covered to the extent of 145 percent. However, all of this is backward looking. The retail loan book for both HDFC Bank and ICICI has grown by 1 trillion rupees apiece over the past 12 months. Axis saw almost a 900 billion rupee increase, while Bajaj Finance Ltd, a specialist nonbank lender to consumers and small firms, expanded its assets by about 500 billion rupees. Retail credit by just these four Indian lenders has expanded by almost the same amount in one year as the entire growth in the Thai banking system over the past four. And yet, Bajaj, too, has cut back on loss provisions by 34 percent.  Clearly, strong profit growth has put Indian financiers’ optimism in overdrive, but is it sustainable? The previous bout of unbridled enthusiasm for corporate lending ended with more than $200 billion in nonperforming assets, one of the world’s worst piles of bad loans. This time around, individuals’ data has replaced the collateral of plants and machines. Digital lending is the new mantra. The belief seems to be that any lender whose portfolio of unsecured retail loans is not increasing by 50 percent annually is simply not trying hard enough.  &amp;nbsp;  But consumer demand is being led by a small pocket of affluence. The 6.5 percent growth in gross domestic product that the government is penciling in for the fiscal year that began this month faces several risks. Turmoil in the US banking industry is making India’s $245 billion software-export industry gloomy. A sustained rise in oil prices, currently kept in check by  global growth concerns, would crimp already-limited purchasing power of urban low- and middle-income workers amid high unemployment. Meanwhile, climate change could dash any hope of a recovery in stagnant real wages in rural areas. Summer temperatures are above normal by about 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country. Heat waves could damage crops and cause power shortages.  It’s time lenders behaved a little more prudently. The aggregate bad-loan ratio of 4.41 percent at the end of last year was the lowest since March 2015. The system has “remained resilient and not been affected by the recent sparks of financial instability seen in some advanced economies,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a web-streamed address Thursday. Still, the central bank has “started looking at the business models of banks more closely,” he said. As it indeed should. For years, the stock market couldn’t expect even 1 percent return on assets from a vast swathe of the Indian banking industry. Now that things have changed, 2 percent should be good enough for current investors — with the rest of the profit kept aside to deal with future losses. Unusual as it is from a regional perspective, the credit upswing in India may not be at a risk of abrupt reversal. But since it’s a cycle, at some point it will turn.

HDFC,2023-04-24T13:03:15+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,Banking Central | Two private lenders make the field for bulls in banking space,ICICI Bank numbers add to the optimism in the sector while RBI clarifications offer much needed clarity to HDFC Bank’s investors.  ,"Over the weekend, all eyes were on the ICICI Bank, as the lender announced a good set of numbers on Saturday. The key numbers—both on growth and asset quality—throw up good news for the bank and map the road ahead for the industry. Typically, big bank earnings are good indicators of the banking system health and business momentum.  The lender’s loan book grew around 19 percent on a year-on-year basis, while deposits grew by 11 percent. The net interest margin, the spread between interest earned and interest expended, jumped sharply to 4.90 percent in Q4 of FY2023 as against 4 percent same period last year.  These numbers add to the industry’s optimism of a sharp turnaround.  To be sure, one needs to wait for other large banks to confirm a pattern but if ICICI Bank numbers are any indication, the Indian banking industry is looking at a bull run ahead. On the asset quality front, most of the large-ticket NPA cases are either pushed to the bankruptcy court or written off.  According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, the gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) declined to 4.5 percent in December 2022 from 6.5 percent a year ago. According to RBI rules, a loan is classified as NPA if there is no repayment of principal or interest for a period of 90 days. Banks have to set aside money, called provisions, against such loans. This impacts their profitability.   Banking Central  Loan demand too is picking up and large banks are looking at quality projects to fund on the wholesale side while the broader thrust seems to be on the retail book. In case of ICICI Bank, the lender’s retail loan portfolio grew 22.7 percent on-year and comprised 54.7 percent of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2023. Its business banking portfolio grew 34.9 percent YoY on March 31, 2023, while small medium enterprises (SME) business grew by 19.2 percent YoY. ICICI Bank's rural portfolio widened 13.8 percent on-year and 5.5 percent on-quarter at March 31, 2023. The credit growth, across the industry shows signs of revival after the pandemic phase.  RBI clarification for HDFC Bank  The second major event for the banking sector was a clarification for the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger following certain requests made by the lender ahead of the merger. Among the issues the regulator has clarified, the two key ones-- related to priority sector lending obligations (PSL) and treatment of investments in subsidiaries—are important. The RBI has permitted HDFC Bank to spread the additional PSL over three years.  PSL refers to mandatory lending by banks to economically weaker sections of the society. Banks have to lend at least 40 percent of their money to such segments, of which 18 percent must be to agriculture. Given the size of the merged entity, this would have been a tremendous burden for HDFC Bank in the initial years of transition. Failure to meet PSL will require banks to invest in RIDF (Rural Infrastructure Development Fund) of Nabard. The staggered implementation of PSL will lessen the burden on the bank and impact on margins.  Also, permission to increase stake in HDFC Life and HDFC Ergo will help the bank mitigate the valuation concerns of subsidiaries. In the approaching days, we will see more banks announcing their quarterly earnings which should give further clarity on the business momentum.

Hence merged entity would not incur any PSL cost in FY25E resulting in core PAT upgrade of 2%. 3) Bank has to comply with CRR, SLR and LCR requirements. Hence, dispensation in terms affordable housing bonds may not be available, which would increase CRR, SLR needs albeit minimally. NIM impact would be insignificant.

HDFC,2023-04-24T09:54:21+05:30,Moneycontrol News,HDFC Life surges 8% on RBI nod to stake hike after merger of HDFC twins,"Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd surged by more than 8%, its maximum gains in one year, on April 24 after the Reserve Bank of India allowed the merged HDFC-HDFC Bank to increase its shareholding in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50%. ","Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd surged to a one-year peak of more than 8 percent early on April 24 after the Reserve Bank of India allowed raising the stake in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50 percent following the merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank.  The stock gained as much as 8.2 percent - its biggest since April 4, 2022 - to a high of Rs 554.60 on the BSE. At 9.35am, the stock was trading at Rs 545, up 6 percent from previous close.  According to Emkay and Nuvama Research, the decision by the RBI to hold more than 50 percent stake by HDFC twins in insurance entities is a significant boost for HDFC Life.  The management has not quantified how much they will increase the stake to. The theoretical limit is 100 percent.  &quot;We believe it should be 50-60 percent. The Street had a high probability of this relaxation coming through. In the analyst day last year, the management had explained that a higher stake would also mean higher cross-sell,&quot; Nuvama said.  According to Emkay, this decision will result in two major benefits for HDFC Life. First, HDFC Life will become a direct subsidiary of HDFC Bank, leading to a potential improvement in its current 50 percent share in the HDFC Bank channel, as well as an increase in margins due to an anticipated reduction in the cost of distribution in the HDFC Bank channel.  Second, the concern about a possible 19 percent stake sale by HDFC-HDFC Bank (which currently holds 48.65 percent stake in HDFC Life) if the RBI had directed them to keep their stake below 30 percent, is now eliminated, and it is confirmed that HDFC-HDFC Bank will acquire fresh or secondary over 1.35 percent stake before the merger-completion, an Ekmay report said.  Most industry experts agreed that the RBI's decision would have a positive impact on HDFC Life, but opinions were divided regarding the decision itself. &quot;The timing of the RBI's decision is noteworthy, as the regulatory and taxation environment for the life insurance industry is rapidly changing, which could have adverse effects. Additionally, other listed life insurance companies are facing challenges of their own. However, with the removal of the significant overhang that previously existed, HDFC Life is well-positioned to grow profitably and increase its market share,&quot; the report added.  Emkay has upgraded HDFC Life to 'buy' with a target price of Rs 650 a share. &quot;To reflect the impact of the new synergistic HDFC Bank-HDFC Life relationship, we change our FY24-25 estimates and upgrade the stock...

ITC and State Bank of India were the only gainers.","Eight of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,17,493.78 crore in market valuation in an overall weak trend in equities last week, with Infosys taking the biggest hit.  Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank were among the eight companies that suffered a decline in their valuation. ITC and State Bank of India were the only gainers.  Last week, the 30-share BSE Sensex fell by 775.94 points or 1.28 per cent.  The market valuation of Infosys plummeted by Rs 66,854.05 crore to Rs 5,09,215 crore. Infosys Ltd on April 13 reported lower-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter net profit and gave a weak 4-7 per cent revenue growth guidance for FY24 amid tightening of IT budgets by clients following turmoil in the US banking sector.  HDFC Bank's valuation tumbled Rs 10,880.5 crore to Rs 9,33,937.35 crore.  ICICI Bank lost Rs 10,462.77 crore from its valuation which stood at Rs 6,17,477.46 crore and the market capitalisation (mcap) of TCS tanked Rs 10,318.52 crore to Rs 11,56,863.98 crore.

HDFC,2023-04-21T19:59:10+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,HDFC-HDFC Bank merger: Why RBI clarification comes as a relief for the banking giant,"More time to comply with PSL requirements takes away the immediate burden from the bank. Similarly, clarity on holdings in investments and subsidiaries will clear air for investors.","The country’s largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, recently said that it has received some clarifications from the banking regulator with respect to its proposed merger with the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC). These clarifications were given after the bank sought certain relaxations from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make the process of merger smooth. The merger is expected to take effect by July this year.  A quick look at the clarifications shows HDFC Bank has received relief in certain major areas. The biggest relief is in relation to the priority sector lending (PSL) norms. Under the rules, a banking entity needs to lend 40 percent of the adjusted net bank credit to the so-called priority sector or economically weaker sections such as agriculture, micro-enterprises and other economically weaker sections.  If HDFC Bank (the combined entity) had to meet this on day 1 of the merger, it would have been a big jolt. But now, the RBI has clarified that HDFC Bank can calculate the adjusted net bank credit considering one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC Limited as on the effective date of the amalgamation for the first year.  The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio of HDFC Limited can be considered over a period of the next two years equally, the RBI said. This means HDFC Bank will have around three years to comply with PSL norms. In fact, the PSL requirement kicks in only 12 months after the effective date of the merger, according to the bank.  In short, this will be a significant reduction in cost. The second big clarification is on the treatment of investments in subsidiaries. Investors were worried that the bank may be asked to cut stakes in key subsidiaries such as HDFC Life. Here, the RBI has clarified that investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited are allowed to continue as investments of HDFC Bank.  The RBI has permitted HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding to more than 50 percent in HDFC Life Insurance Company and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company. This is another major good news for the bank and investors. HDFC, as on March 2023, already has 49 percent stake in HDFC Life.  The parent company had earlier held a majority stake in HDFC Life at 50.14 percent in September 2020. To comply with RBI guidelines of 50 percent limit, the stake was cut to 49.99 percent in December 2020, 49.88 in December 2021 and to 48.65 percent in March 2023. Logically, the bank can now hike the stake in HDFC Life to over 50 percent, which may happen eventually.  Further, the RBI has permitted HDFC Bank to continue holding HDFC’s stake in HDFC Education and Development Services Private Limited, engaged in operating three education schools, for a period of two years from the effective date and HDFC Credila Financial Services Limited, subject to the shareholding being brought down to 10 percent within two years from the effective date.  In simple terms, what this all means is that HDFC Bank, post its merger, will get close control of all subsidiaries much like its rival conglomerates like ICICI Bank. One of the major concerns of investors in the run-up to the merger was the likely treatment of subsidiaries. With the RBI clarification, that worry is gone.  The not-so-good part of the clarification is that all the mandatory reserve requirements such as CRR (cash reserve ratio), SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) and LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) will be set in on the first day of the merger. But, considering the larger reliefs on PSL and subsidiary treatment, this will likely be a lesser worry for the combined entity.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-hdfc-bank-merger-why-rbi-clarification-is-a-relief-for-the-banking-major-10455141.html
HDFC,2023-04-21T19:30:24+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"HDFC Bank merger: RBI’s regulatory leeway positive for stock, say analysts",The RBI has allowed HDFC Bank to meet priority sector lending norms in a staggered manner over three years post the HDFC merger,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed some regulatory relief to HDFC Bank ahead of its merger with HDFC, which is a positive for the stock, analysts said.  In a regulatory filing on April 21, HDFC Bank said the RBI has allowed calculating the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (for PSL) considering only one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC as on the effective date of the amalgamation for the first year.  The remaining two-thirds shall be considered over the next two years equally.  Also Read: RBI allows HDFC Bank to hike stake in HDFC Life, HDFC ERGO to more than 50%  “Assuming PSL requirements would kick in only in FY25, PSL cost would reduce from Rs 20 bn to Rs 5 bn implying a core PAT upgrade of 2 percent,” brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note.  Domestic banks are required to lend 40 percent of their total disbursal to the priority sector, which includes agriculture, MSMEs, education, housing, export credit and advances to weaker sections.  “The HDFC Ltd portfolio will be allowed three years (in equal instalments), after the first year post merger, to become PSL compliant. This is against the earlier assumption of 18 months from effective date to be PSL compliant,” Dhananjay Sinha of Systematix Group told Moneycontrol.  Also read: HDFC to complete its merger with HDFC Bank by July  Investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited have been allowed to continue as investments of HDFC Bank.  The RBI has also allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50 percent. “This certainly removes the overhang of RoE dilution due to stake sale. Also this would be a positive for HDFC Life,” the brokerage said.  Assuming the stake would increase to 51 percent, sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) impact would be Rs 3-4 on HDFC Bank’s target price of Rs 1,925, it noted.  The stock should see a positive reaction, it added.  “The RBI rule had originally mandated that the shareholding in the insurance subsidiary can be either above 50 percent or at 30 percent. With the current HDFC Ltd shareholding in HDFC Life at 48.65 percent, there was the overhang on HDFC Life shares of the possibility of selling from HDFC Ltd to become compliant with the extant regulations,” Sinha said, adding this removes a major overhang on HDFC Life shares.  No relaxation has been granted on CRR, SLR and LCR norms, which was the consensus view and HDFC Bank has also utilised the time from announcement of merger to plan for this eventuality, he added.  In a recent note, Prabhudas Lilladher assigned a buy rating on HDFC Bank with target price of Rs 1,925. Based on April 21’s closing price of Rs 1,673.80, this implies a potential upside of nearly 15 percent.  Termed as the biggest transaction in India’s corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4 last year agreed to take over the biggest housing finance company in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore.  The deal has got in-principle approval from the stock exchanges, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), SEBI, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), and Competition Commission of India (CCI).",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hdfc-bank-merger-rbis-regulatory-leeway-positive-for-stock-say-analysts-10455991.html

The bank said the apex bank has allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC Ltd to increase the shareholding to more than 50 percent in HDFC Life Insurance and HDFC ERGO General Insurance prior to the effective date of the merger.  “Investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited are continued as investments of HDFC Bank,” said the bank.  Also read: HDFC to complete its merger with HDFC Bank by July  This is part of the clarifications provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for the merger of HDFC and HDFC Ltd, according to the filing.

Further, the remaining two-thirds of the portfolio of HDFC Limited can be considered over a period of next two years equally, said the bank.  But how will this impact the merged company?  According to RBI regulations, 40 percent of a bank’s total lending portfolio should be towards PSL. Out of the 40 percent, 18 percent should be towards agriculture.  Given that RBI has allowed hdfc bank to spread over the PSL liability across three years, experts said that this a positive move for the bank as it will have time to work on the portfolio and divide it across three years.  &quot;HDFC Bank will get about 3 years to completely comply with these norms. This is positive for the bank as it can divide its lending portfolio across three year&quot; said Aditya Shah, a financial and banking analyst.  Experts also said that since fulfilling the PSL requirement will take time, there could be a possible marginal profit growth.  &quot;Assuming PSL requirements would kick in only in fiscal year (FY) 2024-25, PSL cost would reduce from Rs 20 billion to Rs 5 billion implying a core profit after tax (PAT) upgrade of 2 percent,&quot; said a banking analyst.  Increasing stake in subsidiary  The apex bank, in 2021, in its guidelines for non-banking financial companies (NBFC) and housing finance company (HFC) said that a HFC parent company cannot hold a stake of more than 50 percent in its life insurance subsidiary.  &quot;The maximum equity contribution such an HFC can hold in the JV Company will normally be 50 percent of the paid-up capital of the insurance company,&quot; RBI said in the guideline.  HDFC Ltd, as of March 2023, holds 48.65 percent stake in HDFC Life, its life insurance subsidiary. The parent company held a majority stake in HDFC Life at 50.14 percent in September 2020. After RBI guidelines, it started reducing its stake in HDFC Life from 49.88 percent in December 2021 to 48.65 percent in March 2023.  Experts said that in line with the permission of increased holding in its subsidiaries by the RBI, now the merged company will have almost all subsidiaries within itself.  One could assume that the parent company’s stake in HDFC Life could increase to 51 percent. This could impact the stock price by Rs 3-4 on its trading price of around Rs1925,” said the bank analyst mentioned above.  &quot;HDFC Bank can even increase its stake in HDFC Credila. It will have all the subsidiaries within itself just like its closest private sector competitor, ICICI Bank. The hangover for subsidiaries gets removed. A large part of the de-rating of HDFC Life was due to the uncertainty of the merger. This goes away now,&quot; Shah said.  The regulator also clarified that HDFC Bank shall continue to comply with extant requirements of CRR, SLR and LCR from the Effective Date without exceptions.  The merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Deepak Parekh, the chairman of the country’s leading mortgage company, had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

HDFC,2023-04-18T17:41:01+05:30,Aparna Iyer,MC Long View: No triggers for HDFC Bank re-rating,"The merger with HDFC will determine HDFC Bank stock’s performance over the next few months. Analysts worry that the costs associated with the merger would be significant, already visible in the high operating expenses in Q4FY23.","Between calendar 2012 and 2022, HDFC Bank Ltd grew its balance sheet by 22.5 percent on a compounded annual growth rate basis. Its stock returned 19.5 percent CAGR, beating peers State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. The private sector lender’s stock topped the list of every analyst’s buy ratings, be it during times of crisis or recovery.  Ever since the bank announced the merger with its parent HDFC in April last year, its stock has barely kept up with peers. Note that swallowing HDFC would instantly add more than 40 percent to the bank’s assets.  Morphing from David to Goliath isn’t easy and has costs. What complicates the matter for HDFC Bank is the management’s indication of a regulatory dispensation for the merger.  Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities summed this up perfectly. They noted that the bank is taking on high fixed costs through branch expansion, almost guaranteeing an elevated cost-to-income ratio.  Further, the ability to increase deposits post-merger “is still not yet established.” Lastly, key questions pertaining to the merger on regulatory dispensation are “still unanswered.”  Gearing for merger  Since a non-bank finance company would merge into a bank, regulatory costs such as cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) would be significant. Along with the merger announcement, the bank’s management alluded to discussions with the Reserve Bank of India over dispensations such as a glide path to adhere to CRR and SLR and even priority sector norms.  Most analysts said these are key aspects to the stock’s re-rating as they gave HDFC Bank an edge on earnings visibility.  “The merger outcome may take precedence over business performance, near term, with uncertainty from: a) liability-side transition, b) uncertain cost and c) PSL (priority sector lending) requirement. Given the nature of these, the impact is hard to gauge, and the outcome contingent on regulatory action/market condition,” analysts at Elara Capital wrote in a note.  To be sure, chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan made it clear to analysts during the Q2 earnings that the dispensations are good to have but are not reflected in the balance sheet projections of the bank post-merger.  “The merger is not predicated on this, the models are not necessarily assumed that these need to come. These are good to have, not necessary as such,” he said.  But when you are as consistent a performer as HDFC Bank, investors tend to take stellar numbers for granted and look for an additional earnings boost. A regulatory dispensation is just that.  Embracing an assets pile of Rs 7.01 lakh crore consisting mainly of long-term home loans entails changes to the liabilities side. HDFC’s borrowings totalled Rs 5.43 lakh crore as of December, of which 30 percent were from deposits.  Once merged with HDFC Bank, this would result in the share of borrowings in the bank’s liabilities growing to almost 20 percent. Also, the deposits would attract CRR and SLR.  That’s not all. HDFC Bank would need to garner deposits at a fast pace to keep up with the growth on an outsized asset pile now. This explains the bank’s efforts to get deposits over the past one year.  This was also where HDFC Bank won investors’ hearts through its performance in Q4 of FY23. The lender added Rs 1.5 lakh crore worth of deposits during the quarter, its biggest ever.  It hasn’t slowed its pace of branch expansion, either. The flipside? A surge in operating expenses, which analysts said will continue to stay elevated.  “Bank would continue to ramp up its branch network/customer addition to stock up deposits which may keep funding and sourcing costs elevated and the NIMs/core-PPoP (pre-provisioning operating profit) growth in check,” analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services noted in a report.  Those at Prabhudas Lilladher pencilled in operating expenses rising at a 21 percent CAGR in FY22-25.  As liabilities churn, it all comes down to margins for earnings growth.   HDFC Bank margins hold up  That margin call  The biggest selling point of the merger is the benefit of cost of funds through deposits of HDFC Bank. But this will happen over time. Meanwhile, HDFC Bank could face a short-term squeeze on margins as higher-cost borrowings come on board. Further, it is grabbing deposits during an elevated interest rate cycle.  Net interest margin shrank by 14 basis points sequentially in Q4, a sign that the bank is facing pressure on margins. Analysts at Kotak warned that most banks are mobilising deposits aggressively and that would be a big challenge for HDFC Bank.  The management has said margins will remain in a range as the bank’s fixed rate loans will get repriced, offsetting the higher cost of deposits somewhat. That said, analysts are concerned about the extent of margin pressure that may come from pursuing deposits aggressively.  “Increased competitive intensity, especially given the benign asset quality environment, will be another drag on NIM,” Kotak pointed out.  The merger with HDFC will determine the stock’s performance over the next few months. Beyond that, the odds of HDFC Bank growing at a fast pace become lesser as it gains critical mass.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/mc-long-view-no-triggers-for-hdfc-bank-re-rating-10433311.html

HDFC,2023-04-18T08:39:07+05:30,Santosh Nair,"Short Call | Let's talk of Angel One, costly deposits, and why market operators are glum despite rally","The overall market sentiment has improved considerably over the last three weeks, but investors are in no hurry to loosen their purse strings","“Companies focused on stock price will eventually lose customers. Those focused on customers will eventually boost their stock price. This is simple, but forgotten by countless managers.” -  Morgan Housel  Tech stocks are to be avoided for the foreseeable future-that is the common refrain in the market right now after disappointing numbers from tech bellwether Infosys. The overall market sentiment has improved considerably over the last three weeks, but investors are in no hurry to loosen their purse strings.  Angel One  Yet another strong quarterly performance from broking firm Angel One; net profit up 30 percent year-on-year, revenue up 21 percent and operating margin up 310 basis points. This underscores a market truism that whether or not customers make money, the broker always does. But investors have cooled to the broking story a few quarters back. This can be seen from the lower valuations that broking stocks in general are now getting.    Angel has grown its net profit and revenues in eight out of the nine previous quarters, but the stock is now available at a trailing price earnings multiple of 12 times, compared to 25 times during the same time last year. The stock is a good 34 percent away from its record highs seen in April last year despite consistent growth in earnings. One reason for the apathy to broking stocks is that retail investors are not rushing to the market with the same enthusiasm as was seen till a few months back. New account openings have slowed down and are expected to stay that way for a while given mediocre returns from equity for about a year now.  But a bigger worry is that regulatory changes will make it hard for the broking industry to repeat the growth rates of the past. Sebi's greenlight for the use of ASBA in secondary markets for cash market transactions may soon extend to F&amp;amp;O transactions as well, many feel. This will starve brokers of the interest they have been earning on ‘float’, i.e. the customer money lying idle in trading accounts, a major revenue stream for brokers.  HDFC Bank  The stock fell over 1 percent on Monday after the company’s fourth quarter earnings fell short of what market was expecting. There were enough positives though: strong growth in loans, deposits and improvement in asset quality. Deposit growth has been a major pain point for most banks. As Digant Haria of Green Edge Wealth points out, even banks which have managed to show decent deposit growth have had to pay dearly for it.  He says that HDFC Bank’s deposit growth has come at a cost, as the bank is offering higher rates than its peers for the first time in 12-13 years. Near term outlook on banks is much better than for most other sectors. But much of the good news already appears to have been priced in. Investors will be keeping an eagle eye on net interest margins (NIMs) to decide what multiples they should be paying for bank stocks.  Rally without cheer  The recent rally in mid-caps and small-caps has been of little cheer to big ticket traders (read market operators). That’s because liquidity has not been good enough for them to be able to move in and out of large positions quickly. Many of them are said to be stuck with huge positions in flavour-of-the-season midcaps like sugar and railway. Till about a year back, operators could always count on the good offices of some friendly mutual fund and PMS fund managers to bail them out.  But average quarterly earnings from front-liners like TCS, Infosys, HDFC Bank has made investors all the more wary about second line stocks. Besides, closer scrutiny from Sebi is giving a pause for thought to portfolio managers before entering into cosy deals with market operators. In addition, investors appear reluctant to overpay for even the best of stories in this market.  In case of railway stocks, many are no longer reacting to a steady stream of order win announcements over the last couple of months, making it difficult for operators to cash in on their paper profits.  China GDP  The Chinese economy grew 4.5 percent in the first quarter, more than what opinion polls showed. This is the highest growth since the first quarter of 2022.  From CNBC.com  “But economists have warned China’s economic recovery could take longer than expected — with the likes of Citi pushing back its target for the Hang Seng index by three months. While most analysts polled by Reuters don’t expect to see a change in the central bank’s benchmark lending rate, some believe the People’s Bank of China could marginally cut its one-year loan prime rate if China’s inflation slows further.”  Wide range  Worries about a steep rise in crude prices because of the recent production cuts by OPEC may be overdone. Predictions by four energy agencies for oil demand growth in 2023 vary widely, says a report in oilprice.com.  “…..the only common theme being that all four expect demand to grow compared to 2022, but all are less optimistic than they were a year or so ago.  The OPEC Secretariat is the most optimistic, and has predicted that demand will grow by some 2.3 million barrels per day while the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees demand expanding by 2.0 mb/d. On the lower end of the spectrum, Standard Chartered is the least optimistic, and sees demand growing only 1.3 mb/d while U.S.-based Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects growth to clock in at 1.4 mb/d.”  China lithium  China’s lithium market maybe close to a bottom after a 66 percent collapse in prices over the last five months, reports mining.com.  “The declines came as companies across the battery supply chain avoided high prices by drawing on inventory rather than buying afresh, while the end to Chinese subsidies on EVs and a price war among automakers curtailed demand. Although the slump has offered some relief to downstream customers, the mineral is still over four times more expensive than the low hit in 2020.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/short-call-lets-talk-of-angel-one-costly-deposits-and-why-market-operators-are-glum-despite-rally-10429261.html

Vaidyanathan, after announcing the bank’s January-March 2023 quarterly results, in a post-results analyst call said that because of the change of regulators, they have gone to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) for its approval.  &quot;We think it is June or possibly in July, which is where we think the timeframe is as we speak, given where we are on various things,&quot; said Vaidyanathan.  HDFC Ltd had received approval letters including from Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and Competition Commission of India as well as from India's stock exchanges BSE and the National Stock Exchange.  Also read: Merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank secures the NCLT green light  “We've made the application to the Securities and Exchange Board of India as it relates to the change in promoter and giving notices to mutual fund orders, so we've gone to SEBI to get their permission.

After seeking approvals from all the regulators, Vaidyanathan said, “we will circle back with the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) to take it to the final stages”.  The merger  The merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank has been in the news for a while.

However, higher fees including TPD and lower credit cost led to in-line profitability, at Rs120bn (up 20% YoY). Overall credit growth for the bank was moderate, at 17% YoY/6% QoQ, due to some pulldown in retail credit growth (21% YoY) during 4Q, with its portfolio share at 46%. However, deposit growth came in strong (Rs1.5trn) at 21% YoY/9% QoQ, after a sub-optimal growth in 3Q on the back of healthy retail deposit growth in the run up to the merger. Overall NIM stood at 4.3% in 4Q, but the recent deposit acceleration may keep NIMs in check as the full impact is yet to play out. We have slightly cut our FY24E earnings, by 1%, factoring-in the elevated costs, but expect the standalone bank to deliver a superior RoA/RoE of 2%/17-18% over FY24-26E. Bank expects the merger to complete by July 2023, once RBI approval is in place which we believe will be critical from the point of view of the merger’s structure, including clarity on HDFC Life stake/merger of NBFC subsidiaries and regulatory dispensations, if any.  Outlook Notwithstanding the merger-related regulatory overhang, we believe HDFCB offers the best play on India’s consumption story and is also a good defensive bet in current choppy waters. We retain a long-term BUY, with revised TP of Rs2,050/share vs Rs1,925 (valuing the core bank at 3x Mar-25E ABV) and a subs valuation of Rs87/share.

The private lender has reported 21 percent year on year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 12,594.5 crore.  HDFC Bank posted a 20.3 percent YoY growth in consolidated net revenue at Rs 34,552.8 crore during the quarter against Rs 28,733.9 crore recorded in the year-ago quarter.  Net interest income (NII), or the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 23.7 percent to Rs 23,351 crore from Rs 18,872 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, HDFC Bank said in an exchange filing on April 15.  Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company after the March quarter earnings:  Motilal Oswal  HDFC Bank reported an in-line quarter with healthy growth in NII, even as margins remained stable, while core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growth remained modest. Loan growth was driven by sustained momentum in the retail segment and robust growth in commercial and rural banking.  Asset quality ratios remained robust, while the restructured book moderated to 31bp of loans. Healthy PCR and a contingent provisioning buffer should support asset quality.  The broking house upheld its earnings projection and estimates the bank to deliver a ~19 percent PAT CAGR over FY23-25, with RoA/RoE of 2.0 percent/17.7 percent in FY25.  The brokerage reiterated its “buy” rating with a target price of Rs 1,950 (premised on 3.0x Sep'24E ABV). A potential pick up on the margins and progress on the merger would be the key monitorables.  Prabhudas Lilladher  HDFC Bank saw a mixed quarter. While core PAT at Rs 120.8 billion was in-line, core PPoP missed broking firm estimates by 4.4 percent due to weak NII which, was offset by lower operating expenses (opex) and provisions.  Asset yields were below estimates likely due to loans being booked towards the quarter end.  The bank wants to maintain its current net interest margins (NIM), as the funding cost rise would be offset by the fixed rate loans (45 percent of book). Retail wholesale mix improved QoQ from 44:56 to 47:53. Retail deposit accretion was healthy (+7.5 percent QoQ) and its share is now 83 percent (80 percent in March 2022).  The bank added 1,479 branches in FY23 and this run rate would continue in FY24E. However, the key highlight is the bank’s balance sheet, which is merger ready as suggested by high cash and other assets that in the short term could drag NIM, said the broking firm.  Maintaining multiple at 3.0x, and roll forward to FY25E core ABV, it raised the target price from Rs 1,850 to Rs 1,925 while retaining the “buy” rating. Valuation is at 2.6x FY25 core ABV.  Bernstein  The broking firm has kept an “outperform” rating on the Mumbai-headquartered lender and has set a target price of Rs 2,200 a share.  The bank's Q4FY23 performance met expectations and it is prepared for a merger, its analysts said in a report.  The report, however, also noted that the bank's EPS growth was limited due to a flat NIM and a spike in operating expenses, with an unchanged return on assets (RoA) compared to FY22.  UBS  The broking firm has maintained a “buy” rating, with a target price of Rs 1,900 a share. The report notes that HDFC Bank's Q4 results were in-line and it was getting ready for a merger.  However, the report mentions that some metrics were in-line, while lower treasury, higher operating expenses, and provisions led to a PAT miss. The report also highlights strong retail deposits and a decline in slippages, while the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) continues to fall.  The bank’s management expects stable NIMs and a higher cost-to-income (CI) ratio in FY24. The merger is expected to complete by July 2023, according to management.  The report notes that the peaking of the interest rate cycle and a fall in incremental system LDR could be a positive for the bank.  CLSA  According to a CLSA report, the bank's NII was in line, but PPoP was a miss due to operating expenses (opex). However, the report said credit costs are expected to offset high opex in FY24. The report also notes that deposits and loan mix were positive from Q4.  There was a high opex growth and asset quality provides a cushion to the bank's profit and loss (P&amp;amp;L).

HDFC,2023-04-14T12:35:46+05:30,Shivam Shukla,A change in India Inc corner office occupants doesn't really matter much for stock prices,"What will be the impact of new CEOs for the likes of TCS, Kotak &amp; SBI? Jefferies decodes the impact on stock performance through a sample of 72 CEO transitions","A number of large corporations, including Kotak Bank, SBI, HUL, TCS, ICICI Pru, Tech Mahindra and HDFC, constituting a market cap of around $465 billion, or 21 percent of the Nifty weight and 17 percent of total FII holdings, are set to see a change in the corner office over the next 12 months.  Several large-cap companies such as HUL, TCS, Tech Mahindra, and ICICI Pru have announced changes in the rank of the chief executive offer (CEO) over the last few weeks. This makes a complete U-turn in the trend observed during the Covid period when too few transitions were recorded in the CEO rank.  Businesses are now dealing with a changed macro environment and geopolitical situations that make CEO changes more likely. Certain companies such as Reliance Industries have even started generational changes in leadership.  TCS leads the league of Nifty50 behemoths where the corner office sees change in occupants this year. While Krithivasan will take over as CEO and MD of TCS from June 1, HUL will have Rohit Jawa as the new CEO and MD by June 27.  Some corner offices will vacant this year because of the end of term of the reigning chief executives. Uday Kotak’s tenure as the MD and CEO of Kotak Bank will end by December 31 and Dinesh Khara’s term will be up for renewal at SBI in October. Whereas HDFC Limited will have a new CEO and MD in Sashidhar Jagdishan after the twins merge.  Assessing the Impact  Jefferies India stumbled upon surprising results as it picked up 72 CEO transitions to assess the impact of the change in the high chair. The 'zero date' was defined as one month prior to the actual announcement of the CEO change. According to the analysis, in 53 percent of the cases, the trend in the stock price did not change around the time of the transition.  In cases where there was a change, 68 percent of them were for the better, which means an underperforming stock became outperforming in six months, with a split between internal and external hires.  External hires seemed to have made a positive difference in the stock price trends in many cases. Among the 72 transitions analysed, less than 40 percent of large-caps replaced CEOs with external hires, while 55 percent of smaller-cap companies chose to hire externally.  Among sectors, it was found that the changes in CEOs triggered a disproportionate change in Staples where five out of seven saw a change in relative performance. In non-bank financials, it was eight out of 10, but practically none in consumer discretionary with only one out of 10.  The study suggests that CEO transitions do not necessarily require investors to re-look at their portfolios. However, it is important to note that this analysis only looked at the impact of CEO transitions over a six-month period from the 'zero date'. Over longer terms, other factors can influence stock performance and must be taken into account, Jefferies mentioned.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/a-change-in-india-inc-corner-office-occupants-doesnt-really-matter-much-for-stock-prices-10411241.html

HDFC,2023-04-06T15:45:09+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Ten stocks gear up to deliver up to 15% returns as RBI slams brakes on rate hikes,"With the rate pause, there will be some respite for large debt companies, growth stocks, small and mid-cap space companies, and specific sectors like consumer durables and real estate in the medium term","The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India has decided to retain the repo rate at 6.5 percent with a 5:1 majority focussing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth.  The total repo rate hike by the RBI since May 2022 was 250 basis points with the objective of bringing inflation down to its target of 4 percent (+/- 2 percent).  Some experts expected one last rate hike of 25 bps, while others had forecast a long pause to assess the impact of earlier rate hikes on growth.  “This is in line with our expectations and possibly a best-case scenario and positive for the markets. The RBI has remained prudent as it evaluates the comprehensive effect of rate hikes that we saw over the last year,” said Divam Sharma, founder of Green Portfolio PMS.  Food inflation is a matter of grave concern for the RBI and it is willing to bend over backwards to slow inflation and get it back to the tolerance band, he said.  The RBI raised its growth forecast to 6.5 percent from 6.4 percent earlier, while the inflation forecast for the current financial year was lowered to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent earlier, assuming an annual average crude oil price (Indian basket) of $85 per barrel and a normal monsoon.  But it feels the lag in the passthrough of input costs could keep core inflation elevated. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 6.44 percent in February compared with 6.52 percent in the previous month.  Anil Rego, founder of Right Horizons PMS, said the unchanged stance signals that the RBI is confident of its projections and expects inflation to cool gradually.  Hence, Divam said there will be some respite for large debt companies, growth stocks, small and mid-cap space companies, and specific sectors like consumer durables and real estate in the medium term, thanks to the RBI’s decision to not hike rates.  The benchmark stock indices extended their upward journey for the fifth consecutive session amid volatility, with the BSE Sensex rising almost 52 points to 59,741 levels and the Nifty 50 climbing 19 points to 17,576 levels, at 14:01 hours IST.  Here is a list of rate-sensitive stocks that experts said can return up to 15 percent in the short term. The returns are based on the closing prices of April 5.  Expert: Viraj Vyas, technical &amp;amp; derivatives analyst, institutional equity, at Ashika Stock Broking  AAVAS Financiers: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,672 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,580 | Target: Rs 1,900 | Return: 14 percent  The stock has been languishing since January 2022 and is trading in a falling wedge pattern. Usually, this is a reversal pattern (bullish in this context). The RSI (relative strength index) has given a positive divergence, as highlighted in the chart.  Although there is no strength now, the stock presents a low-risk-high-reward probability. After crossing Rs 1,730, some bullishness can push the stock towards Rs 1,900.  ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 840 | Target: Rs 980 | Return: 11 percent  The stock has endured a corrective leg from November 2022 and although it broke away from the falling trendline, the stock has not witnessed any follow-through beyond the Rs 880-875 zone.  Also read: MPC keeps repo rate unchanged, raises GDP growth forecast: 10 key takeaways  The stock is consolidating in a narrow range of Rs 815-875 and a sustained breakout above Rs 880 is likely to inspire a move towards Rs 940-920.  Recent volume activity too shows stronger buyer interest near the breakout, making a high probability bullish setup provided it sustains above Rs 840-850.    AU Small Finance Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 558 | Stop-Loss: Rs 585 | Target: Rs 540 | Return: 3 percent  The stock has broadly consolidated time- and price-wise since August 2021 and until recently, started forming lower highs and lower lows, breaking below the trendline around the Rs 600 mark.  The stock since then has headed towards Rs 585 and beyond, which shows bearish intent. On the RSI indicator, the stock is at 36, which denotes that it has been forming more lower lows and is in a bearish grip.    Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities  ICICI Lombard General Insurance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,093 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,049 | Target: Rs 1,178 | Return: 8 percent  In mid-March, the stock registered a new 52-week low of Rs 1,049 and moved sideways thereafter. A bullish divergence in short-term indicators signals that the stock may bounce back, utilising the prior consolidation.  On the higher side, the stock may face a hurdle at around its prior point of polarity (Rs 1,116). As per the current set-up, the stock may surpass that hurdle easily and could move towards its 200-day SMA (simple moving average) of Rs 1,178.  In case of a decline, the stock will find support around its 52-week low.    Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 990 | Stop Loss: Rs 940 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 11 percent  After a falling channel breakout, the stock retested its extended upper band and resumed the up-move. Continuing its prior daily rising trend, the stock rose to a one-and-half-month closing high on April 5.  Key technical indicators are in favour of the bulls in the medium term as well as the short-term timeframe charts.  The stock has the potential to move towards its 200-day SMA of Rs 1,039 initially and the psychological level of Rs 1,100 subsequently.  On the lower side, the stock may respect the extended upper band of the channel.    PFC: Buy | LTP: Rs 157 | Stop Loss: Rs 149 | Target: Rs 172 | Return: 10 percent  In the last week, the stock respected its upward sloping 20-week EMA (exponential moving average) and breached its prior falling trend. Later, the stock extended gains and rose to a 12-day closing high.  The positive momentum may continue, which could lead the stock towards its long-term hurdle zone of Rs 168-172. The key technical indicators reversed from the oversold zone and gave buy signals.  In case of any decline, the stock may find intermediate support at around its 50-day EMA, which is currently Rs 150.    Expert: Rohan Shah, Head of Technical Analyst at Stoxbox  ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 854 | Target: Rs 955 | Return: 8 percent  The stock plunged about 16 percent from a life high, declining from Rs 958 to Rs 796 in late January, after which it traded in a tight range. In this process, the stock recently witnessed a potential breakout from the Master Candle Pattern, with the price moving above the 20-week EMA after a good amount of time, highlighting a bullish momentum.  Also, the price decline was arrested at around its previous resistance level, which denotes polarity into play and highlights a robust price structure. Momentum indicator RSI has surpassed 50 levels with a bullish crossover, validating the bullish bias in the price.  Thes stock has the potential to scale higher towards Rs 930, followed by Rs 955, with a protective stop-loss of Rs 854.    Aditya Birla Capital: Buy | LTP: Rs 155 | Stop-Loss: Rs 146 | Target: Rs 173 | Return: 12 percent  The pattern analysis on the weekly charts exhibits a stage-2 breakout, followed by a potential base in the making. It witnessed a shakeout during the base formation and continued to hover above the breakout zone, which evinces another modest accumulation at elevated levels.  The accumulation base forming a potential Darvas box is captivating, while it trades a hair's breadth away from the ceiling near Rs 162.45.  It also shows a strong relative performance compared to the head index, which showcases further strength in the price action. We anticipate a potential upside till Rs 173 against a stop-loss of Rs 146.    Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 5,761 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,000 | Target: Rs 4,920 | Return: 15 percent  The stock has been under pressure for many weeks, and the price has tumbled more than 25 percent since its September 2022 highs. On the price pattern front, the stock has registered a breakdown from a contracting triangle pattern, which denotes that the dominance of bears is likely to persist.  The stock has been trading below all key daily moving averages (20, 50, 100, 200), which indicates a bearish trend and lack of strength. For the past couple of weeks, the price has been consolidating at a 38.2 percent retracement level (Rs 5,650) from its prior advance from Rs 1,783 to Rs 8,050.  We sense another round of selloff once the price decisively trades below Rs 5,650. Going ahead, if the price trades below the mentioned levels, it will open the way for Rs 5,335 and Rs 4,920, with a stop-loss of Rs 6,000.    Expert: Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,615 | Target: Rs 1,725-1,776 | Return: 7 percent  The stock has given a swing high breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in bullish bets. Besides, the stock has moved above the critical moving average on the daily timeframe.  The momentum oscillator RSI (14) is in a bullish crossover. Over the short term, the stock is likely to move towards a higher level. On the higher end, resistance is visible at Rs 1,725, above which further upside movement can happen. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 1,615.    Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 427 | Stop-Loss: Rs 417 | Target: Rs 445-460 | Return: 8 percent  The stock has given a falling trendline breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in optimism. Besides, the stock has moved above the 200 DMA, which points towards a positive trend.  The momentum indicator is in a bullish crossover. Over the short term, the stock is likely to move towards Rs 460. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 417.

HDFC,2023-03-29T21:19:57+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"Aditya Puri talks about his next interest, reveals why he accepted a pay cut to join HDFC Bank","The veteran banker stated that his goal is to make a difference in people's lives, particularly those in rural India. ","Anita &quot;Smiley&quot; Puri's book, &quot;Adityanama&quot; - The Man Behind the Banker Unveiled, was published in February and provides a unique insight into the life of her husband, former HDFC Bank MD &amp;amp; CEO Aditya Puri.  In an exclusive conversation with CNBC-TV18, Anita Puri talked about lesser-known details and Aditya Puri, the family man. And, former HDFC Bank boss Aditya Puri spoke on a range of topics including learnings as a banker, lessons in leadership, life beyond banking, and how he wants to move into the next phase.  Aditya Puri does not want to write his own book, but he may associate himself with a company interested in finance or pharmaceuticals.  The veteran banker stated that his goal is to make a difference in people's lives, particularly those in rural India. He also stated he is keen to work on a project and eliminate the necessity for moneylenders.  &quot;If there was something where I could eliminate the moneylender I would do that,&quot; the veteran banker said.  If we could see him diving a company in an active role, he said, &quot;If I find something like PharmEasy there, I am actively involved. So just like banking needed to go into the interior. We need to get quality healthcare and medicines to the interior you drive wherever you go to your own village.&quot;  He continued, &quot;I do want to bring quality healthcare to all of India at a cheaper price delivered to the doorstep. That includes medicines, orthopedics, doctor on call! And I'm very passionate about that. I want to. And we are working, a couple of us are working together - the Mahindras, us, Bombay Port Trust, the government, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank to make your life more liveable. I think we will be able to come out with something soon.&quot;  He stated that he would like to actively enter some company when the time comes. &quot;If there was something where I could eliminate the moneylender I would do that.&quot; He added, &quot;we have the opportunity to be able to take finance and thereby take them out of the money lending business. I think that that is something that must be done. And if you give them finance, I think it will create another India,&quot; he said.  Anita Puri recalled the difficult days when Aditya Puri switched from Citi Bank in Kuala Lumpur to HDFC Bank in Mumbai, stating that they had to make significant lifestyle changes because Citi Bank was already established while HDFC Bank was a newborn.  On the big career move from Citi to HDFC Bank, Aditya Puri said it was a difficult decision and recalled what he told Anita, &quot;One day, I'll set up a bank in India that India will be proud of.&quot;  Revealing why he decided to accept a pay cut to join HDFC Bank and the conversation he had with Chairman Deepak Parekh, he said, &quot;And the salary offered me, I was almost going to fall off the chair. I said, “Deepak are you bloody joking? What are we going to do?” Then I also said, “Look, if I come back, it will be to solve a passion. So whose bank will it be? How much will you run it?” And he said, “Look, you come back and you run it.”  &quot;And I have to say, he never deviated from that. If I needed to do something, or if I needed his help, I went to him. But he never once said you do this or you do that. You have to give that credit to him. He said 'Look, come back to the country and do something',” Aditya Puri added.  Speaking on the most challenging moment for him when he was managing the HDFC Bank, he said, there were a lot of challenges, explained that they had to first set it up, and then had to see if we needed to expand and become large, how he needed to change the business due to ongoing technological advancements, geographical aspects, etc, and added: &quot;we wanted to be ahead of the curve. So being the first also entails risks&quot;.  On the world's banking problems and whether India is doing things correctly, he remarked, &quot;If you see these collapses, and if you see also what the banking systems overseas look like, we look like a Garden of Eden.&quot;  Reacting to Silicon Valley Bank and other bank collapses in the US, he gave full credit to the RBI and highlighted our asset liability management rules, portfolio management rules, and deposit regulations, among others. He opined, &quot;I think we do a damn good job, and the rest need to learn from us rather than lecture us. And I also believe that the “sone ki chidiya” is coming back.&quot;  ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/aditya-puri-talks-about-his-next-interest-reveals-why-he-accepted-a-pay-cut-to-join-hdfc-bank-10333301.html

As part of the plan, HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger.  ","The merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and HDFC Bank, expected to take effect from June-July, will lead to bigger growth opportunities for the combined entity, HDFC Vice Chairman and CEO, Keki Mistry told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on 10 March.  “Gradually, the objective is to expand housing loans from more and more branches of the bank. The growth opportunity on housing loans will be bigger in HDFC Bank (the combined entity) than HDFC,” said Mistry.  HDFC on April 4 said its board has approved the merger of its wholly-owned subsidiaries HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited with HDFC Bank Limited. As part of the plan, HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger.  Mistry said the lower regulatory costs for the merger at this point was one of the key reasons that led to the timing of the merger.  “It is not the vanishing regulatory arbitrage that led to the merger. We have time and again looked at the merger but the regulatory cost was high (earlier). Advantage of the merger was always there. Over the last 7-8 years, regulatory cost has come down for merger and benefits of the merger became stronger,” Mistry said.  Earlier, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had cited the vanishing regulatory arbitrage as one of the reasons that led to the merger.  “Every new RBI policy entailed tightening of regulations for NBFCs,” Parekh told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on January 27 . “So, the flexibility and the light-touch regulation that an NBFC enjoyed was fast disappearing, and rightly so, because a number of NBFCs had collapsed and some had even taken public deposits,” the veteran banker said.

But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders. On its part, the RBI has been encouraging large NBFCs to convert into banks, after the shadow lending space was shaken by the IL&amp;amp;FS crisis in 2018.  Not to take any executive role in the bank  Mistry said he will not take any executive role in the bank but could look at joining the board.  “I will not take any executive role in the bank,” said Mistry in the interview.  Earlier, there were speculations that Mistry might take up an executive role in the merged entity.  Replying to a question on whether the company has identified the person to head the mortgage portfolio, Mistry said non decision has been taken so far. “It's still being worked out. We have an integration committee looking at this,” Mistry said.  In the interview, Mistry said the demand for housing loans is expected to remain strong gong ahead despite high interest rates environment. “There is a sustained demand for housing loans.

HDFC,2023-02-22T14:41:17+05:30,Manish M. Suvarna,"Bank asset quality to improve on expected fall in fresh slippages, say analysts","The gross bad loans of scheduled commercial banks reduced to 4.5 percent as of December 31, 2022 from 6.6 percent in the year-ago period","The asset quality of Indian banks is expected to improve, aided by a fall in fresh slippages, analysts have said.  “Asset quality will improve as banks continue to provide for existing gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and incremental slippages also continue the downward trend,” said Jindal Haria, director-financial institutions, at India Ratings and Research.  A loan becomes an NPA when interest or the principal amount is not paid for 90 days. Slippage refers to the fresh addition of bad loans.  As per a CareEdge Ratings report, the gross NPAs of scheduled commercial banks fell 19.7 percent to Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of December 31, 2022, from Rs 7.5 lakh crore in the year-ago period. The gross NPA ratio reduced to 4.5 percent from 6.6 percent.  The gross NPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks is expected to reduce in FY24 due to lower incremental slippages, a reduction in special mention account books &amp;amp; restructuring portfolios, and healthy growth in advances, said Sanjay Agarwal, senior director at CareEdge Ratings.  Also read: Bank of Maharashtra tops list of public sector lenders in loan growth, asset quality  Write-offs  According to CareEdge, the gross NPAs of public sector banks reduced by 17.9 percent on-year to Rs 4.6 lakh crore in the third quarter of the current financial year due to steady recoveries and upgrades, higher write-offs and lower slippages.  Their write-offs increased by 25.2 percent on-year to Rs 29,000 crore from Rs 23,000 crore in Q3 of FY22 and fresh slippages declined by 12 percent. A loan is written off when there is no hope of recovery from the borrower. Banks need to make full provisions for written-off assets.  “Banks are not expecting significant slippages from the 1.4 percent restructured portfolio,” Haria said.  Most banks reported an improvement in bad loan numbers in the third quarter.  State Bank of India reported 3.14 percent gross NPAs and 0.77 percent net NPAs, lower than 4.5 percent gross NPAs and 1.34 percent net NPAs a year earlier.  Bank of Baroda reported 4.53 percent gross NPAs and 0.99 percent NPAs, sharply lower than last year’s figures.  Also read: Rs 3.54 lakh crore of investor money gone!

I think there's room for it to come down substantially,” he said.

Apart from executing transactions in no network areas, such a facility will be of help in urban pockets experiencing bad networks and also in aircraft, according to a statement.  It can be noted that there is a facility which helps users with feature phones undertake Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions.  HDFC Bank has begun the pilot in a partnership with Crunchfish, IDFC Bank and M2P Fintech under the RBI's regulatory sandbox programme after getting the nod in September 2022, it said.  The lender will roll-out this service as part of a limited pilot for four months in more than 16 cities and towns across the country. The offline transaction amount would be limited to up to Rs 200 per transaction.  Digital payment typically requires one either the customer or the merchant to be online to get executed. The pilot is attempting to ensure that a transaction goes even when both customer and merchant are fully offline, the statement said.  As soon as either the merchant or the customer goes online, the transaction gets settled, the statement said.  &quot;This innovation will accelerate financial inclusion in remote areas by enabling adoption of digital payments as both merchants and customers can do transactions without any network,&quot; the bank's country head for payments business Parag Rao, said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/hdfc-bank-begins-offline-payment-pilot-under-rbi-sandbox-10071721.html

HDFC,2023-02-08T13:33:43+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,RBI raises repo by 25 bps: Check buy &amp; sell ideas for 10 rate-sensitive stocks,"The monetary policy acts with lags, it may take 3-4 quarters for the policy rate to be transmitted to the real economy, and the peak effect may take as long as 5-6 quarters, said Dhiraj Relli of HDFC Securities.","The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India on February 8 raised the repo rate by 25 bps to 6.5 percent with a 4:2 majority.  India's headline inflation, excluding vegetables, has been rising well above the upper tolerance band and may remain elevated, especially with high core inflation pressures, though the consumer price inflation eased for the third straight month in December.  The rate hike decision was as per the most of expectations by market participants. The January CPI inflation is scheduled to be announced on February 14.  According to the MPC, inflation remains a major risk to the outlook. Hence, the rate-setting panel is of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break core inflation persistence and thereby strengthen medium-term growth prospects.  And, it decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.  &quot;Resilient high-frequency indicators and continued rate hikes by global central banks could have spurred the MPC action even as headline inflation has shown some signs of moderation. Rate hike of 25bps seems justified on the back of high persistent sticky core inflation - above 6 percent - to keep the inflation expectations anchored,&quot; Dhiraj Relli, MD and CEO at HDFC Securities, said.  The monetary policy acts with lags, it may take three-four quarters for the policy rate to be transmitted to the real economy, and the peak effect may take as long as five-six quarters, Relli feels.  After frontloaded rate hikes since May 2022, he said there could be a strong case now to put a brake on monetary tightening. Further rate hikes beyond 6.5 percent could pose an unwarranted risk to economic growth unless inflationary pressures re-emerge, he feels.  The market has reacted positively to the policy statement, with the BSE Sensex rising 376 points to 60,662, and the Nifty50 jumping 133 points to 17,854, at 1:02pm.  The Reserve Bank of India lowered its CPI inflation forecast for FY23 to 6.5 percent from 6.7 percent and sees 5.3 percent for FY24.  On the growth front, real GDP growth is estimated by the RBI at 6.4 percent for FY24 and the same has been raised to 7 percent for FY23 from 6.8 percent earlier, making India one of fastest growing economies.  &quot;The risk of over-tightening always exists, however, we believe growth over inflation will take the centre stage for the RBI as the world passes through a sluggish growth phase, while the US and Europe continue with measured quantitative tightening,&quot; of Kunal Valia, Chief Investment Officer - Listed Investments at Waterfield Advisors, said.  The rate hike is going to add to the cost of capital and loans are going to become dearer, he feels.  Follow LIVE updates of the RBI MPC monetary policy announcement here  We have collated a list of rate-sensitive stocks that experts say can give healthy return over the next three-six months. Returns are calculated based on the closing price of February 7.  Expert: Viraj Vyas, Technical &amp;amp; Derivatives Analyst - Institutional Equity at Ashika Stock Broking  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,565 | Target: Rs 1,800 | Return: 9 percent  After the strong spike in price seen in the second week of November 2022, the stock has since consolidated and is showing signs of accumulation.  A move beyond Rs 1,670-1,680 is likely to spark further bullish momentum towards life highs. On the weekly chart, the stock appears to have formed a high and tight flag which is bullish continuation pattern.    Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,160 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,830 | Target: Rs 6,750 | Return: 10 percent  On the daily timeframe, the stock is trading above its 21-day EMA (exponential moving average). On the weekly chart, stock is consolidating in a triangle pattern since April 2021.  The stock has rebounded fairly well after touching the upward sloping trendline. We expect the stock to behave in a similar manner and move towards a fresh supply zone.    Poonawalla Fincorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 300 | Stop-Loss: Rs 285 | Target: Rs 340 | Return: 13 percent  After the V-shaped recovery seen during December 2022, the stock has broadly consolidated in a channel. Volume spikes were up on days when the stock was positive and strong volume participation was seen in the last session too.  The current pattern is similar to a 'Flag and Pole' which is a bullish continuation pattern.    Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi  Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,775 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,719 | Target: Rs 1,850 | Return: 4 percent  After making the top of Rs 1,997.55, the said counter has been continuously falling, resulting in a 16 percent correction. Currently, it has taken support in the zone of Rs 1,700-1,725 (which is also its historical support).  During the last few trading sessions, Kotak Bank has displayed multiple bullish candlesticks patterns (a couple of Doji's followed by a massive Bullish Engulfing structure) hinting at a possible bullish reversal.  From the indicator point of view, daily MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has made a bullish cross along with daily RSI (relative strength index) has violated its 3-month-old trendline thus confirming our bullish stance in Kotak Bank.  One can buy in the range of Rs 1,760-1,780 in small tranches and another around Rs 1,740-1,750 (if again tested), with upside target at around Rs 1,850 and with a stop-loss of Rs 1,719.    Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,160 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,975 | Target: Rs 6,500 | Return: 5.5 percent  After making the top of Rs 7,778, the said counter has been relentlessly falling which resulted in a 27 percent cut in price. Looks like it has stabilized near Rs 5,800, which is a crucial support for coming to a few sessions.  During the last few trading sessions, the said counter has witnessed nice buying interest along with volume coming in. Also double bottom is formed around Rs 5,900 level accompanied by a bullish divergence on daily RSI which are hinting at a possible bullish reversal.  One can buy in the range of Rs 6,130-6,165. The upside target is expected around Rs 6,500, with a stop-loss of Rs 5,975/    Tata Motors: Sell | LTP: Rs 435.45 | Stop-Loss: 455 | Target: Rs 415 | Return: 5 percent  Since last month, the said counter has been making a higher top and higher bottom which resulted in a whopping 22 percent return. One needs to be alert as of now because it has made a Dark Cloud Cover pattern followed by a trio of doji-like (refer to the chart) structures exactly at its historical resistance zone of Rs 455-460 which hints towards some profit in the coming few sessions.  On indicator front, daily MACD is overstretched along with daily RSI and has made an impulsive structure near 70 level which is a matter of concern and could be an early sign of bearishness in Tata Motors.  One should book profit in the range of Rs 435-440. Fresh buy is not advised as of now.    Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital  Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra Financial Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 267.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 249 | Target: Rs 320 | Return: 20 percent  The stock is trading at a 52-week high, which tells that the stock already is in strong momentum.  A recent breakout from a rectangle pattern, along with a gap and increased trading volume, confirms the trend's continuation to the upside.  The opening of Bollinger bands on the daily timeframe suggests rising volatility in support of an upward move.  The RSI on the daily timeframe has also demonstrated a breakout, reflecting sustained momentum in the stock's prices.  Going ahead we expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 320, where the stop-loss must be Rs 249 on the closing basis.    Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 781.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 730 | Target: Rs 865 | Return: 11 percent  After September 2022, Cholamandalam Investment now has got into the formation of Higher Highs, Higher Lows. This shows the positive undertone of the prices.  On the daily time frame, the stock has given a bearish channel pattern breakout, which confirms the reversal.  The stock has given a breakout of the Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern on February 1, 2023 which points towards the beginning of the trend to the upside.  The breakout is confirmed as it is accompanied by huge volumes and a Gap.  The stock is hovering near Upper Bollinger band which illustrate the rising volatility of the prices.  RSI on the weekly timeframe as well as on the daily timeframe is sustaining above 50 levels which shows that the prices have strong momentum in it.  We recommend traders and investors to buy this stock for the target of Rs 865 where the stop-loss must be Rs 730 on the closing basis.    HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,550 | Target: Rs 1,780 | Return: 8 percent  The multi-month breakout in the ratio charts of HDFC Bank against its benchmark index Bank Nifty on January 18, 2023 illustrates the outperformance.  Furthermore, the presence of higher volumes during upward price movements and lower volumes during downward price movements suggests that the demand for the stock is stronger than the supply. This can be seen as a positive signal as it may indicate that the stock has strong buying interest and that price increases are likely to be sustained.  The stock is demonstrating favourable technical signals, as multiple key moving averages, including the 50, 100, and 200-day are below prices which confirms the up move.  RSI on the weekly timeframe is sustaining above 60 mark reflecting presence of momentum for potential up move.  We recommend traders and investors to buy this stock for the target of Rs 1,780 where the stop-loss must be Rs 1,550 the closing basis.    Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities  Power Finance Corporation: Sell | LTP: Rs 143 | Stop-Loss: Rs 168 | Target: Rs 105 | Return: 27 percent  The stock respected its prior highs (Rs 139 and Rs 154) connecting rising trendline, as it reversed after testing that line (Rs 162) and moved towards its 20-week EMA (Rs 133) quite rapidly. Later, the stock witnessed a pullback after testing its 20-week EMA.  Bearish divergence on its weekly RSI and negative cross-over on MACD signals that the stock may resume its down move, wherein a stable move below its 20-week EMA (Rs 134) will accelerate the negative momentum. This could drag the stock towards Rs 110-105 zone in the medium-term.  In case of any rebound, its prior high connecting rising trendline (Rs 168) will cap the up-move. Fresh short position can be initiated at current juncture and on rise for a desired action.  L&amp;amp;T Finance Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 65 | Target: Rs 155 | Return: 73 percent  Since late-November 2022, the stock majorly ended last week above its long-term moving average (200-week SMA). We believe the stock is poised for a symmetrical triangle breakout, which could take it towards the breakout point of Rs 155 in the medium-term.  So far, the stock moved upwards taking support of its intermediate rising trendline. Its weekly RSI is positively poised above 50-mark since later-October 2022.  In case of major decline, the stock may find support around its lower band of symmetrical triangle pattern, which is currently placed at around Rs 65. Fresh long position can be initiated at current juncture and further after a breakout for an expected line of movement.

HDFC,2023-01-30T10:12:25+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Top 10 ideas to trade in Feb series as bears get hold of Dalal Street,"Experts predict a lot of volatility given the Union Budget week, but if the Nifty manages to hold the 50 WEMA, then there are fair chances that the index can easily surpass the 17,800-18,200 zone in the coming days, followed by 18,500","With the breaking of month-long consolidation range, bears have taken charge of Dalal Street ahead of the Union Budget. In fact, it was a disheartening start to the February series on January 27 and, as a result, the market shed more than 2 percent in the passing week.  The Nifty50 closed at more than four-month low of 17,604, breaking out of the strong support at 17,800 held for a month amid consolidation and posting the biggest weekly loss since the week ended December 23.  The next support lies at 50 WEMA (weekly exponential moving average) of 17,400 after breaking the short-term moving averages of 9, 20 and 21 weeks. Experts hope to see a lot of volatility given the Union Budget week, but if the Nifty manages to hold the 50 WEMA, then there are fair chances that the index can easily surpass the 17,800-18,200 zone in the coming days, followed by 18,500.  &quot;From an optimist point of view, it’s good that the market is approaching this event (Budget 2023) on a lighter note and any favourable outcome would lift the markets higher. On the other hand, a slight disappointment would lead to further aberration in the market,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  &quot;Considering the ‘positive divergence’ in the ‘RSI-smoothened’ oscillator, we may expect some recovery from lower levels,&quot; he said.  He feels 17,700 – 17,800 are to be seen as strong hurdles. If the market has to regain strength as well as confidence, Nifty needs to surpass 18,000 on a closing basis.  The market expert advised traders to keep a note of all these scenarios and should ideally remain light ahead of the event.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 27 closing prices:  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Reliance Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,337 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 | Target: Rs 2,700 | Return: 15 percent  For the past 8 months, the stock has been in a wide trading range of Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,700. Whenever the market falls to extreme levels, Reliance falls on the lower boundary of the bearish parallel. On the other hand, Reliance was at Rs 2,700 whenever the market touched 18,500 level.  After a period of 4 months, the stock has again fallen to the level of Rs 2,300. Based on the logic of the bullish parallel channel, contra traders should be buyers at current levels and more on the downside around Rs 2,250. However, it requires a final stop-loss at Rs 2,150. On the upside, Rs 2,440, Rs 2,550 and Rs 2,700 would be major barriers.    Titan Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,331 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 | Target: Rs 2,600 | Return: 11 percent  From the lows of July 2022, the stock displayed a spectacular rally. It was at Rs 1,800 level and moved to Rs 2,790 in a period of 4 months, which is significant.  In the last 3 months, the stock is displaying a corrective move and has hit the support of 50 percent retracement ratio of the entire rally of Rs 1,000 points.  The positional/Contra traders should be buyers at current levels and more on dips at Rs 2,230. Place a stop-loss at Rs 2,150, which is slightly below the retracement level of 61.80 percent. Hurdles would be Rs 2,500 and Rs 2,600.    HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,616 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,500 | Target: Rs 1,750 | Return: 8 percent  The stock remained well above Rs 1,600-1,550 levels in last 3 months. In fact, whenever the stock dropped to Rs 1,600 or Rs 1,550 levels, it was quickly bought up.  In the last three days, Bank Nifty and bank stocks declined vertically, however, HDFC Bank remained the least loser.  Technically, we should be positional buyers between Rs 1,600 and Rs 1,550. Keep stop-loss at Rs 1,500. On the upside, the stock may decline towards Rs 1,680 or Rs 1,750 levels.    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 346 | Stop-Loss: Rs 334 | Target: Rs 367 | Return: 6 percent  The stock has recently seen a corrective phase where prices have corrected from the high of Rs 361 to Rs 325. The stock has now given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance and has seen a gradual increase in volumes along with the price upmove.  The prices have also managed to show relative strength in the volatile markets during last week. The RSI (relative strength index) oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum and hence, we expect an upmove in the stock in the short term.  Hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities in the range of Rs 346-342. The possible near term targets for the stock are expected around Rs 358 and Rs 367. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 334.    Maruti Suzuki: Buy | LTP: Rs 8,737 | Stop-Loss: Rs 8,420 | Target: Rs 8,970 | Return: 3 percent  Post a corrective phase, the auto stocks have seen a positive momentum during last week and within this sector, Maruti has witnessed a pullback move along with rise in volumes. After the recent price-wise correction, the stock witnessed some consolidation and price volumes action indicates that the stock would resume its higher degree uptrend.  The RSI oscillator is in buy mode on the daily chart and is turning positive on the weekly charts as well.  Hence, traders can look to buy the stock on dips in the range of Rs 8,620-8,600 for potential targets around Rs 8,820 and Rs 8,970. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 8,420.    Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital  KEI Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,573 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 | Target: Rs 1,780 | Return: 13 percent  The KEI has recently shown a bounce to the upside while taking support from the Bullish trend line which the prices have respected since May 2021.  Around the level of Rs 1,385 the stock has witnessed change in its polarity by the prices which points towards the rising bullish sentiment behind the intact trend.  The stock's price has surpassed the 20-week EMA which acted as a variable support for the prices.  While the momentum indicator RSI on the Daily timeframe has shown a Range shift which reflects the rising momentum for the prices.  We expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 1,780 where the stop-loss must be of Rs 1,465 strictly on the closing basis.    Supreme Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,539 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,330 | Target: Rs 2,900 | Return: 14 percent  Supreme, is currently Trading near record Highs which tells that the stock already is in strong momentum.  The stock in the first week of November 2022 gave a breakout from the Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern which indicated beginning of the trend to the upside.  The bounce to the upside in the latest week is preceded by the prices taking support from the 16-week EMA, which acted as a strong variable support to the prices.  The RSI on the Daily timeframe has given a breakout, which reflect strong bullish momentum.  We expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 2,900 where the stop-loss must be of Rs 2,330 strictly on the closing basis.    Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 445.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 390 | Target: Rs 560 | Return: 26 percent  The correction in the Tata Motors post January 2022 took in a disciplined way as the stock did not get into lower low, lower high formation.  The stock in the latest week gave a breakout from the Descending Triangle pattern which points towards the beginning of the trend to the upside.  The breakout is confirmed as it was accompanied by higher volumes and a gap.  The momentum indicator RSI has shown a bullish breakout which reflects the strong momentum in the prices.  We expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 560 where the stop-loss must be Rs 390 on the closing basis.    Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi  Emami: Buy | LTP: Rs 439 | Stop-Loss: Rs 409 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 9 percent  In spite of the fact that the said counter has witnessed massive beating after making the high of Rs 524 on September 26, 2022 which resulted in a 22 percent cut in stock price. Since last month the said counter looks like it has stabilized around Rs 410-415 zone.  Following are some important points that are making Emami as a buy candidate:  Bullish Bat was seen on a daily scale with a potential reversal zone of Rs 415-425. Furthermore, bullish divergence was seen on the daily scale of RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence). In addition to bullish divergence, trendline violation was seen on RSI. (refer to the chart).  Selling volume has dried up from the recent fall from Rs 480 to 410 thus indicating a possible turnaround. In the previous trading session, the counter witnessed decent buying of 4.5 percent supported by good volume at lower levels.  Looks like the price structure has changed since Emami has vouched for by breaking its previous swing high of Rs 438 and successfully closing near Rs 440 mark.  One can buy in the range of Rs 436-442 in a small tranche and another around Rs 420-425 (if tested again). Target is expected at Rs 480 with a stop-loss of Rs 409 on a daily closing basis.    PVR: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,740 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,649 | Target: Rs 1,825 | Return: 5 percent  At the current juncture, PVR is trying to stabilize near the 0.618 retracements of its previous rally which was started from December 2021 till August 2022.  Following are some important pointers that are making PVR a buy candidate:  Bullish AB=CD was seen on a daily scale with a potential reversal zone of Rs 1,620-1,650. Furthermore, bullish divergence was seen on the daily scale of RSI and MACD histogram. In addition to bullish divergence, trendline violation is seen on RSI. (refer to the chart).  Also, Triple bottom formation was seen on 0.618 retracement which makes PVR more lucrative at current levels.  Looks like the price structure has changed since PVR has vouched for by breaking its previous resistance of Rs 1,700 and successfully closing near Rs 1,740 mark.  One can buy in the range of Rs 1,725-1,740 in a small tranche and another around Rs 1,680-1,700 (if tested again). Target is expected at Rs 1,825 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,649 on a daily closing basis.

HDFC,2023-01-27T13:39:51+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"MC interview| Shrinking regulatory arbitrage key driver for HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, says Deepak Parekh",eteran banker also said that the RBI rightly reined in inflation and that the days of jumbo interest rate hikes by central banks are behind us now. ,"The key driver for the merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) and HDFC Bank Ltd was the shrinking arbitrage between Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and banks in terms of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations, says HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh.  “Every new RBI policy entailed tightening of regulations for NBFCs,” Parekh told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on January 27. “So, the flexibility and the light-touch regulation that an NBFC enjoyed was fast disappearing, and rightly so, because a number of NBFCs had collapsed and some had even taken public deposits,” the veteran banker said.  On April 4, 2022, HDFC, India’s largest mortgage lender, announced that it would merge with HDFC bank in a $40 billion deal.  “The overall process of merger till final NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) approval could take 7-8 months after the shareholders’ approval. We believe that the merger could be completed a few months ahead of schedule by one to two quarters,&quot; HDFC Bank’s chief financial officer (CFO) Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said after the announcement.  With the merger in place, HDFC Bank can eye a bigger and larger role within the banking sector and the economy as a whole.  The merger, which is expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2023, will give HDFC access to over Rs 16.7 trillion rupees in funds including low-cost current and savings account deposits and time deposits of the bank.  Parekh said the merger made sense before the full implementation of the RBI’s regulations on NBFCs. Once completed, the combined entity will emerge as a stronger organisation with a large customer base, Parekh said.  RBI regulations for NBFCs  Parekh highlighted that the merger was important before the completion of the full implementation of the RBI regulations for NBFCs.  &quot;Banks have to maintain SLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio), CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) and have priority-sector loan limits, which NBFCs do not have. But, NBFCs are now required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),” he said.  SLR is the minimum percentage of deposits that a commercial bank has to maintain in the form of liquid cash, gold, government bonds or other approved securities.  CRR is the share of a bank’s total deposits that is mandated by the RBI to be maintained with the central bank as reserves in the form of liquid cash.  LCR refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets held by financial institutions to ensure their ability to meet short-term obligations.  Further Parekh said the classification of NBFCs by RBI hinted at risk factors stemming from the large NBFCs, one of them being HDFC.  The RBI has put in place a process for classifying all NBFCs into three broad categories—the upper, middle, and base layers. The mandate is that upper-layer NBFCs include the large ones that can pose a systemic risk to the financial system, Parekh said.  “These NBFCs now have to follow bank-like regulations. So, in a way, it made sense to do the merger ahead of the full implementation of these new regulations,&quot; Parekh added.  A bigger opportunity for combined entity  Parekh said apart from the regulations, the scope of a bigger business opportunity also inspired the company to work on the merger.  Explaining this point, Parekh said the bank is a big player in retail credit, but its retail portfolio is a short-duration one of around 18 months. HDFC bank does not give mortgage loans because this is HDFC’s core business. With the merger happening, this issue can be addressed, Parekh said.  “Now, as a combined entity, the bank will get long-term mortgage loans which will increase the duration of the retail portfolio. Further, with a larger customer base, the bank will be able to do a lot more cross-selling of products.&quot; the veteran banker said.  Inflation and rate hikes  To fight inflation, the RBI in the current rate hike cycle has increased the repo rate by 225 basis points. The repo rate is the rate at which RBI lends short-term funds to banks. One basis point is one- hundredth of a percentage point.  On how NBFCs guided the rate hike scenario, Parekh said: “We have to take care of so many, many moving parts and the RBI rightly articulated that it will rein in inflation, but would also keep in mind economic growth considerations.”  With inflation beginning to ease, Parekh said that central banks around the world have stopped their mega rate hikes.  “Even globally, with inflation beginning to ease a bit, I think the days of jumbo interest rate hikes by central banks are behind us now,” Parekh said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mc-interview-shrinking-regulatory-arbitrage-key-driver-for-hdfc-hdfc-bank-merger-says-deepak-parekh-9947411.html
HDFC,2023-01-27T08:44:38+05:30,Moneycontrol News,The one habit that Deepak Parekh can’t give up,"At 78, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh may have given up alcohol, but there is one habit he still holds on to. ","At 78, Deepak Parekh may have given up alcohol, but there is one habit he still holds on to. When Moneycontrol caught up with the chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation at his sixth-floor office in HDFC House, Nariman Point, Parekh admitted that he flouted most rules of good health through most of his life, but lost his taste for alcohol after battling Covid-19.  “I can admit that I mostly flouted all the rules in life when it comes to good health. I ate everything and used to enjoy a drink almost every night,” the veteran banker confessed. “Then in December 2021, I got Covid and post that, I've just lost the fondness for any alcohol. Even with friends, they'll drink while I’ll just have nimbu paani.”  But there is one habit he has no plans of giving up. “The one thing I won’t give up is doing a Sudoku every night before I sleep,” said Deepak Parekh, adding that the logic puzzle keeps his mind sharp.  “I’ll work on the most challenging, hardest Sudokus I can get my hands on. That excites me and helps keep the mind sharp,” he told Moneycontrol.  Parekh stepped down as CEO of HDFC more than a decade ago, but it’s clear he likes to remain in the thick of things. In fact, he still comes to office for a few hours every day, mostly for meetings and to stay connected with what’s happening in the business world. The 78-year-old is still on the boards of HDFC Life, HDFC AMC and Siemens India.  His focus these days is on ensuring that the mega-merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank goes through smoothly. This could take a bit of time, given that it entails approvals from Indian and US authorities (HDFC offers American Depository Receipts, too).  He had said last year that once this is done, he is looking forward to “keep my feet up and relax”. By his own admission, though, his Sudoku-a-day routine is unlikely to change even after the merger is done and dusted.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/deepak-parekh-interview-and-his-fondness-for-sudoku-9945171.html

HDFC,2023-01-23T09:11:02+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Top 10 trading ideas for next 3-4 weeks, backed by upbeat earnings, Budget optimism","Experts feel the 17,800-18,200 range is expected to break on either side after the announcement of the Budget, hence, if the Nifty breaks 18,200, then 18,500 is the level to watch out for ","The market ended a volatile week on a positive note on January 20, and sustained an upward swing for the the second straight week, with the Nifty taking support at the psychological 18,000 mark.  The index remained rangebound and formed a Doji candle for yet another week on the weekly scale with a higher-high-higher-low formation, as the closing was near its opening level, indicating indecisiveness among buyers and sellers about future market trend.  The index closed with 71 points gains at 18,028 for last week and has overall been consolidating within a tight range of 17,800-18,200 especially amid quarterly earnings and ahead of the Union Budget scheduled to be tabled in Parliament by the finance minister on February 1.  Experts feel the above range is expected to break on either side after the announcement of the Budget, hence, if the index breaks 18,200, then 18,500 is the level to watch out for as crossing it could bring a sharp upside, whereas the downside could be up to 17,500 if there is a decisive break of 17,800-17,900 levels.  &quot;As far as levels are concerned, the rock-solid support is visible at 17,900 – 17,750 and bulls have till now managed to defend it in a challenging environment. On the flipside, it has become a daunting task to surpass the hurdle of 18,150–18,300,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  The way our markets have undergone a long time-wise correction, he expects the breakout to happen soon from this contracted range.  He feels the week beginning today may see some action, although it will be a truncated one as the expiry is advanced by a day on account of the Republic Day on Thursday. &quot;Also, it’s important to understand that we are inching closer to the Union Budget and hence, the market would try to position itself ahead of this mega event,&quot; he said.  The stock-specific action is expected to continue in the current week too, given the ongoing corporate earnings season and Budget expectations, experts feel.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 20 closing prices:  Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities  Dabur India: Buy | LTP: Rs 566 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 590 | Return: 4 percent  Dabur has corrected from a high of Rs 611 touched in December 2022. The stock recently found support around Rs 538 level in January 2023. This is close to the previous intermediate lows, indicating a double bottom formation. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made a higher bottom in the last few sessions.  In the process, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend a buy between Rs 564-568 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 550 and target of Rs 590.    GAIL India: buy | LTP: Rs 99 | Stop-Loss: Rs 96 | Target: Rs 105 | Return: 6 percent  After correcting from a high of Rs 109 tested in April 2022, GAIL found support around Rs 83 level in September 2022. These are strong supports as they also roughly coincide with previous intermediate lows.  The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average). Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 97-101 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 96 and target of Rs 105.    Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 5,860 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,075 | Target: Rs 5,460 | Return: 7 percent  Bajaj Finance is in a short term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks. Recently, the stock broke down below its recent supports after reacting from close to its 50-day SMA. This indicates that the downtrend looks set to continue.  Technical indicators are giving negative signals as the stock is now trading below the 20 day and 50 day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI are in decline mode and not oversold, which implies potential for more downsides.  We therefore expect the stock to correct further in the coming sessions. Sell between Rs 5,855-5,865 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 6,075 and downside target of Rs 5,460.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Divis Laboratories: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,343 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,430 | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 7 percent  The stock was forming a rising leg bearish consolidation and the support was at Rs 3,350. On Friday, the stock closed below the level of Rs 3,350.  Based on the charts, the stock is heading towards the next supports, which are at Rs 3,250 and Rs 3,100. The stock is trending down and a breakdown of the formation should generate further bearish momentum in the near term. Sell at Rs 3,350-3,400, with a stop-loss of Rs 3,430.    HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,661 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 | Target: Rs 1,770 | Return: 7 percent  The stock has completed a corrective pattern at Rs 1,560 and has reversed sharply on the back of broad based buying in the private sector bank stocks, which will help the stock to exhibit a trending move in the near term.  However, we can be buyers only if it crosses Rs 1,670 or dips towards Rs 1,630. In either case, the stop-loss would be Rs 1,600. Above Rs 1,670 it will find resistance at Rs 1,720 and Rs 1,770.    SRF: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,105 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,000 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 19 percent  The stock is on the verge of completing a corrective pattern. It has displayed a trending movement between the levels of Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,865 during the period July 2022 to September 2022.  The corrective pattern is nearing completion between Rs 2,125 to Rs 2,100 levels. It will be an opportunity for traders and investors to invest in the stock from a medium term perspective. On the upside, on the reversal it would rally towards Rs 2,400 to Rs 2,500 levels. Keep a stop-loss at Rs 2,000 for holding positional long positions.    Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi  Minda Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 228 | Stop-Loss: Rs 215 | Target: Rs 260 | Return: 14 percent  The weekly chart of Minda Corporation depicts a perfect symmetrical triangle breakout above Rs 230 mark. The said pattern has a theoretical target of over Rs 300 level. The price action is supported by the positive placement of the weekly RSI which indicates strength in the momentum.  Thus, we advise traders to accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 226-230 with a stop-loss of Rs 215 (daily closing basis) for an upside target of Rs 260 on a daily close basis.    APL Apollo Tubes: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,197 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,140 | Target: Rs 1,300 | Return: 9 percent  The rally which was started in May 2022 till date resulted in 47 percent appreciation. Currently, it is trading above the 12-21-50 daily exponential moving averages (EMA), which is a sign of strength in the counter.  The previous trading session gave a clean breakout from the triangle pattern. On indicator front, daily 14 period RSI has taken support and then it has rebounded thus indicating further up move in APL Apollo Tubes.  One can buy around Rs 1,180-1,200 with an expected target of Rs 1,300 and the stop-loss would be Rs 1,140 on a daily close basis.    Expert: Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio  GNFC: Buy | LTP: Rs 563.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 590 | Target: Rs 660 | Return: 17 percent  The stock was seen to be retesting a breakout of a rounding bottom formation after five years on the weekly timeframe whereas on the daily timeframe the stock was seen to be taking support from a support zone and bouncing with high volumes which can be used as a confluence towards the bullish view.  The 200-day EMA is at around Rs 430 on the weekly timeframe and the stock is expected to be comfortably trading above it. The momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 46 showing strength by taking support at lower levels and the supertrend indicator is indicating continuation of the bullish trend.  Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move is possible in GNFC for target upto Rs 660. One can initiate buy on dip in the range of Rs 620-623 with a stop-loss below Rs 590 on daily closing basis.    Indoco Remedies: Buy | LTP: Rs 391.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 372 | Target: Rs 400 | Return: 2 percent  Indoco Remedies was seen to be breaking out of a downwards sloping triangle pattern on the weekly timeframe after one and a half years and on the daily timeframe the stock was seen to be making a double bottom formation which can be used as a confluence towards the bullish view.  The 200 DEMA is at Rs 321 on the weekly timeframe and the stock is comfortably sustaining above it which is a positive sign.  Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 59 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50 and the supertrend indicator is also indicating bullishness. Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move in Indoco is possible for target upto Rs 400. One can initiate a buy trade in between the range of Rs 385-387 with stop-loss of Rs 372 on daily closing basis.

With the weekly expiry happening today, volatility is likely to be high. However, the Nifty and Bank Nifty had a good follow-up yesterday. HDFC Bank, in particular, has shown signs of leadership and is currently within 5% of its 52-week high. From January 10th to today, HDFC Bank has seen a 4.4% increase in value while ICICI has seen a 1% increase.  This week, there are big FMCG Q3 numbers lined up which could have a bearing on sentiment. In terms of global cues, India is expected to be impacted by Fed talk, which has so far been quite hawkish. However, the market has called the bluff of the Fed and believes that the terminal rate is near. Nasdaq stocks are still outperforming in the US, and Indian IT stocks still have room for a rally. The China opening theme on metals is also expected to continue. The only global risk factor for India currently is a potential surge in commodity prices.  Looking specifically at the Nifty, there is heavy put writing at 18150, 18100 and 18000 strikes on the Nifty and no major call writing.

HDFC,2023-01-18T17:30:59+05:30,Jinit Parmar,"Banks go big on partnerships to expand services, lure customers","Lenders are tying up with global companies, fintechs and other organisations to provide additional and advanced services to their customers.","As the economy recovers from the pandemic, banks are going aggressive with partnership models to expand their services and get new customers.  Both public and private banks have been on a partnership spree in recent months to bring more customers on board. Lenders have also introduced offers by way of new debit and credit cards, digital banking services, and lending rates.  State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, has tied up with about 20 companies over the past five months to offer services ranging from digital banking and financial payment options to credit facilities. The lender recently partnered with Warehouse Development Regulatory Authority to provide low-interest rate loans to farmers. SBI also partnered with motorcycle company Jawa Yezdi to provide financial options to its customers.  Canara Bank, another public sector lender, has joined with National E-Governance Service Ltd. to expand its digital banking services. The lender will offer a digital workflow of bank guarantees that will eliminate physical insurance, stamping, verification, and paper-based record maintenance.  Among private sector lenders, Axis Bank has tied up with OPEN, a digital banking enterprise, to provide digital current account services for its various customer segments.  DBS Bank India recently partnered with Gofrugal Technologies, a platform offering ERP solutions to adopt Open Network for Digital Commerce for its enterprise customers.  Laura Spiekerman, president of Alloy, a fintech and banking facilitator, said in a report that such partnerships help banks adopt new technologies and infrastructure to provide their services.  “Partnerships with fintech companies help banks provide new features to eager customers without spending costly resources to build their own digital products, while still earning a share of the profits,” Spiekerman said.  International partnerships  Some private banks have partnered with international companies and airlines to expand their products and services.  HDFC Bank, the largest private sector lender, partnered with Microsoft for cloud services for its banking operations.  Yes Bank and Mastercard have got together to introduce a debit card for its ultra-high net worth individual customers.  IndusInd bank tied up with Qatar Airways and British Airways to introduce a multi-branded credit card.  Partnerships here to stay?  Banks have traditionally partnered with companies for reasons including reaching a wider customer network and availing advanced technological services.  As banks recover from the tumultuous times of the pandemic, experts said partnerships will be their focus for some time in the near future.  “Customers would prefer using different banking services. And not only that, but banks are looking for more tie-ups with companies. We feel that these partnerships will stay for some time,” said Vijay Singh Gour, a senior analyst at Care Ratings.  Any risks with partnerships?  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been strict on regulations concerning fintech firms and companies that are native to the digital ecosystem. Experts are of the opinion that barring partnerships with fintech and other digital lenders, on which RBI has kept a close watch, there is no risk involved in such partnerships.  Gour said there are some risks which the banks and the RBI are working on.  “The regulator has been working in a collaborative manner to mitigate the risks associated with fintechs and digital lenders,” Gour said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks-go-big-on-partnerships-to-expand-services-lure-customers-9889281.html

Both benchmarks had risen more than 0.5% earlier in the session.  ","Indian shares ended lower in a volatile session on Monday, weighed down by continued foreign investor selling and higher oil prices, which offset healthy earnings from HDFC Bank.  The Nifty 50 index closed 0.34% lower at 17,894.85, while the S&amp;amp;P BSE Sensex fell 0.28% to 60,092.97. Both benchmarks had risen more than 0.5% earlier in the session.  Ten of the 13 major sectoral indexes declined, with heavyweight financials falling 0.75% and metals losing 1.32%.  The reversal in the broader market almost mirrored the downturn in financials, which surrendered intraday gains, as did HDFC Bank despite a better-than-expected quarterly report. The stock of the country's largest private lender closed nearly 1% lower.  The broader weakness was due to foreign selling in Indian equities given their high valuations relative to markets such as China and Taiwan, where allocations were lowered earlier due to COVID curbs, three analysts said.  &quot;The volatility in the markets will continue in the near term due to extended selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPI),&quot; said Siddhartha Khemka, head of research (retail) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.  Data showed FPIs have sold 150.68 billion rupees ($1.85 billion) worth of equities so far this year.  Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been net sellers for the last sixteen sessions in a row the longest such streak in six months, according to exchange data offloading nearly 239 billion rupees worth of securities since Dec. 23.  Analysts also flagged a moderation in domestic investors' buying as another reason for volatility.  Meanwhile, oil prices held near 2023 highs on optimism that China's reopening will lift demand. High crude prices hurt big importers like India as it adds inflation pressure.

HDFC,2023-01-16T15:32:12+05:30,Jinit Parmar,How did HDFC Bank manage the highest ever deposit growth in Q3? Here’s what experts say,Analysts said HDFC Bank’s strong franchise network across customer segments and its competitive deposit rates boosted deposit growth,"HDFC Bank, India’s largest private sector lender, recorded the highest ever quarterly deposit growth for any bank in the third quarter ended December 31.  The bank’s deposits grew 19.9 percent to Rs 17.3 lakh crore from Rs 14.4 lakh crore in the year-ago period.  How did the bank achieve such high credit growth in a tough market?  Analysts said the bank’s strong hold across multiple segments alongside its wide franchise network helped it grow with record numbers.  “HDFC Bank remains one of the few banks to clock a strong deposit growth amid rising competition for deposits, given its robust franchise,” said Anand Dama, senior research analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services.  Segment growth  Current account and savings account (CASA) deposits grew by 12 percent, with savings account deposits at Rs 5.3 lakh crore and current account deposits at Rs 2.2 lakh crore.  The lender’s time deposits grew to Rs 9.7 lakh crore, jumping 26.9 percent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year.  Analysts said HDFC Bank’s wider branch network aided in the mop-up of deposits.  “With plans to boost up its network and services, the bank is opening a lot of new branches and making inroads in the rural areas,” said Karan Gupta, banking analyst at India Ratings &amp;amp; Research, a Fitch Group company.  Dama said the bank’s large corporate relationship network enables it to present its products and services to various customer segments.  “The bank’s wider network takes it to newer market and customer segments. Its range of outreach programmes has boosted the bank’s overall growth,” Dama said.  Can the lender sustain deposit growth momentum?  Analysts said the bank has consistently recorded almost 20 percent (YoY) and 4 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) deposit growth and will largely stay on the same path.  Attributing this to the bank’s plans for branch expansion and a race for competitive rate hikes, experts said it is unlikely that the deposit growth momentum will slow.  Gupta said, “With the bank looking to double its branch network over a three-year period, this will work as a major booster for deposit growth. Hence, we do not see any possible challenges for its deposit growth.”  To attract new customers, HDFC Bank hiked rates on fixed deposits for different tenures across customer segments in December. The bank now provides interest rates ranging from 4.5 percent to 7.75 percent.  “The bank has been one of the few players to clock a strong overall deposit growth given its robust franchise, and has now increased rates to accelerate deposit growth in the run-up to the merger,” said Dama.  HDFC Bank expects to amalgamate its home loan major parent HDFC into itself by September.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/how-did-hdfc-bank-manage-the-highest-ever-deposit-growth-in-q3-heres-what-experts-say-9875001.html

However, lower than expected provisions led to a beat on earnings at Rs123bn (vs expectations of Rs119bn) up 18.5% YoY. HDFC Bank remains one of the few banks to clock a strong deposit growth amid rising competition for deposits, given its robust franchisee. On the credit front, HDFC Bank remains opportunistic on the corporate side; thus, we are not too worried about the 3Q growth moderation. Bank continues to clock strong growth in the retail/SME segment which we believe should support its margins amid rising cost pressure. The merger process is on the fast track, with shareholder approval now in place; the bank is hopeful of it being completed earlier than guided. That said, clarity on the stake of HDFC Life and other subsidiaries as well as on the merger structure by the RBI remains elusive. Notwithstanding the merger-related regulatory overhang, we believe HDFCB offers the best play on India’s consumption story and is also a good defensive bet in current choppy waters.

HDFC,2023-01-13T19:44:37+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"HDFC Bank Q3 Preview: Net profit expected to grow 14%, margins seen to be steady",HDFC Bank Q3: Some analysts warn that a potential increase in slippages may be anticipated from the agriculture segment or the unsecured loan book.,"HDFC Bank is expected to report a 14 percent growth in net profit in the October-December quarter on the back of a 22 percent increase in net interest income, and steady margins.  The average of a poll of estimates of six brokerages shows that the private sector lender is expected to report a net profit of Rs 11,754 crore in the third quarter, and a net interest income (NII) of Rs 22,427 crore. The healthy NII growth is expected on the back of a robust 19.5 percent loan growth that the bank reported earlier this month in an early update of its business.  Analysts believe the lender’s loan growth is slightly disappointing given its historic performance. “HDFC Bank delivered weaker-than-expected q-q (quarter-on-quarter) growth in advances, despite strong growth of about 5 percent q-q in both retail and CRB (commercial and rural banking) segments. This was primarily due to a 1 percent q-q decline in the wholesale loan book (27 percent of total advances in 2QFY23),” pointed out analysts at BNP Paribas in a note.  Nevertheless, given the size of its loan book, the lender’s growth rate is still robust. Besides, HDFC Bank’s lending has been largely secure and to high-rated individuals and companies. Its risk-weighted assets are one of the lowest with respect to capital. Given this, the asset quality is expected to remain pristine for the bank. That said, some analysts warn that a potential increase in slippages may be anticipated from the agriculture segment or the unsecured loan book.  “HDFC Bank’s provisioning adequacy is heavily dependent on the fact that its stressed asset numbers are the very lowest in the sector. If this were to change for any reason, the provisioning burden on RoA (return on assets) will be high. However, such a change is very unlikely given the focus on prime assets,” the BNP Paribas report said.  The focus on high-rated loans may also weigh on its yield on advances. While that may translate into pressure on margins, the composition of the bank’s loan book may offset some of it, analysts said. HDFC Bank’s unsecured loan book and high-yielding commercial loans to small businesses has grown faster than other segments. Therefore, even though a large part of its book is fixed-rated, the lender has been able to transmit the increase in interest rates.  “The bank is chasing the best quality customers across product segments, which comes at a lower yield. This will be offset by growth led by high-yielding payment products, rural and commercial,” analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher wrote in a note. Those at Emkay Global Financial Services expect the net interest margin (NIM) to marginally improve to 4.3 percent in Q3FY23, from 4.1 percent a year ago.  For investors, guidance on loan growth and more importantly, on deposit growth, would be a key factor to watch for. HDFC Bank disappointed the Street with its growth in low-cost current and savings account deposits for the quarter. Further, management commentary on unsecured loans and credit costs would also be of interest. A big trigger for the bank’s stock, though, remains the conclusion of the mega-merger between the bank and parent HDFC Ltd.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hdfc-bank-q3-preview-net-profit-to-grow-14-percent-9862301.html

The new funding round was a mix of long-term debt capital from venture debt firms Alteria Capital and Stride Ventures and working capital finance from banks such as Standard Chartered Bank, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank, the company said in a statement on January 11. LEAD plans to use the funding for financing the company's organic and inorganic growth, the company said.  Last week, LEAD acquired learning company Pearson’s K-12 (kindergarten through standard 12) business in India and the company said it would fund the acquisition through new fundraising and internal accruals. However, the company did not disclose anything on the new fundraise then.  LEAD's debt fundraise comes at a time when many direct-to-consumer edtech companies in the country are struggling to raise equity funding amid a slowdown in venture capital and private equity investments. Edtech companies are thus looking to cut costs as they are expecting slower growth in the coming quarters.  “Traditionally, startups have had limited avenues for raising capital beyond equity. However, with our strong unit economics and a clear path to profitability, we have been able to attract non-dilutive, traditional capital from India’s biggest banks and largest venture debt funds, which is value accretive to our shareholders,” said Sumeet Mehta, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of LEAD.  “LEAD is poised for 2X growth and this latest round of funding will help us fast-track our mission of providing high quality, integrated School Edtech solutions to over 60,000 schools across India by 2026,” Mehta added.  Founded by Mehta and Smita Deorah in 2012, LEAD runs a platform that tracks teacher and student progress, managing school operations on the cloud and providing digital resources to make learning more engaging. The company turned a unicorn in January 2022.  For FY22, LEAD reported a net loss of Rs 397.1 crore, which widened from Rs 126.1 crore a year earlier, as the company's employee benefit costs surged more than 2.5 times during the year. However, with schools reopening in FY22, LEAD managed to double its revenue to Rs 141.6 crore in FY22 from a year earlier.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/school-edtech-platform-lead-raises-rs-160-crore-in-debt-capital-a-day-after-layoffs-9849301.html

This was mainly due to de-growth in the corporate book (down 1% QoQ/up 20% YoY), while Retail continued its strong growth momentum (up 21.5% YoY/5% QoQ), as did Commercial Banking (at 30% YoY/5% QoQ). We believe, this should support margins amid rising funding costs. Credit growth, gross of IBPCs and bill rediscounted, also stood low, at 24% YoY/3% QoQ in Q3 vs 26% YoY/7% QoQ in Q2. The Mortgage-Book purchase from HDFC Ltd continued to be high, at Rs88.9bn in Q3 (vs Rs91.5bn in Q2). Deposit growth of the bank remains healthy at 20% YoY/4% QoQ, while other banks continue to struggle. Overall CASA growth was slower at 12% YoY/ flat QoQ (Retail CASA grew 14%YoY/1% QoQ), which led to a slight decline in CASA ratio, at 44% vs 45% in Q2. We believe slippages could remain elevated in Q3 due to seasonal stress in the Agri portfolio (including KCC) which, coupled with slower credit growth, could keep NPA ratios largely flat. With the bank sitting on healthy, specific + contingent provisions, we expect LLP to moderate, which should thereby support net profitability. Outlook We believe that slower credit growth coupled with lower fees and elevated opex in the run-up to the merger could keep core-profitability growth in check. Post the recent uptick, the stock is currently trading at 2.7x FY24E ABV (ex-subs valuation). We retain our long-term BUY rating on the stock, given healthy return ratios, strong capital comfort and reasonable valuations. We will revise our estimates/TP post the results, once we attain better clarity on the growth/margin outlook and the merger process from Management.

HDFC,2022-12-29T16:21:38+05:30,Manish M. Suvarna,"CPI inflation may ease to around 5.3% in FY24, says HDFC Bank's Swati Arora","Upside risks to inflation could emanate from rising Covid cases in China, and if cases in India rise as well,  that could again disrupt supply chains. ","Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is expected to ease to about 5.3 percent in the next financial year, aided by a correction in commodity prices, Swati Arora, Economist at HDFC Bank, said in an interview to Moneycontrol.  &quot;Heading into FY24, CPI inflation is expected to ease to about 5.3 percent supported by a correction in commodity prices, while core inflation is expected to stay elevated at around 5.8 percent,&quot; she said.  She added that the upside risks to inflation could emanate from rising Covid cases in China,  and if cases in India rise as well,  that could again disrupt supply chains.  In November, the headline retail inflation declined to an 11-month low of 5.88 percent from 6.77 percent the previous month, while core inflation continued to remain high at over 6 percent.  Following a similar drop in October, November was the first time in 2022 that inflation had fallen below the 6 percent upper limit of RBI’s 4 +/- 2 percent tolerance band. However, CPI inflation has exceeded the medium-term target of 4 percent for 38 months in a row.  To fight higher inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has aggressively hiked the repo rate since May. Thus far, the central bank has increased the repo rate, or short-term lending rate, by 225 basis points (bps).  Going ahead, Arora said elevated and sticky core inflation and downside risks to domestic growth due to weak external demand will remain a challenge for the RBI.  &quot;The RBI has appropriately responded by tightening policy to control inflationary pressures, which in India’s case are predominantly supply driven,&quot; Arora said.  Also read: Inflation conundrum: How RBI’s commentary changed in 2022  Budget expectations  Arora expects the government to allocate higher capital expenditure amid headwinds like a slowdown in global growth and exports, and tightening financial conditions. Capex has a multiplier effect on economic output, making it essential for growth.  Further, the budget is likely to see enhanced allocation towards the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, PM KISAN Yojana, etc., in order to support the rural economy.  &quot;The government wants to return to a path of fiscal consolidation. In the FY24 budget, the government is likely to reduce the fiscal deficit by 0.4 percent to 6 percent of GDP,&quot; she said.  She expects borrowings , which are important for the bond market, to remain higher compared to the previous fiscal due to higher redemption. &quot;This is likely to maintain upward pressure on bond yields,&quot; Arora said.  The yield on the 10-year benchmark government bonds have gone up from 6.45 percent at the beginning of the year to 7.31 percent as on December 28, 2022.

She added that weak risk sentiment as Covid cases rise again, along with a slowdown in global growth, could keep any meaningful appreciation in check.  The INR:USD rate is likely to see some gains in H1 2023 within a band of 80.5-82.50, before moving to a higher range of 82-83.50 in H2, Arora said.  The rupee has remained volatile through the year and the RBI has been intervening in the forex market in the last few months to defend it from depreciating sharply.

HDFC,2022-12-19T06:58:04+05:30,Bloomberg,HDFC Bank targets issuing one million credit cards a month,The bank wants to double the current pace of half a million new credit card issuances every month,"India’s largest private bank HDFC Bank Ltd. is seeking to issue a million credit cards a month, a remarkable bounce-back for the lender after the country’s regulator banned it from taking on new card clients two years ago.  The bank wants to double the current pace of half a million new credit card issuances every month, according to Parag Rao, country head for payments business, consumer finance, digital banking and marketing. The firm will announce partnerships across a range of industries from online retail to food delivery in the coming weeks to increase spending on cards, Rao said.  The recovery for HDFC Bank has been swift since the eight-month long card ban was lifted in August last year, with the lender seeking to move past the punishment for repeated online glitches that hurt its customers. Reserve Bank of India data showed that the bank captured 29% of India’s overall spending on credit cards in October, the highest among its competitors.  “We focus not only on the issuance of cards which is a distribution game, but on deep engagement, ensuring customers find more value in their cards, and keep spending,” Rao said in an interview.  The partnerships in the next few weeks also include two airlines and a large hotel chain, according to Rao. HDFC Bank is in the final stages of developing a new digital credit card to pull in younger customers, he added.  Banks in the world’s second most populated country are poised to benefit from the growth in online shopping where customers use their credit cards for purchases. Between 200 million and 300 million Indians are expected to spend $50 billion on online retail this year, according to a Bain &amp;amp; Co Inc. report.  Part of the push at HDFC Bank will be tied to its merger with Housing Development Finance Corp., which will give it access to the mortgage lender’s customers, Rao said. The two firms agreed to combine this year in one of the biggest global deals to ride a boom in home loans and consumer spending in India.  Beyond partnerships, the bank also wants to attract more customers who use credit cards from India’s local retail payment system known as RuPay, according to Rao. He sees recent rules that allow the linkage of RuPay credit cards to the widely used government-backed payment interface expanding the market for these cards.  “The credit lines for such customers will be small but these will be customers of the future, who can upgrade to other cards as they evolve,” Rao said.  And while peers are offering rewards on a slew of products to gain customers, HDFC Bank is avoiding this strategy.  “We never have had the best discounts in the market nor do we want to be known as the card with the most discounts,” Rao said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/hdfc-targets-issuing-one-million-credit-cards-a-month-9726431.html

Retail constitutes about 83% of total deposits, retail deposits have been the anchor of their deposit growth.  Outlook HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the under-penetration of banking services in the country. The proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to the future. We believe that the runway is huge. HDFC Bank’s earnings trajectory remains on track with continued growth in retail. The ongoing expansion of branch network and cards business, coupled with the merger, is expected to aid long-term growth. Nevertheless, the bank’s long-term outlook remains positive. We thereby retain our BUY rating on the stock, with a revised target price of Rs. 1,908.

HDFC,2022-12-13T17:22:20+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra,"Staples, cement good medium-term bets; financials, industrials for long term: Amish Shah, BofA","BofA Securities is underweight on the information technology, automobile and healthcare sectors","Bank of America Securities is overweight on financials, industrials, staples and cement, head of India equity research Amish Shah said at a media roundtable. However, investors should rotate out of staples and cement in six months, he added.  “In the cement sector, there is good demand visibility for the next few months till Q2FY24, when the seasonally weak quarter begins,” said Shah. He said Budget 2023 will create many opportunities, with subsidies expected for infrastructure schemes including Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and rural employment guarantee projects. These subsidies eventually lead to creation of an asset, so they are as good as capital expenditure, he explained.  Staples are expected to do well as rural sentiment is slowly turning the corner.  “All factors for a bounce-back in demand are lining up, like moderating of inflation and increase in non-farm income,” he said.  Foreign institutional investors and domestic mutual funds are materially underweight on staples versus their historical averages. Thus, the sector could see greater inflows in 2023, BofA Securities said.  Also Read: Nifty to hit 20,000 in 2023, driven by FII flows, says BofA Securities  Another good defensive bet, according to Shah, is the utilities sector.  “Reforms that are currently in the draft stage which propose privatisation of power distribution operations could be a game-changer,” he said.  Valuations are undemanding, with one-year forward price-to-book ratio at 1.4x.  Underweight sectors  BofA Securities is underweight on the information technology, automobile and healthcare sectors.  “21 percent of the Nifty is export-linked and these sectors will see the sharpest earnings cut,” said Shah.  The firm expects the earnings cut for the automobile sector to be 79 percent, the highest. Healthcare will likely get a 19 percent cut and IT 14 percent.  “Despite heavy outflows, FII positioning still remains slightly overweight on the IT sector and this has potential to reduce further. Valuations at 24x versus an average of 19x don’t give us any comfort,” he said.  Also Read: IT stocks head for worst year since 2008 as growth winter sets in  Long-term bets  The bottom line is India will outperform developed market equities but will underperform emerging markets next year. With India’s structural story intact, financials and industrials will be good long-term bets, said Shah.  “There could be some contraction in net interest margins as the competition for deposits takes off amid banks. But there is good visibility on earnings and strong asset quality,” he explained.  The recent run-up in public sector banks is not keeping BofA at bay.  “The stocks are still trading below their book value and there is more steam left,” he said.  BofA Securities’ pecking order in the financials space is private and public sector banks over insurance companies. Non-banking financiers come last in the list. It has ‘buy’ ratings on HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.  Industrials is another multi-year bet, according to BofA Securities. Apart from the capex upcycle, underweight positioning of FIIs and current valuations at 22x (versus 26x at peak cycle) give analysts some comfort. Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, Bharat Electronics, and Adani Ports are the top ‘buy’ calls in the sector.

HDFC,2022-12-13T11:45:19+05:30,Bloomberg,HDFC-HDFC Bank merger to shake up India’s debt market,"The consolidation of Housing Development Finance Corp. and unit HDFC Bank Ltd. will create a more than $200 billion financial services behemoth, and the parent will be able to tap the bank’s deposits to grow, rather than pile on more debt.","India’s biggest merger ever will likely take away from the rupee bond market one of its top issuers, an absence that may weigh on debt sales and arrangement fees for banks.  The consolidation of Housing Development Finance Corp. and unit HDFC Bank Ltd. will create a more than $200 billion financial services behemoth, and the parent will be able to tap the bank’s deposits to grow, rather than pile on more debt. That’s not all bad for India’s bond world as the hole created by the shadow lender may let new borrowers sell notes, helping India deepen its debt market.    The shadow lender is India’s biggest bond seller in 2022, with its issuance accounting for 7.7% of the country’s total issuance volume this year, higher than an average of about 6% in the last 10 years, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The merged entity will be a bank and is still likely to offer notes when needed to boost its capital buffers and fund infrastructure projects.  “HDFC’s exit will initially hurt overall sales volume next year,” said Jayen Shah, founder of Mavuca Capital Advisors Pvt., a fintech investment banking firm. “I expect a lot of first-time issuers, state and private companies tapping the bond market next year as yields stabilize, which may then gradually fill the void.”  The merger, expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2023, will give HDFC access to 16.7 trillion rupees ($202 billion) of funds comprising so-called low-cost current and savings account deposits and time deposits of the bank. That will let it continue expanding its assets, which stood at 6.9 trillion rupees at the end of September.  The exit of a debt issuer of that size risks hurting the fee income of bankers who have arranged HDFC’s various offerings. In the last few years, Axis Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. have overseen most of those sales, Bloomberg-compiled data show.    For HDFC’s competitors, though, the firm’s exit may be a positive in fundraising terms. “The departure of HDFC from the bond market would benefit its peers as it will give them access to a larger pool of credit,” Mavuca’s Shah said. “That in turn will cut funding costs of other top-rated housing finance companies.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-hdfc-bank-merger-to-shake-up-indias-debt-market-9696301.html
HDFC,2022-12-12T07:51:44+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Amid profit booking, check these top 10 trading ideas by experts for next 3-4 weeks","The banking index has been showing outperformance and is continuing its uptrend after some consolidation. Among private sector banks, Axis Bank is showing strength and has given a breakout above its previous swing high resistance.","After moving closer to 18,900 level in the beginning of December, traders seem to have preferred profit taking and hence the Nifty50 is caught in a bear trap. The index lost more than 1 percent in the week ended December 9, after run-up in previous two consecutive weeks. Slightly hawkish tone by the Reserve Bank of India and caution ahead of FOMC meet weighed on market sentiment despite correction in oil prices amid global recession fears.  The index closed a tad below 18,500, the support which was being held on to for several sessions in the recent past. Overall if the same gets decisively broken then Nifty can take support at crucial 18,400-18,300 area, whereas on the other side, 18,600-18,700 zone is going to be near term resistance followed by new high, experts said.  &quot;The Nifty is now placed slightly above the key support of '20-day EMA' (exponential moving average - 18,465) which coincides with previous swing high of 18,450. Hence, we continue to remain upbeat as long as 18,400 – 18,300 is not violated on a closing basis,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  Until then, he feels any intermediate decline should only be construed as  profit booking before resuming the upward trend.  On the flipside, 18,650 – 18,700 are the levels to watch out for. The moment Nifty surpasses this, one should gear up for yet another milestone of 19,000 in the near future, the expert said.  Traders are advised not to get carried away by such small declines. Rather it’s better to focus more on thematic moves, especially from the broader end of the spectrum, Sameet advised.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the December 9 closing prices:  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Thermax: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,057 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,875 | Target: Rs 2,350 | Return: 14 percent  The stock is in the last leg of a corrective pattern. It could drop to Rs 1,950 or Rs 1,960 levels, where it has seen key support since March 2022.  Technically, it will mark the second low in the last two months. Our advice is to buy the stock 50 percent at current levels and the balance at Rs 1,950 with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,875 and we can keep a target of Rs 2,350 or Rs 2,450 in the medium term, which is the pullback level for the stock.    HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,631 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,590 | Target: Rs 1,722 | Return: 5.6 percent  It is forming a triangle consolidation formation between Rs 1,640 and Rs 1,590 range. It has shown a trending move from Rs 1,365 levels.  The overall formation is suggesting that the current formation is a continuation formation and on the dismissal of Rs 1,642, it will jump to the level, which lies between Rs 1,675 and Rs 1,722.  Buying around Rs 1,630 and Rs 1,620 is appropriate with a stop-loss at Rs 1,590.    Divis Laboratories: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,274 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350 | Target: Rs 2,978 | Return: 9 percent  The stock is forming a series of lower top and lower bottom. On weekly basis, the stock closed below Rs 3,330 level, which was last week's low.  It is negative for the stock and it may witness further weakness till the next level, which is at Rs 2,978. The stock closed on a weekly basis at Rs 3,274 and based on technical analysis, the downside is favourable for short sellers with a stop-loss at Rs 3,350.    Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities  Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC: Buy | LTP: Rs 449.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 490 | Return: 9 percent  Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC has corrected from a high of Rs 503 touched in September 2022. The stock recently found support around the Rs 400 levels in October 2022. This is close to the previous intermediate lows, indicating a double bottom formation. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made higher bottoms in the last few weeks.  Last week, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend a buy between Rs 440-460 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 430 and target at Rs 490.    Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 350.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 332 | Target: Rs 382 | Return: 9 percent  After correcting from a high of Rs 470 in January 2022, Suprajit Engineering found support around Rs 272 levels in March 2022. These are strong supports as they are just above the 200-day EMA.  The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of huge volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.  With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. One can buy between Rs 348-355 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 332 and target at Rs 382.    Bata India: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,679 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,739 | Target: Rs 1,580 | Return: 6 percent  Bata is in a short term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks. Recently, the stock broke down below its recent supports and also reacted from the 20-day SMA last week. This indicates that the downtrend looks set to continue.  Technical indicators are giving negative signals as the stock is now trading below the 20-day and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI are in decline mode and not oversold, which implies potential for more downsides.  We therefore expect the stock to correct further in the coming sessions. One can sell between Rs 1,670-1,684 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,739 and downside target at Rs 1,580.    Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities  Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,227 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,030 | Target: Rs 3,580 | Return: 11 percent  The stock consolidated after retracing 50 percent of prior up-move (Rs 2,560-Rs 3,546) and witnessed a range breakout. The stock also closed above its 20-week EMA and rose to 9-week closing high.  Its weekly Stochastic is positively poised; its RSI gave buy signal, while its MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is on the verge of a bullish cross-over.  The stock has potential to move towards Rs 3,490 initially and Rs 3,680 subsequently.  In case of any decline, the stock will continue to find support at around its 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move.    Colgate Palmolive: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,657 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,570 | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 10 percent  Since couple of weeks, the stock oscillated above its cluster of moving averages (20-week EMA, 50-week EMA and 100-week SMA) and poised for a breakout.  In the last two weeks, the stock witnessed a steady rise with above average volume, which signals that major market participants were in favour of the bulls.  The key technical indicators are positively poised on medium-term as well as short-term timeframe charts. We believe the stock will rebound utilising prior consolidation and move towards its life-time-high.  On the lower side, the stock will find support around its cluster of moving averages.    Dr Reddy's Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,407 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,210 | Target: Rs 4,900 | Return: 11 percent  Post a trendline breakout, the stock again tested that extended line and formed a bullish reversal pattern. The stock also found support around its 100-day SMA and reversed.  This could take the stock towards Rs 4,600 initially and Rs 4,900 subsequently.  Major technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on the near-term timeframe chart.  In case of any volatility, the stock will find support around its long-term moving averages (100-day and 200-day SMAs).    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 934 | Stop-Loss: Rs 908 | Target: Rs 985 | Return: 5.5 percent  The banking index has been showing an outperformance and it is continuing its uptrend after some consolidation phase. Within the private sector banks, Axis Bank is showing strength and has given a breakout above its previous swing high resistance.  The prices above its 20 EMA support, the volumes along the price upmove are good and the RSI oscillator is indicating a positive momentum.  Hence, we expect the uptrend to continue in Axis Bank, so short term traders can look to buy this stock around Rs 934 for potential targets of Rs 969 and Rs 985. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 908.    Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 351 | Stop-Loss: Rs 337 | Target: Rs 376 | Return: 7 percent  The stock has been consolidating within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern since last few months and prices have given a breakout from the pattern on Friday. This entire consolidation is above its weekly 200 EMA which indicates that long term uptrend is still intact.  The volumes have improved in last couple of sessions and if the stock gives a follow up move, then it could lead to a decent trended upmove going ahead.  Hence, traders can look to buy the stock around current market price of Rs 351 for potential targets around Rs 365 and Rs 376. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 337.
