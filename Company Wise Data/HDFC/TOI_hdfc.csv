However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

Nifty also rose by 85.55 points to reach 22,418.20.TCS, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, and Bharti Airtel were among the major gainers.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the current trend in the market is a correction in the broader market, particularly in small-cap stocks. The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision.

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

HDFC Bank notes that the RBI encourages banks to permit base rate borrowers to transition to MCLR when there's a change in policy rates. However, it's advisable to seek professional advice before making a decision. Financial advisors can offer updated insights and assist in the transfer process.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-loan-interest-rates-latest-adjustments-and-details/articleshow/107488742.cms

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

Nifty also rose by 85.55 points to reach 22,418.20.TCS, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, and Bharti Airtel were among the major gainers.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the current trend in the market is a correction in the broader market, particularly in small-cap stocks. The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision.

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

HDFC Bank notes that the RBI encourages banks to permit base rate borrowers to transition to MCLR when there's a change in policy rates. However, it's advisable to seek professional advice before making a decision. Financial advisors can offer updated insights and assist in the transfer process.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-loan-interest-rates-latest-adjustments-and-details/articleshow/107488742.cms

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

Nifty also rose by 85.55 points to reach 22,418.20.TCS, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, and Bharti Airtel were among the major gainers.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the current trend in the market is a correction in the broader market, particularly in small-cap stocks. The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision.

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

HDFC Bank notes that the RBI encourages banks to permit base rate borrowers to transition to MCLR when there's a change in policy rates. However, it's advisable to seek professional advice before making a decision. Financial advisors can offer updated insights and assist in the transfer process.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-loan-interest-rates-latest-adjustments-and-details/articleshow/107488742.cms

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

Nifty also rose by 85.55 points to reach 22,418.20.TCS, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, and Bharti Airtel were among the major gainers.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the current trend in the market is a correction in the broader market, particularly in small-cap stocks. The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision.

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

HDFC Bank notes that the RBI encourages banks to permit base rate borrowers to transition to MCLR when there's a change in policy rates. However, it's advisable to seek professional advice before making a decision. Financial advisors can offer updated insights and assist in the transfer process.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-loan-interest-rates-latest-adjustments-and-details/articleshow/107488742.cms

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

Nifty also rose by 85.55 points to reach 22,418.20.TCS, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, and Bharti Airtel were among the major gainers.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the current trend in the market is a correction in the broader market, particularly in small-cap stocks. The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision.

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

HDFC Bank notes that the RBI encourages banks to permit base rate borrowers to transition to MCLR when there's a change in policy rates. However, it's advisable to seek professional advice before making a decision. Financial advisors can offer updated insights and assist in the transfer process.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-loan-interest-rates-latest-adjustments-and-details/articleshow/107488742.cms

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

Nifty also rose by 85.55 points to reach 22,418.20.TCS, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, and Bharti Airtel were among the major gainers.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the current trend in the market is a correction in the broader market, particularly in small-cap stocks. The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision.

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

HDFC Bank notes that the RBI encourages banks to permit base rate borrowers to transition to MCLR when there's a change in policy rates. However, it's advisable to seek professional advice before making a decision. Financial advisors can offer updated insights and assist in the transfer process.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-loan-interest-rates-latest-adjustments-and-details/articleshow/107488742.cms

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

Nifty also rose by 85.55 points to reach 22,418.20.TCS, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, and Bharti Airtel were among the major gainers.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the current trend in the market is a correction in the broader market, particularly in small-cap stocks. The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision.

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%.

HDFC Bank notes that the RBI encourages banks to permit base rate borrowers to transition to MCLR when there's a change in policy rates. However, it's advisable to seek professional advice before making a decision. Financial advisors can offer updated insights and assist in the transfer process.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-loan-interest-rates-latest-adjustments-and-details/articleshow/107488742.cms

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision. The bank also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1500 crore for employees as a reward for extra effort during the merger.Jagadishan said that despite having 11% of the country's banking deposits, HDFC Bank is still ""very small"" compared to State Bank of India, which has a share close to 20%. He emphasized that the bank would continue to grow its market share in deposits, which would provide momentum for loan growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-transition-is-like-coastal-road-construction-phase-jagdishan/articleshow/109487533.cms

Nifty also rose by 85.55 points to reach 22,418.20.TCS, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, and Bharti Airtel were among the major gainers.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the current trend in the market is a correction in the broader market, particularly in small-cap stocks. The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms

However, he added that the bank would not use pricing to grab market share and would go slow when faced with irrational pricing, such as in the fourth quarter. He also mentioned that the average deposits per branch had increased from Rs 260 crore to Rs 270 crore after adjusting for the HDFC merger.“Don’t dismiss this franchise, we are going through a period of transition. It is like the coastal road..when it was being built we had all sorts of problems with it.. but now when it is up and running people are so delighted,” said Jagadishan to analysts in investors call after the bank’s results.Jagadishan explained that the key to sustainable momentum is the bank's enhanced customer engagement and elevated `Service First' culture. He emphasized that HDFC Bank had reached excellence in this deposit mobilization franchise over 30 years due to their customer-first approach. The only way to be even better, according to Jagadishan, is to elevate the customer service-first culture, with a lot of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in place internally.However, Jagadishan did not speak about the new digital initiatives, including the new mobile banking app that the bank had earlier planned to launch in the previous quarter. HDFC Bank has been facing criticism from investors due to the bank's market value remaining below the Rs 12 lakh crore mark, compared to the Rs 12.6 lakh crore in July 2023 when the merged entity shares were traded for the first time. Customers have also been complaining on social media about the bank's mobile application, which is the primary banking channel for most customers.On Saturday, HDFC Bank announced a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore - an increase of 37% of last year's pre-merger gains but 0.8% lower than the preceding quarter. The bank made extraordinary gains from sales of education loan company HDFC Credila but transferred the gains to a floating provision.

Nifty also rose by 85.55 points to reach 22,418.20.TCS, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, and Bharti Airtel were among the major gainers.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the current trend in the market is a correction in the broader market, particularly in small-cap stocks. The small-cap index has fallen 7.8% from its peak, and this correction is expected to continue due to excessive valuations. Regulatory actions are also likely in the small-cap segment, as the regulator Sebi has expressed concerns about frothy valuations.He further said that there may be redemptions from small-cap funds, adding to the downside. While quality large-cap stocks are expected to bounce back after the correction, small caps are unlikely to recover in the near term. PSE stocks that have experienced rapid growth are also likely to face selling pressure.Stocks that witnessed a decline included ITC, Nestle, JSW Steel, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Tata Steel.In Asian markets, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading higher, while Tokyo and Shanghai were in negative territory.

Recent market trends show state-owned lenders outperforming private banks, with shares of banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Canara Bank seeing significant gains.State-owned lenders are experiencing improvements in asset quality and profitability, resulting in their shares outperforming those of private banks, with many reaching multi-year highs. Over the last month, State Bank of India surged by nearly 15%, Punjab National Bank leaped by 26.82%, and Canara Bank saw a gain of 23.5%. Union Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed increases of over 13% and 15%, respectively.In contrast, HDFC Bank declined by 14.2%, Kotak Mahindra fell by 4.9%, Axis Bank decreased by 6%, and ICICI Bank saw a modest rise of 0.74% during this period, according to an ET report. 107624606These share prices signify an enhanced investor perception regarding the profitability of public sector banks when compared to their private counterparts.Niket Shah, a fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC, noted that PSU banks are experiencing a re-rating due to exceptionally low credit costs and better asset quality, resulting in higher profit after tax (PAT) growth compared to private banks. He highlighted that the substantial increase in profits for PSU banks is primarily driven by reduced credit costs and robust asset under management (AUM) growth ranging between 12-14%.This shift in perception towards PSU banks contrasts sharply with the sentiment prevailing a few months ago when investors were skeptical about their prospects. The significant earnings improvement in the December quarter, especially in comparison to private banks, whose results disappointed investors and led to share price declines, has bolstered confidence in the outlook for PSU banks.The narrowing gap in share valuations between PSU and private banks indicates a changing investor preference within this sector. Previously, private banks commanded higher Price to Book (PB) ratios, ranging from 2.5-2.8 times, whereas PSU banks traded at lower PB ratios of 0.4-0.6 times. Currently, private banks are valued at 2-2.4 times PB, while PSU banks have seen an increase to 1-1.3 times on average.Analysts anticipate further convergence in valuations, suggesting that PSU bank shares may outperform their private counterparts in the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-vs-hdfc-bank-why-public-sector-banks-are-beating-private-banks-on-the-stock-market/articleshow/107623951.cms
