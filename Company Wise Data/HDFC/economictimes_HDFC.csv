HDFC,2024-05-07T12:26:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Axis Bank brings expats to India in push to woo global firms,"Axis Bank Ltd. aims to boost its global business by hiring Asian expatriates, targeting mid-sized companies from countries like South Korea, Japan, US, Germany, Italy, and France. Facing challenges with South Korean and Japanese firms due to language barriers, the bank has recruited expatriates to facilitate connections and expand its corporate banking division.","Axis Bank Ltd is on a lookout to hire Asian expatriates to help the lender win business from multinational companies. The bank, that recently overtook Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. to become the third largest private lender in India, is targeting mid-sized companies in this area, the fastest growing business in its corporate banking division. It sees this as an “under-served” market by global banks, according to Rajiv Anand, Axis’ deputy managing director.Axis is focused on companies from countries like South Korea, Japan, US, Germany, Italy and France that have good ties with India. Getting the inside track into South Korean and Japanese firms has proven tougher however, due to language and cultural barriers, according to Anand. The bank is seeking to bring on board expatriates who can help make connections with companies and their executives, Anand said. So far, it has hired a Korean expatriate, based in the southern city of Bangalore, and a Japanese, who was relocated to Mumbai.Financial firms in India have been on a hiring spree, though the country doesn’t have the depth of domestic talent that other more established markets do. Headhunters see the likes of investment banks seeking to bring professionals who carved out careers abroad back to India and Bloomberg Intelligence said finance professionals in the country may be in line for a 10% pay rise this year, outstripping rival locations in Asia.Axis is ranked second behind HDFC Bank Ltd. for arranging local currency loans in India so far this year, and fifth place for foreign currency loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

HDFC,2024-04-30T10:52:00+05:30,Bloomberg,View: The Indian banks' tech you love is a banana peel for RBI battling potential scams,"The Indian financial system, recovering from a history of bad loans, faces new challenges as banks grapple with technology pitfalls. Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. was recently penalised for security deficiencies, highlighting broader risks of fraud and system vulnerabilities in the digital age. Regulatory scrutiny intensifies amid concerns about financial stability and cybersecurity in the evolving landscape of digitisation.","After being saddled for years with the biggest bundle of bad loans anywhere in the world, the Indian financial system had only recently found its footing. But with profitability at a decade high and capitalization well in excess of the regulatory minimum, the country’s banks have begun slipping again. This time, they’re falling on the banana peel of technology.The latest casualty is Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Last week, the regulator ordered what was until recently India’s fourth-largest lender by market value to stop onboarding new customers through its online and mobile banking channels and refrain from issuing fresh credit cards. The Reserve Bank of India said it had found “serious deficiencies” in how the bank manages user access, vendor risk and data security. This is a pretty stiff punishment: More than 98% of the transaction volume in Kotak’s savings accounts were from digital or non-branch methods in the December quarter; 99% of new credit cards and 95% of personal loans it sold were also online.While Kotak says it has already taken some measures and will “swiftly resolve balance issues at the earliest,” the sheer brazenness of last year’s scam at UCO Bank is likely to make the RBI very cautious in lifting the ban. UCO is a small, government-owned lender based in the eastern city of Kolkata. Last November, it discovered that some customers had received nearly $100 million via interbank electronic fund transfers, but accounts at the sending institutions hadn’t been debited.Also Read: Kotak Mahindra Bank is the latest student in RBI's classroomThis month, federal investigators said that this was no error, but a scam. A couple of outside engineers had allegedly fiddled with UCO’s servers, creating money out of thin air, and crediting it into different accounts. Several of the account holders have made “wrongful gains by withdrawing the proceeds,” according to the police complaint filed by UCO Bank.This is the crux of the issue. The RBI’s press release highlighted “frequent and significant outages in the last two years” in Kotak’s services that inconvenienced customers. While these are indeed annoying, the bigger risk is a UCO Bank-type scenario where the same money can be spent twice because it shows up in two accounts. If something like that starts happening at scale because of malfeasance or negligence, it could pose serious risks to financial stability. All benefits from digitization pale in front of such a threat. And digitization has undoubtedly brought benefits, particularly to non-state-owned lenders. Take Kotak, which now has 8.5% of the deposits of State Bank of India, compared with less than 6% seven years ago. This increase in market share hasn’t required a commensurate expansion in physical presence. SBI, the largest deposit-taking institution, has added nearly 5,000 branches since 2016 — 10 times as many as Kotak. Even as they have gained from it, banks have not paid as much attention to technology as they should have. In December 2020, the RBI barred HDFC Bank Ltd., the largest private-sector lender, from issuing new credit cards and launching fresh digital initiatives. The card ban was lifted after eight months; the digital blockade lasted more than a year. This isn’t just an Indian problem. Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd., which under Chief Executive Officer Piyush Gupta has aspired to rank alongside some of the world’s most admired technology brands, has also stumbled on small things like an overheated data center. Recurrent glitches have become such a serious issue with customers, regulators and investors that even after delivering a return on equity of 18%, Gupta took a 30% cut in his variable pay.In India, fintech has sped up money transactions, but it has also introduced complexity. An otherwise staid banking system, running its software on servers stored on its premises, is suddenly having to cope with a tsunami of small transactions coming via intermediaries that do most of their computing in the cloud. A widely used smartphone-based protocol, known as Unified Payments Interface, logged more than 100 billion transactions last year. There are some 50 million merchants accepting online money via QR codes, but the regulator isn’t sure if all of them are legit. Fast and furious may have opened the floodgates to fraud.A rattled RBI is in a mood to punish. Earlier this year, it instructed Paytm, the homegrown payments pioneer, to freeze its banking business because of persistent non-compliances. Separately, it also asked Visa Inc. to stop the use of its business cards for commercial payments where a fintech is in the middle.Drastic supervisory steps may be necessary at times, but they won’t be enough. The regulator needs to update its own understanding of technology — the last edition of the RBI’s 164-page financial stability report devoted a mere four paragraphs to digital safety even though the central bank’s survey showed cybersecurity as a “high-risk” category.The threat levels are indeed rising. A 2022 study by DeepStrat, a New Delhi-based consulting firm, had raised concerns about what it called a “fraud stack” — a large number of bank accounts “controlled by crime cartels without their owners being aware of their identities being misused,” says Anand Venkatanarayanan, one of the report’s authors. In one instance, the customer’s address in a bank’s records was the same as that of the bank branch. When such mule accounts hide in plain sight, attacks become highly probable. Customers deserve better, as do investors in India’s banks.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Technically, the sentiment along with price action and placement of oscillators, all remain in the favour of bulls for the time being.

Out of the 220-point gain in the Nifty, about 150 came from these stocks and Axis Bank, he said. The VIX jumped 12% to 12.24 on Monday, indicating caution among traders. The VIX may have moved up in response to the Fed meeting, which is a major event, along with Bank Nifty expiry on Tuesday, driving up volatility in the market,  said Sneha Poddar, associate vice president, equity research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.While the Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady at the end of the two-day meeting on Wednesday, the central bank's comments on when it plans to start cutting rates will be of greater interest to the market.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/bulls-score-big-on-the-rebound-indices-jump-1/articleshow/109708452.cms

Global markets also lent support to sentiments back home.,"Indian headline indices returned to their winning ways after a one-day hiatus, led by strong buying action in banks. While the S&P BSE Sensex rallied 990 points to hit the day's high of 74,721.15, the broader Nifty50 climbed by over 230 points to hit 22,655 mark. Finally, the Sensex on Monday settled at 74,671.28, up 941.12 points or 1.28%, while Nifty 50 closed at 22,643.40, gaining 223.45 or 1%. Volatility remained high as India VIX closed at 12.24%, gaining 12% over Friday’s closing.Here are a few factors that led to the surge in Nifty and Sensex:1) Banks and financials shineBanking stocks which corner the highest weight in the 50-stock Nifty were trading with strong momentum. ICICI Bank, SBI, HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank were four of the top five index contributors today.The Nifty Bank index hit a fresh lifetime high today, rising 1,200 points. Barring IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank, the remaining 10 counters in Nifty Bank were trading in the green.

Crude oil prices were down thanks to some letdown in geo-political tensions that created panic after Iran's missile attacks on Israel earlier this month followed by the retaliation by the latter. The US WTI crude oil contracts were trading at $83.030 per BBL, down by $0.820 or 0.980% while the Brent Oil futures were down by over $1 per BBL to $88.490.4) Geopolitics tensions easeIsrael-Hamas peace talks in Cairo eased fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East, boosting demand for risky assets like equities.5) Benign greenbackUS dollar cooled off on Monday ahead of the Fed's two-day monetary policy meeting beginning Tuesday.

However, these losses did not overshadow the weekly gains, which were fueled by a post-results rally in key index constituents and reduced concerns regarding the Middle East.The NSE Nifty 50 was down 0.67% to 22,420, on the day, while the S&P BSE Sensex shed 0.82% to 73,730. Both the indexes snapped a five-day winning streak. However, for the week, the Nifty 50 and Sensex gained about 1.25% and 1%, respectively.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: The Nifty witnessed selling pressure throughout the day and closed weak for the day down ~120 points. On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty has faced selling pressure from the resistance zone of 22560 – 22625. Until this zone is not taken out decisively, we can expect the consolidation to continue. On the downside, crucial support is now placed at 22240 – 22200 where support parameters in the form of the 40-day moving average and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from 21777 – 22626 is placed,  said Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Nifty remained under selling pressure throughout the session as the index failed to sustain above the crucial level of 22500. On the daily chart, a dark cloud cover pattern is observed, indicating a potential bearish reversal. Immediate support is situated at 22300, below which the Nifty could extend its losses towards 22000. On the other hand, the level of 22500 might act as a technical resistance for the Nifty. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday's action:US Market Close HigherUS stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq registered their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2023. Benchmark S&P 500 snapped three weeks of losses, while the Nasdaq ended four straight weeks of declines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.40%, the S&P 500 gained 1.02% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.03%.European Shares Notch 1.8% Weekly GainThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 1.2% higher, notching up a weekly gain of 1.8%, its biggest since late January.The basket of STOXX 600 banks touched a nine-month high, aided by a 6.1% jump in NatWest after the British bank's first-quarter results.Tech View: Dark cloud cover candlestickNifty ended 150 points lower on Friday to form a dark cloud cover candlestick on the daily chart while the weekly one saw a high wave type candle suggesting consolidation in the near term.The short-term trend of Nifty seems to have reversed down after a reasonable rise from the lows. Immediate support is placed at 22300 and the weakness below this support could trigger more declines ahead. Immediate resistance is at 22625 levels, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.Stocks showing bullish bias:Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of HUDCO, Westlife Foodworld, Tech Mahindra, DCM Shriram, Lemon Tree Hotels, and Bank of Maharashtra among others.The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.

HDFC,2024-04-28T10:19:00+05:30,ET CONTRIBUTORS,Why Nifty Bank has underperformed Nifty50 in the past one year,​Rallies in the markets may not present a clear picture of certain key developments. This is the very nature of the markets. A little bit of digging helps reveal stories which may not be apparent in the broad sentiment which engulfs the markets.,"Rallies in the markets may not present a clear picture of certain key developments. This is the very nature of the markets. A little bit of digging helps reveal stories which may not be apparent in the broad sentiment which engulfs the markets. Take for instance, the banking index. In the past one year ended April 22, 2024, the Nifty Bank index has given only 12.41% returns compared to 25.89% returns by the Nifty 50 index. Beneath this underperformance lies a story. Let us explore it in detail:Investors preferred public sector banks (BPSUs) to private sector banks. BPSUs largely finance institutional and corporate borrowers and private sector banks are known for catering retail credit needs. Despite strong credit offtake, stocks of private sector banks did not do well. There is a reason. Private sector banks were richly valued compared to BPSUs. In a high interest rate regime, value conscious investors preferred to stick to BPSU. The PSU rally also improved the sentiment around PSU bank stocks. However, these stocks have a relatively low weight (around 15%) in the Nifty Bank index. Hence the positive impact on Nifty Bank Index was not as much.The largest stock in the Nifty Bank Index – HDFC Bank--with 29% weight remained under pressure through the year due to a variety of reasons. Investors have concerns about the challenges related to compliance and funding post the merger of HDFC Bank with its parent: Housing Development Finance Limited (HDFC). In the past one year, HDFC Bank's shares have lost 10.3%.Another important reason for weak performance of banks' stocks is the regulatory actions by the Reserve Bank of India. RBI slapped fines to many lenders due to slippages in the areas of know-your-client, risk categorisation, and provisioning among others. Though, fines looked small in the context of the quantum of profits of banks. RBI also made a few banks stop onboarding new clients and selling new credit cards. These actions impacted stock prices of banks. Investors also factored in lower earnings from other banks offering similar products, anticipating similar regulatory actions. These facts turned investors cautious.In contrast to this, stocks from auto, power and energy sectors did well and lifted the returns offered by the Nifty 50 index. Among constituents of the Nifty 50 Index, Bajaj Auto, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and Tata Motors gained more than 100% in the past one year. All in all, this was not a year for banking stocks. Even Q4 numbers announced by HDFC Bank were below expectations. However, things are expected to change for the better going ahead.Going forward, as net interest margins (NIM) of banks stabilise due to increasing deposits and credit offtake, profitability of banks should improve. If inflation comes down and interest rates are cut towards the end of the current year, then it should improve banks' earnings. This can trigger upward movement in the Nifty Bank index.In the near term, geo-political tensions in the Middle East and the Lok Sabha elections are the two events which could trigger volatility in the broad markets. The Nifty Bank Index should get a strong support at 46,950 and then at 45,500. A close above previous high of 49,057, should take the Nifty Bank index to a new high of 51,300 if possible.On the Nifty 50 index, 21800 should act as a strong support. If the Nifty 50 index does not break it and manages to stay above the psychologically important level of 22,000, then the Nifty 50 index should see an upside of 22500-22800. A new high around 23,150 is possible. However, a break below 21,800 will take Nifty 50 to 21,250 and 20,800 levels.(The author is the founder & CEO of SAS Online – a deep discount stock broking platform.

HDFC,2024-04-26T14:41:00+05:30,PTI,"RBI action on Kotak Mahindra Bank may restrain credit growth, profitability: S&P","S&P Global Ratings warned that RBI's recent regulatory action on Kotak Mahindra Bank could limit the bank's credit growth and profitability. The RBI prohibited Kotak Mahindra Bank from issuing new credit cards and onboarding customers online, impacting a key growth segment. S&P noted the bank may need to rely more on physical branch expansion, increasing operating costs. However, the impact on the bank's credit rating is expected to be minimal, as credit cards constitute a small portion of its total loans. S&P anticipates that Kotak Mahindra Bank may need around a year to address the RBI's concerns related to system stability and disaster recovery. ","S&P Global Ratings on Friday said RBI's regulatory action on Kotak Mahindra Bank could restrain the lender's credit growth and profitability. The RBI on Wednesday barred Kotak Mahindra Bank from issuing fresh credit cards and onboarding new customers online.  Credit cards are a higher-yielding target growth segment for Kotak Mahindra Bank. This portfolio grew at 52 per cent year-on-year as of December 31, 2023, compared with total loan growth of 19 per cent, the US-based rating agency said.   Action by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) this week could push the bank to rely more on physical branch network expansion to supplement growth thus entailing higher operating costs,  S&P said, adding that it could be a setback for credit growth and profitability.  This action will not, however, materially affect our ratings on Kotak Mahindra Bank (BBB-/Stable/A-3). This is because credit cards make up a small 4 per cent of total loans as of the end of December 2023. The bank will still be able to cross-sell its other products to existing customers.   We anticipate Kotak Mahindra Bank could potentially take a year to fully address the RBI's key concerns for the bank which encompasses systems stability, patch management, and disaster recovery,  S&P said.  RBI's actions on Kotak Mahindra Bank follow similar actions in recent years on other financial institutions in India.  S&P said in a similar case in 2020, when HDFC Bank was temporarily barred from sourcing new credit card customers, it took the bank more than a year to meet the RBI's requirements and have restrictions lifted.  In the past 18 months, Kotak Mahindra Bank has made significant progress on technological enhancements, including the hiring of senior level executives in the chief technology officer and chief experience officer positions, S&P said.  Nevertheless, it will take time for the bank to implement changes and conduct a comprehensive external audit to address the RBI's concerns.  RBI's actions on Kotak Mahindra Bank follow several outages of the bank's core banking systems as well as online and digital banking channels, and deficiencies identified through the RBI's IT examinations in 2022 and 2023.  This shows the regulator's commitment to strengthening the financial sector and its diminishing tolerance for operational deficiencies.  Systems stability and robust disaster recovery planning have become increasingly important with the rapid scale up in digital transactions in India.   Regulators across many jurisdictions are adopting a similar playbook. The Monetary Authority of Singapore recently imposed a six-month ban on DBS Bank Ltd from making new acquisitions and closing branches or ATMs following several service disruptions in 2023,  S&P noted.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/banking/finance/banking/rbi-action-on-kotak-mahindra-bank-may-restrain-credit-growth-profitability-sp/articleshow/109621499.cms
