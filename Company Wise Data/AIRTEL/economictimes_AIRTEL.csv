AIRTEL,2024-05-06T23:49:00+05:30,Himanshi Lohchab,"MNP number shows competition intense as Jio, Airtel fight for Vi users","Telecom companies compete fiercely for market share. Vodafone Idea struggles without 5G. Airtel and Jio focus on service quality and rural expansion. Broadband users increase, with Jio leading the growth.","Telecom companies’ battle for subscriber market share gains is coming to a boil with March month's mobile number portability (MNP) churn continuing to remain high for almost two quarters now.While Vodafone Idea (Vi) is losing new users due to absence of 5G network, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio are aggressively competing on service quality and foray into rural regions. But, all three telcos have reported net additions in broadband wireless subscribers in March as the industry added net 6.8 million users, which is higher than past six months’ average 6.2 million subscribers, ICICI Securities said in an analyst report on Monday.“Sector MNP remained elevated, suggesting stiff competition and a focus on market share gains,” said Jefferies. “We expect MNP requests to stay high, partly on VIL users porting out to 5G on Bharti/Jio. Rising MNP could also stem from rising competition between Jio and Bharti for 5G subs and Bharti's rural foray.”According to data published by the telecom regulator, industry wide porting in the month of March 2024 was at 11.4 million and churn rate at 1% which has been consistently high for over a year now.Overall, healthy broadband subscriber additions could relate to traction on affordable Jio Bharat handsets and Airtel’s focus on higher-quality subscribers, according to brokerage firm Jefferies.Reliance Jio added more active subscribers than its rivals, but number two telco Bharti Airtel added higher paying 4G and 5G users in March 2024.Airtel added 3.5 million wireless broadband subscribers compared to Jio’s net addition of 2.1 million, while Vi added 1.1 million subscribers after two consecutive months of net loss, Morgan Stanley wrote.Jefferies termed Vi’s gain as “positive” but cautioned that the trend needs “to be monitored before arriving at any definitive conclusion of stabilization on this front. VIL's recent fund raise could have a bearing on its subscriber additions in the future,” it said.In March 2024, the sector's active subscriber base rose by 5.6 million to a peak of 1,058 million – the highest monthly additions in a year, Jefferies added. Active subscribers are those who have roamed in a particular area that an operator serves.March month’s active user addition was led by Jio (up 3.6 million) after trailing behind Bharti for three months. While this suggests a marginal improvement in Jio’s subscriber base quality, Airtel will continue to lead revenue conversion in absence of tariff hikes, sector analysts said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/telecom/telecom-news/mnp-number-shows-competition-intense-as-jio-airtel-fight-for-vi-users/articleshow/109894455.cms

The auction will cover airwaves in various bands, with the government expected to make some selective buying. The auction is expected to be a muted affair, with top telcos having sufficient 5G airwaves for their current needs.","All the three private telecom operators –Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea - will slug it out to get a piece of 5G spectrum worth Rs 96,317.65 crore to be offered in the next auction, which will start on June 6.The telecom department has received three applications for the auction - from India’s three private telcos - by the deadline for applying, officials told ET. No new company has applied this time. In the last auction held in 2022, an Adani group unit was the surprise bidder.The auction was earlier scheduled to start on May 20, but the date was extended in the wake of general elections.Airwaves in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz and 26 GHz bands will be put on sale.Industry experts and analysts expect the upcoming spectrum sale to be a muted affair as India’s top telcos have adequate 5G airwaves for their current needs. The auction is likely to only see some selective buying by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi), who have to renew their airwaves in a few circles.Sunil Mittal-led Airtel needs to renew its airwaves in J&K, Odisha, Bihar, UP (East), West Bengal and Assam. Vodafone Idea needs to renew its spectrum in West Bengal and UP West circles.As per Jefferies’ recent estimates, Airtel and Vi merely need to renew airwaves worth around Rs 4,200 crore and Rs 1,950 crore, respectively, while market leader Reliance Jio does not have any spectrum renewals coming up this year.In the last spectrum sale in July 2022, which was India’s maiden 5G auction, the government had mopped up over Rs 1.5 lakh crore. It had offered over 72 GHz of airwaves for 20 years across 10 5G bands, worth Rs 4.3 lakh crore at reserve prices.The spectrum will be assigned for 20 years and successful bidders will be allowed to make payments in 20 equal annual instalments.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has provided an option to surrender the spectrum acquired through the upcoming auction after a minimum period of 10 years.Spectrum bidders are not required to submit any financial bank guarantees (FBG) and performance bank guarantees (PBG).Airwaves bought in the auction won’t attract any spectrum usage charges (SUC) in keeping with the telecom reforms initiated in September 2021.The DoT will publish ownership details of the applicants on May 10.The last date for withdrawal of applications is May 17, and the final list of bidders is scheduled to be declared on May 20.The successful bidders have to deposit the amount to DoT within 10 calendar days from the issuance of demand notice by DoT.

The CCI approved the transaction recently, the person added.In its application to the CCI, Airtel said the transaction is an intra-group shareholding consolidation and does not constitute any change in market dynamics, the entry or exit of any player, or a change in the management of the business operations of BTL.The application identified India's upstream market for digital set-top box manufacturing and sale and the downstream market for aggregating and distributing TV channels through DTH services as relevant markets for the CCI’s review.This is the second major deal to be completed in the DTH sector, following Tata Sons’ acquisition of Singaporean investment firm Temasek's 10% holding in Tata Play for $100 million at a $1-billion valuation. Tata Sons now owns a 70% stake in Tata Play, with Walt Disney holding the rest.Bharti Airtel acquired Lion Meadow’s 20% stake in Bharti Telemedia in February 2021 for Rs 3,126 crore through issuance of 36.47 million equity shares of Airtel at Rs 600 per share and up to Rs 1,037.8 crore in cash.The stake acquisition, which will increase Bharti Airtel’s shareholding in Bharti Telemedia to 100% from 80%, valued the DTH firm at Rs 15,630 crore.Bharti Telemedia, which provides DTH services under the Airtel Digital TV brand, had 16.1 million subscribers at the end of December 2023. It is the country’s second-largest DTH operator after Tata Play, which has 21 million subscribers.The Warburg Pincus affiliate exited Bharti Telemedia in less than four years after acquiring a 20% stake in it for Rs 2,258 crore in December 2017, valuing the DTH arm at Rs 11,290 crore.In FY23, Bharti Telemedia slipped into the red with a net loss of Rs 349 crore against a profit of Rs 465 crore in the previous year. The company’s revenue dropped 7% to Rs 2,949 crore.While reaffirming the firm’s credit ratings, Crisil noted that Bharti Telemedia has made provision of around Rs 2,980 crore towards potential DTH licence fee liabilities, which are currently sub-judice.The rating agency also noted that Bharti Telemedia’s liquidity remains strong, with cash and liquid investment at over Rs 250 crore as of March 31, 2023.

FY24 saw telecom equipment production crossing ₹45,000 crore, with exports around ₹10,500 crore and over 19,500 direct jobs created. India has shifted from being a telecom gear importer to a manufacturer, driven by Make-in-India and the PLI scheme. ","Telecom equipment manufacturing and exports is emerging as a new success story after smartphone exports.Telecom equipment production for FY24 crossed the Rs 45,000 crore milestone with exports of around Rs 10,500 crore, backed by the Centre’s production linked incentive (PLI) scheme. The scheme has also led to creation of over 19,500 direct jobs, according to government data shared exclusively with ET.“Telecom equipment manufacturing was a dream for our country and the Make-in-India and PLI programme have really succeeded,” telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told ET. He said India has been a telecom gear importer for decades which changed after the Make-in-India and PLI scheme, driving production of equipment worth more than Rs 45,000 crore in the country.Telecom equipment comprises complex products such as radios, routers, network equipment, among others. Further, the government has allowed companies to claim benefits for making 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) equipment. Leading telcos Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are betting big on FWA to monetise 5G and all products are made locally. As per government data, of the total Rs 45,988.54 crore worth of sales till February, global firms contributed Rs 36,537.68 crore with domestic firms accounting for Rs 6,768.74 crore and MSMEs at Rs 2682.12 crore. In terms of employment, domestic companies created 14,525 jobs, followed by MSMEs (2984 jobs) and global firms at 2041 jobs.India-made telecom equipment is currently being exported to North America and Europe with top telecom companies globally as customers. “Lots of our Indian manufacturers are getting design inputs into the products. Products are designed in India, made in India and then exported, and the quality of products is good,” the minister said.Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had notified the PLI scheme for telecom and networking products in February 2021 with an outlay of Rs 12,195 crore over five years. A total of 31 companies got approval on October 14, 2021, for the scheme, which offers incentives of 4% to 7% for different categories and years. For MSMEs, a 1% higher incentive is proposed in year 1, year 2 and year 3.The scheme was amended in April 2022 to facilitate design-led manufacturing with an additional incentive rate of 1%, setting aside a sum of Rs 4,000 crore from the total allocation. The scheme was also extended by a year as most selected firms failed to achieve production targets due to Covid-related supply chain disruptions.A total of 42 firms, including 28 MSMEs were selected under the revised scheme. These companies had committed to invest a total Rs 4,115 crore and were expected to generate additional sales of Rs 2.45 lakh crore and create additional employment of more than 44,000 over the scheme period.Some of the prominent firms in telecom PLI scheme include Samsung, Dixon Technologies, HFCL, Jabil, Flextronics, Sanmina, Rising Star, Nokia, Tejas, etc. Nokia and Ericsson have utilised the majority of India-made radios for rolling out 5G networks of Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. In FY23, over 20 companies met the targets, including Nokia, Jabil, Sanmina, HFCL, VVDN, Coral and Tejas Networks. However, in FY24, the number of firms meeting the targets would rise, said officials.To boost equipment manufacturing, the Centre had tightened rules around custom duty payments by gear importers to plug leakages.

Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.","A recovery is in the offing in India’s telecommunications sector, with potential tariffs hikes and a shift to high-speed networks set to bolster revenue, according to a top-performing fund manager.“We are likely headed for a large hike in tariffs,” said Niket Shah, chief investment officer at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. He estimates that one such increase can boost the industry’s Ebitda by more than 500 billion rupees, and add up to 7 trillion rupees ($84 billion) in combined market value.The likely tariff increase will help inject new life into a sector that has grappled with cut-throat competition and aggressive policy actions in recent years, said Shah. America’s top wireless carrier AT&T Inc.’s average revenue per user is $55, while the measure is as low as $2 in India, he said.The optimism was palpable last week as Vodafone Idea Ltd., the smallest of the three players in India, raised $2.2 billion in a share sale that was oversubscribed more than six times. Nuvama Institutional Equities said this fundraise may mark a turning point for the sector, providing the company the much-needed capital to compete with larger rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and Bharti Airtel Ltd.109677779“It’s clear that the government doesn’t want to see telecom become a duopoly, so we can expect policy support,” said Shah, who oversees $3.2 billion across five equity funds. Motilal Oswal’s flagship fund has returned about 58% in the past year, beating over 90% of peers.Shah held Bharti Airtel and tower operator Indus Towers Ltd. in his portfolios at the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Mukesh Ambani’s Jio disrupted the market in 2016 with cheap 4G data services, sparking a price war that reshaped the sector into a near-duopoly dominated by Jio and Bharti. Average revenue per user plunged, burdening telecom operators with massive debts.In 2022, Vodafone Idea converted the dues it couldn’t pay to the government into a 32% equity stake.The industry is now showing signs of stabilizing, driven with investments into newer technology and efforts by companies to clean up balance sheets. Antique Stock Broking Ltd. estimates a 15% to 17% tariff increase for the sector — the first hike since 2021 — after India’s on-going elections conclude.109677801The shift in sentiment means that some shares are expensive relative to history. Bharti Airtel trades at nearly 37 times its forward earnings, versus the two-year average of 31. Also, Vodafone Idea continues to lose subscribers to competitors. Analysts caution that the fundraise may not be sufficient to stem this decline.

Birla called it a  fresh lease of life  for the telco, which has been facing challenges from competitors like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. The funds will be used to improve the network, densify it, and selectively introduce 5G services, marking the beginning of 'Vi 2.0'. The company's overall debt now stands at Rs 4,000 crore, which Birla considers low.","Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of Aditya Birla Group, hailed the recent Rs 18,000 crore fundraise by Vodafone Idea as a significant development for the company, describing it as a  fresh lease of life.  This fundraise, achieved through a follow-on public offer, is expected to provide the much-needed financial boost to Vodafone Idea, which has been facing stiff competition from rivals in the telecom sector.Calling it as the beginning of 'Vi 2.0', Birla said the money raised will be invested in the business, which will trigger a cycle of growth. Vi will stage a smart comeback, this moment marks the beginning of Vi 2.0,  Birla said at the listing ceremony.When asked if most of the problems for the company get sorted with the capital raise, Birla answered in the affirmative. And this is like a sort of fresh lease of life for the company,  he said.Strategic Investments for GrowthBirla highlighted that the funds raised will be utilized to enhance Vodafone Idea's network infrastructure, with a focus on expanding its coverage and introducing 5G services in select areas. This strategic approach, referred to as 'Vi 2.0' by Birla, aims to position Vodafone Idea for a strong comeback in the telecom market, where it competes with major players like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. A nation of 1.4 billion people deserves three private telecom players,  he said, calling Vi as a  national asset  which serves 215 million people and possesses over 8,000 MHz of spectrum.Government Support and Market DynamicsBirla acknowledged the support of the government's telecom reforms in enabling Vodafone Idea to reach this milestone. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a competitive market with three private telecom players, referring to Vodafone Idea as a  national asset  that serves millions of people across the country.Financial Stability and Investor ConfidenceDespite the challenges faced by Vodafone Idea, Birla expressed confidence in the company's financial health, noting its low overall debt of Rs 4,000 crore. He also highlighted the substantial investments made by Vodafone and the Aditya Birla Group in the company, totaling over Rs 1.70 lakh crore, demonstrating a long-term commitment to its growth.Bankers' Confidence and Investor ResponseSBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara, speaking at the same event, praised Birla for his leadership and credited him for instilling trust and confidence among bankers and investors. Khara reiterated the need for three private telecom players in the country and commended Birla for his personal investment and the global investor response to the fundraise.Positive Market Response and Future OutlookThe successful fundraise, oversubscribed by nearly 7 times, reflects strong investor confidence in Vodafone Idea's future prospects. The retail portion of the follow-on public offer also received full subscriptions, indicating widespread investor interest in the company's turnaround strategy. Vodafone Idea's stock closed 5.27% higher at Rs 13.78 on the BSE, reflecting the positive market sentiment towards the company's strategic initiatives.Kumar Mangalam Birla's optimistic outlook, backed by strong investor support and strategic investments, suggests a promising future for Vodafone Idea as it embarks on its next phase of growth.

The retail investor trust in the Aditya Birla Group reflects confidence in Vi's future growth in the telecom sector.","State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said the success of Vodafone Idea’s follow-on public offer (FPO) will put the telco in a different trajectory as it underlines the “leap of trust” of the larger investor community that stems from Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla assuming chairmanship of the cash-strapped telco.“We as bankers have lived through and considered the concerns relating to the entity (read: Vi), which it has gone through but I am very happy that the outcome has been nothing but a reflection of the trust and confidence shown by Mr Birla himself,” Khara said. The SBI chairman was speaking at an event to mark Vi’s FPO listing on the NSE Thursday. He added that the “the leap of trust” seen from the larger investor community is essentially attributed to Birla assuming the chairmanship of Vi and showing the way on what should be done. “It’s also an unflinching commitment to the telecom sector which he has demonstrated via putting his personal money as well as sourcing the capital from across the globe. I think it’s not a small recognition.” Khara said that the nation needs at least three (private) telecom providers, saying this is the wish of the government too. “But I think all that could not have happened unless Mr Birla would have shown his support.”Earlier, Vi’s board had approved a preferential share issue to raise Rs 2,075 crore from an Aditya Birla Group (ABG) entity, which had set the stage for a wider funding programme critical for the company’s revival.Vi’s FPO is expected to be followed by a Rs 25,000 crore debt issue, helping achieve the telco’s targeted Rs 45,000 crore fundraising drive aimed at regaining financial health and bolstering competition with bigger and profitable rivals Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel.According to the SBI chairman, digital is the future, and with that, the opportunity that exists in the country. “If at all our own investors would not have been there, the sector would certainly go away to foreign investors. Not that we are against it, we welcome them but at the same time we as proud Indians, we also should be the beneficiary of growth that will be seen in the sector.”He added that retail participation in the fully subscribed portion (of the Vi FPO) is a reflection of trust that investors have in the Aditya Birla Group.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/telecom/telecom-news/fpo-to-put-voda-idea-on-growth-path-sbi-chairman/articleshow/109585345.cms

Compared to the FPO price of Rs 11 per share, the stock was trading 20% higher. While Vodafone Idea's FPO listing around Rs 12 is a modest increase from the issue price, it reflects initial selling pressure for short-term gains. However, a drop below Rs 11 seems unlikely given the company's turnaround potential. Positive signs and potential post-election tariff hikes could trigger fresh buying after this initial volatility,  said Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart. Aggressive investors with a long-term view might consider holding onto the stock, aiming for a potential rise towards Rs 18 in the future,  Nyati said.The Rs 18,000 crore FPO, which is the largest India has seen so far, received decent from investors overall, but most of the heavy listing was done by institutional and non-institutional investors.The part reserved for QIB and NII investors was booked just over 19 times and 4 times, respectively. Meanwhile, the retail portion was subscribed to just 1.01x, which meant that the retail investors got what they bid for.Ahead of the offer opening, Vi raised over Rs 5,000 crore from nearly 60 anchor investors, making it the third-largest anchor book after One 97 Communications and Life Insurance Corporation.VI is the third largest telco in India based on subscriber base. The company is raising funds for capex purposes of increasing its network infrastructure by expanding the capacity of the existing 4G sites and setting up new 4G and 5G infrastructure as well.The company said it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets within 6-9 months of the issue. The 5G rollout will cover 40% of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months.VI has not been able to roll out 5G services because of a lack of funds.
