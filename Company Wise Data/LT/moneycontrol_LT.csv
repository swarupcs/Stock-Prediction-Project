Momentum in new orders in international hydrocarbon, mobility and power transmission and distribution businesses will also drive growth. The company is due to announce its Q4 result on May 8.  The engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) giant is expected to see its fiscal fourth-quarter net profit rise to Rs 4,380 crore, up 9.8 percent from the year-ago period, according to a Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerage estimates.  The company's revenue is expected to jump 18.6 percent YoY to Rs 65,402 crore. L&amp;amp;T's EBITDA is likely to jump 31 percent on-year to Rs 7,553.9 crore, according to Moneycontrol's poll.  Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect core E&amp;amp;C business EBITDA margin to come in at 9.9 percent, up 70 bps on-year, as legacy orders are near completion. The brokerage noted that for EPC players international ordering activity has been robust, with L&amp;amp;T bagging civil related orders from Saudi Arabia and UAE.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  Strong order outlook, margin benefit  The outlook for these geographies is sanguine as crude oil continues to trade above $70 per barrel. “Governments in these countries have laid out a roadmap to pivot away from their dependence on oil, which augurs well for the company in terms of opportunity pipeline,” said Motilal Oswal.    According to Elara Securities, L&amp;amp;T may outperform peers on account of more orders available for execution. Since raw material pricing was benign for Q4, with steel prices down 14 percent on-year and cement prices 2 percent YoY, analysts believe it may prop up the EPC firm's margins despite high competitive intensity.  According to Prabhudas Lilladher, L&amp;amp;T is well-placed to benefit in the long run with strong tender prospects, significant traction in hydrocarbons, renewable energy orders from international markets like Saudi Arabia, and an expected uptick in domestic private capex.  With robust order inflow growth, execution completion of legacy projects, refinancing of Hyderabad metro etc., Nuvama Institutional Equities expects L&amp;amp;T's margins to rise but at a slower pace. “Pickup in core E&amp;amp;C OPMs remains key to L&amp;amp;T,” the brokerage said in its preview report.

lt,2024-04-03T14:13:51+05:30,Rachita Prasad," MC Interview | Rs 1 lakh cr hydrocarbon order book gives revenue visibility, not worried about Saudi...","In a wide-ranging interview with Moneycontrol, Subramanian Sarma, spoke about opportunities emerging out of decarbonisation and energy transition, L&amp;T’s hiring strategy in the Middle East, and how the company is managing high attrition. ","Engineering major Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro’s hydrocarbon projects order book has crossed Rs 1 lakh crore, giving the company revenue visibility for the next two-and-a-half years. This also allows the company to be selective and focus on projects offering high margins, Subramanian Sarma, L&amp;amp;T’s head of energy businesses, told Moneycontrol in an interview.  While the recent deferment of big-ticket hydrocarbon orders in Saudi Arabia disappointed the Street, which was hoping that L&amp;amp;T would bag some of these orders, Sarma is not perturbed. His confidence stems from the company’s current order book and the fact that L&amp;amp;T is well placed to tap the new opportunities emerging in the sector even as its traditional fossil fuel market remains steady.  Sarma, who is also a whole-time director at L&amp;amp;T, is responsible for its hydrocarbon, power, green manufacturing and development projects.  He spoke about opportunities emerging out of decarbonisation and energy transition. Sarma also touched on L&amp;amp;T’s hiring strategy in the Middle East and how the company is stabilising despite witnessing high attrition.  Edited excerpts follow:  The global oil and gas industry’s capital expenditure for 2024 looks promising, according to data and experts' views. What is your assessment?  We are continuing to see some good opportunities both in the domestic and international markets. I think with the energy transition evolving now, people are assessing various alternative routes to reduce their carbon footprint. In that evolving scenario, very interestingly—for the hydrocarbon industry and for us—there are multiple opportunities. First, we continue to see opportunities in our conventional fossil fuel business with more emphasis on gas development, which is being seen as the fuel for the transition. Secondly, even if oil and gas producing companies want to diversify to non-oil and gas, they need capital. With the oil prices remaining at a decent level it provided the revenue stream needed to develop the new stream. There is little bit of urgency to monetise those assets. For these two reasons, we will see a good amount of capital allocation going into developing conventional fossil fuels.  Now, in addition to that, every organisation is also becoming quite responsible towards environmental issues and wants to reduce its carbon footprint. Even hardcore oil and gas companies are looking at ways to reduce their carbon footprint with blue ammonia, blue hydrogen, and carbon capture. These opportunities are coming up for new and old existing projects.  Thirdly, the long-term view taken by many of the oil and gas producing companies is that as the energy transition gains momentum and more electric vehicles and transportation fuel is needed, refineries have to be repurposed, because crude, which is used for producing refined products, will  have to now be used for chemicals and petrochemicals. There is huge potential for integrated petrochemical complexes and units oriented towards downstream chemicals. So, that is creating another set of opportunities. I have spent four decades in the industry, and this is perhaps the sweetest spot we have been in because we are able to address all these three evolving themes.  Your win rate has been 15-20% on the pipeline you bid for. Will this continue?   Our order book crossed Rs 1 lakh crore in December for hydrocarbons; this gives us a runway for two-and-a-half years. Our focus is always on strong execution because that is how we will remain profitable and secure more jobs by satisfying customers so that the win rate also can go up.  This provides an opportunity for us to be a little bit selective and to position ourselves the way we want. We are looking at future trends to pick up work in those areas that are going to be there in the long-term and are more strategic, like doing some carbon-capture large cracker projects like what we're doing in Barmer, Rajasthan, for HRRL (HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd). We will not just go after volume because we have enough; we have to focus on execution. We will pick up something that will give a decent growth, positioning and track record and opportunities to position ourselves for the future.  In January, Saudi Arabia directed state-owned Aramco to halt its plans to scale up capacity; the bid process for the $10-billion orders for Safaniya oilfield projects was canceled. In Algeria, some projects have not moved ahead. Would this impact the FY24 order inflow? Are there concerns about some of the mega projects not fructifying the way you had foreseen?  We have secured a very large volume of work in FY24. The jobs in Saudi and Algeria, the ones you mentioned, had they materialised it would have been the icing on the cake. But it was not that I needed those for my survival. When you are talking about large-scale capital investment, the momentum has been so large that you have to anticipate that some of them will get deferred or postponed because the customer is monitoring capacity in the industry and the supply chain. When they see the strains in the system, they try to reassess their priorities and some projects get deferred.  I think the press has made too much out of that announcement, forgetting that we had a record run.  Having said that, as I said, gas is a bridging fuel for the energy transition. The projects that got deferred were for oil development, which will undergo more scrutiny and it might get deferred. The project in Algeria will come back; these are normal trends with government transitions, elections, politics, and many other factors. All this is about timing and prioritisation of capital, we should not see anything more than that in this. These trends will continue but the opportunities are still quite huge.  What’s the ratio of oil and gas projects in your order book? Given the opportunities that you see, is there a possibility that this mix will change?  I don't have an exact number, but our portfolio mix in the international market is skewed more towards gas now because that is where the capital is being spent. Our win rate has been more on the gas projects. Notwithstanding that, in the future, it might change.  India is talking of increasing gas use but challenges regarding the availability of gas supply restricts the projects in the local market…   Yes, but gas development is more relevant to the international market; in India this opportunity is limited. There are some offshore gas developments of ONGC in the east coast and Reliance Industries, but we don't have that many gas reserves compared to our demand. We will have to rely on imports, but new opportunities might emerge. We may need more LNG receiving terminals and more regasification terminals as the economy grows and gas demand grows. Assuming that at some point in time gas prices also start falling in the international market, India may switch more and more towards gas as it is less carbon emitting.  How are the margins looking going ahead, considering raw material prices and intensifying competition?   The margins are in a similar range as what we have been seeing in the past. And our efforts are always to see how we can bring improvements. In this organisation, there is a huge emphasis and focus on improving the bottomline through fundamentally improving our execution efficiency, operational efficiency, using the latest technology, and getting better productivity. I think we have had some good successes; first thing is that we have been able to bring down our working capital. That’s a significant improvement from where we were two-three years back; that helps in the PAT.  Productivity and timeliness—these are the aspects where I can be more efficient and reduce cost leakages. There's a lot of effort going on in using technology to improve that. As for competition, not much has changed; it is pretty much the same players. Everyone will be a little bit more selective, so hopefully it will give us an opportunity to pick up jobs at a better margin. We’ll have to see how it evolves. But you will always find some dark horse who is desperate and customers also would like to have a dark horse in the bidding list.  When you say the same margin level, what does that mean?   I don't know what numbers because there are analysts margins and operative margins; these are different definitions. But, let me say that we will remain in the same range, at around 9-10% PBIT.  L&amp;amp;T CFO R Shankar Raman told Moneycontrol earlier that Saudi Arabia is emerging as a wider play for L&amp;amp;T, like India. What’s the hiring strategy in the Middle East?  There are two aspects to it. One is that there is a requirement, like our Atmanirbharta, that as we increase local contracts, we are required to engage more and more Saudi nationals. That is happening as it is a contractual requirement. And two, as RSR said, the volume of business is so large that we are taking a medium- to long-term view with respect to how we want to operate in that country. It is always nice to go beyond the contractual requirement in hiring people; there is good talent available. We are adding more talent for the operations and some of them also come to India for training.  I think last year (2023) we saw some high attrition—people were moving around. It has stabilised and we are putting in efforts to see how we can attract more people. L&amp;amp;T has now been rated as a great place to work, which is another shot in the arm.  Attrition has remained high. Why?   It’s just an industry phenomenon. I think it's nothing particular to us. Sometimes we face that situation but it is also stabilising.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-interview-rs-1-lakh-cr-hydrocarbon-order-book-gives-revenue-visibility-not-worried-about-saudi-project-deferment-lt-energy-head-12567441.html

The current investment boom by Saudi Arabia has benefitted from the ties and from the fact that Indian companies had set shop in the region in time to capture the potential. ,"Saudi Arabia’s ambitious blueprint for economic development, called Vision 2030, has been fuelling the order books of Indian infrastructure companies for the past five years and is expected to play a significant role in going forward as well.  Engineering major Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro has seen a surge in orders from Saudi Arabia, which now accounts for 80-90 percent of its overseas orders. Other engineering, procurement and construction companies have bagged jobs too for infrastructure, hydrocarbon, and construction projects.  Last week, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry took a delegation of chief executive officers to Saudi Arabia, where more than 500 Indian companies are operating, with investments of more than $2 billion. Saudi Arabia's investments in India exceeded $3.3 billion in various economic and commercial sectors.  During their visit, FICCI secretary-general SK Pathak highlighted that Indian companies are playing a large role in the development of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, especially for projects in NEOM, the urban area being built in the country.  &quot;This is just the beginning,&quot; Pathak said. &quot;The entire NEOM city is phased over a trillion dollars. Indian companies will get a large share of that.&quot;  According to Saleh bin Eid Al Hussain, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to India, Saudi Arabia is also the fourth-largest trading partner of India, while India is the second-largest trading partner of Saudi Arabia. Bilateral trade was close to $43 billion in FY23, with imports from Saudi Arabia worth about $30 billion.  During FY15, bilateral trade stood at about $39.4 billion, comprised mostly of imports from Saudi Arabia of $28.2 billion.   A few of the biggest infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia won by Indian companies  Ties between the two nations have transformed significantly in recent years.  &quot;The decade-plus experience Indian companies have in West Asian countries has added to the confidence of foreign governments in Indian companies and has helped boost project awarding to Indian firms,&quot; Afaq Hussain, director and founding member of the Bureau of Research on Industry and Economic Fundamentals (BRIEF), told Moneycontrol.  Hussain added that Indian companies have proved their capability to live up to the technical standards of new tenders emerging out of West Asian countries.  Pinak R Chakravarty, former secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs, told Moneycontrol that India's development over the past decades and the increasing technical complexity of infrastructure projects executed in India over the same time has demonstrated the capability of Indian companies when it comes to global tenders.  &quot;Projects like the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Delhi Metro and others have highlighted the capabilities of Indian infrastructure companies to the world,&quot; Chakravarty said.  What is also notable is that as compared to the early 2010s, more Indian infrastructure companies are qualifying for global tenders, not just in Saudi Arabia but across the world as they increasingly adopt global standards, industry executives said.  A senior executive from an infrastructure conglomerate operating in both India and Saudi Arabia said, “Back in 2011-2012, global tenders would have one big name from India. But if you look at recent tenders, out of 10 companies that would have bid for the tender, four to five will be an Indian company or a company working with an Indian partner.”  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro's chief financial officer R Shankar Raman told Moneycontrol in an interview on February 3 that the company has a $15-16 billion order book from Saudi Arabia, of which a significant portion is from Aramco, the world's largest oil and gas company.  He added that the overall market potential of the Kingdom is about $250 billion a year.  Vimal Kejriwal, MD &amp;amp; CEO of KEC International, told Moneycontrol that it is eyeing transmission and distribution projects in Saudi Arabia, which is the largest export contributor to the company's Rs 38,000 crore order book.  Way Ahead  Indian companies are also awaiting more opportunities from joint working groups (JWG) of the two countries to channelise the $100 billion in investments promised by the Saudi side during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud's visit to India in February 2019.  Closer home, the $50 billion West Coast refinery in India, a mega plant to be set up by Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Indian companies is expected to be a major project that can benefit Indian companies.  India and Saudi Arabia have set up a Strategic Partnership Council (SPC), co-chaired by the Prime Minister of India and the Crown Prince of the Kingdom, which is revving up bilateral relations. The SPC covers various sectors of cooperation and has two committees headed by ministers - one on political, security, social, and cultural cooperation and one on economy and investments.  Under these two pillars, there are eight joint working groups. The economy and investment pillar consists of four working groups covering industry and infrastructure; agriculture and food security; IT and technology; and energy.  The first summit of the SPC took place during the state visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on September 11, 2023. The meeting marked a new milestone in India-Saudi bilateral ties and underlined burgeoning commercial engagements.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/saudi-arabias-vision-2030-fuels-order-books-of-indias-infrastructure-companies-12375211.html

The induction ceremony took place at the Manekshaw Centre here in the presence of Army chief General Manoj Pande and senior officials of the Army and Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T).  &quot;Over the next four years, a total of 41 sets, valued at Rs 2,585 crore, will be progressively inducted. The first set was inducted on Tuesday,&quot; a senior official said. These &quot;game-changing bridges&quot; have been designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and produced by L&amp;amp;T as a DRDO-nominated production agency.  The modular bridge is a &quot;mechanically-launched single-span, fully-decked 46-metre assault bridge, enabling the Army to overcome obstacles, such as canals and ditches, with ease. It will augment the crucial bridging capability of the Indian Army's engineers as these bridges are highly mobile, rugged, and designed for quick deployment and retrieval, aligning with the fast-paced nature of mechanised operations,&quot; the official said. The induction of the modular bridge also highlights India's &quot;prowess in designing and developing advanced military equipment&quot; and underscores the country's commitment to &quot;Aatmanirbhar Bharat&quot; and self-reliance in defence production, the Army said.  The contract for the procurement of the modular bridges was signed with L&amp;amp;T in February 2023. Each set of the modular bridge consists of &quot;seven carrier vehicles based on 8×8 heavy mobility vehicles and two launcher vehicles based on 10×10 heavy mobility vehicles&quot;, the Army said.  These bridges can be employed over various types of obstacles like canals and ditches with quick launching and retrieval capabilities. The equipment is highly mobile, versatile, rugged and capable of keeping pace with wheeled and tracked mechanised vehicles, it added. The modular bridges will replace the manually-launched medium girder bridges (MGBs) that are currently being used in the Army. The indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridges shall have many advantages over the MGBs, such as an increased span, less time for construction and mechanical launching with retrieval capability, officials said.  The acquisition of these bridges not only enhances the Army's operational effectiveness, but also showcases India's growing prominence in defence technology and manufacturing, they said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indigenously-designed-and-manufactured-modular-bridge-inducted-into-indian-army-12363741.html

On the other hand, investments in digital infrastructure, skill upgradation, job creation, and MSME development are expected from the budget which will help consumption spending in rural areas. This is a positive for ITC's FMCG vertical which is currently facing a demand slowdown in rural areas.  NTPC (CMP: Rs 318) According to the Central Electricity Authority, India's peak power demand will cross the 260 GW mark in 2025-26 and hit 277 GW by 2026-27. As more capacity is added to meet this demand, NTPC will be the biggest beneficiary. NTPC is India's largest integrated power utility company, contributing 25 percent of the country's power requirement currently.  Further, incentives for operational improvement of state DISCOMS and announcements to promote renewable energy will also bode well for the stock.

So, any boost to these sector will bode well for cement stocks as well. &quot;Furthermore, under the National Infrastructure Plan, the government has plans to enhance India's infrastructure which will expedite highway projects. This is expected to increase demand for cement,&quot; said Axis Securities.  Reliance Industries (CMP: Rs 2,850) Reliance Industries, the second biggest weight on the Nifty 50, stands to benefit from several budget announcements, especially the ones pertaining to green energy, battery and solar PLI schemes. According to Bernstein, Reliance may earn nearly $10-15 billion from its new energy business spanning solar to hydrogen by 2030.  With close to 10 percent gain over the past one month, the stock has been supporting the index. Investors will be watchful if the stock can surpass Rs 2900 on budget day and maintain that level.  HDFC Bank (CMP: Rs 1,462) Though no big bang announcements are expected for the banking sector, HDFC Bank will be on the radar by the virtue of its sheer weight. As of December end, the stock had 13.52 percent weight on the index.  The stock will also be in focus as the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announces fiscal deficit targets for FY25. The Street expects fiscal defcit target for the next financial year at 5.3 percent. Furthermore, the stock can benefit from housing and MSME incentives as well.  HUL (CMP: Rs 2,475) and Maruti Suzuki (CMP: Rs 10,161)  Consumption-related stocks stand to gain if the finance minister announces any tweaks to income tax slabs, resulting in more disposable income in the hands of consumers. Maruti Suzuki also stands to gain from incremental announcements related to auto PLI and FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid &amp;amp; Electric Vehicles) schemes. Meanwhile, HUL might move higher if significant announcements are made to support rural economy.

What to watch, key levels",Here's what experts recommend investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading on Budget day.,"The market is anticipated to be volatile on budget day due to expected announcements from the Finance Minister across various sectors. Experts are closely watching the fiscal consolidation path and GDP growth estimates. With India's strong economic growth, all eyes are on the interim budget, especially ahead of general elections.  The market recently saw a recovery, facing resistance at 21,800-21,850, with 21,500 as a support area. Broader markets outperformed benchmarks, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index gaining 1.6 percent and Smallcap 100 index rising 2.25 percent, maintaining a volatility level around 16.  Moneycontrol has selected 13 budget sensitive stocks, which have given healthy returns in the past several quarters/months. These are Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, KEC International, Siemens, NTPC, REC, Hindustan Aeronautics, Macrotech Developers, Aptus Value Housing Finance, Container Corporation of India, Amber Enterprises India, National Fertilisers, Rail Vikas Nigam, and IRCON International.  Here's what experts recommend investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading on Budget day:  Expert: Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder / CEO at Waves Strategy Advisors  REC  REC has formed a bullish candle on daily time frame and closed with a gain of 1.42 percent on January 31. Despite of negative opening stock rebounded from important support area and managed to close near day’s high which is indicating strength in this stock.  The stock has successfully defended Rs 482 level, which was the previous swing level. Rs 482 can now act as crucial support for the stock. Price continued its move higher with the upper band and since past 5 trading sessions has not given any close below its previous day’s low which keeps the tone positive.  In short, REC looks bullish. A breach above Rs 505 can lift price higher towards Rs 525 level as far as stock holds Rs 482 level on the downside.    Hindustan Aeronautics  HAL is moving up in higher high higher low formation. However, currently prices are consolidating within a range of Rs 2,830-3,060. Bollinger bands have squeezed and a trending move is much awaited. A decisive break above Rs 3,060 is must for fresh buying to emerge.  A decisive break of the mentioned range can result into a trending move. ADX (average directional index) is also suggesting rangebound move as it is showing reading of 20. The low readings of ADX indicates that the stock is in a range. If ADX trades above 25 then it can result into a trending move.  In short, HAL is likely to trade in a broader range of Rs 2,830-3,060. A break above Rs 3,060 can lift the price higher towards Rs 3,200 with support near Rs 2,830 level.    NTPC  NTPC is trading near record high levels. Price is forming higher highs and higher lows which keeps the tone positive for the stock. However, price is facing resistance near Rs 320 levels. A breach above this level will resume further upside move to Rs 330.  Immediate support on downside is near Rs 310 level. As long as prices stay above 35-day exponential moving average trend remains bullish.  In short, NTPC is bullish. Move above Rs 320 will resume positive trend to Rs 335 levels with support at Rs 310 levels.

In addition, the monthly price action has resulted in a &quot;Doji&quot; candlestick pattern representing a short term pause in its bullish trend. As the primary still intact bullish, investors are advised to utilise such small corrections towards the support zone as a buying opportunity.  The &quot;bullish gap&quot; formed on December 4, 2023 within Rs 3,250-3,197 levels will act as a crucial support zone. On the upside, the stock may extend its rally towards Rs 4,100-4,280 levels in upcoming months.  We recommend investors to hold long positions with a crucial support zone of Rs 3,330-3,250 levels.

Revenue zoomed to Rs 55,128 crore, 19 percent higher from last year, the company said in an exchange filing on January 30.  The numbers were lower than market expectations.  An average of estimates of four brokerages pegged the diversified conglomerate to report an over 30 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in profit at Rs 3,324.3 crore. Revenue was expected to grow 20 percent to Rs 55,720 crore on the strength of a strong order book.  L&amp;amp;T won orders worth Rs 75,990 crore at the group level during Q3, logging a 25.2 percent growth over the corresponding quarter of the previous year when it had won orders worth Rs 60,710 crore.  During the reporting quarter, orders were received across multiple segments, including public spaces, nuclear power, and the irrigation, ferrous metal, health, renewables and refinery sectors, the company said in a press release.

The company's Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at Rs 5,760 crore during the quarter 14 percent higher on year, but lower than market expectations.  Analysts had expected the company's EBITDA to grow 22 percent from a year ago, to around Rs 6,178 crore for the reporting period.  Infrastructure Projects Segment  Segment-wise, L&amp;amp;T’s infrastructure projects segment secured order inflows of Rs 43,208 crore, during the quarter that ended December 31, 2023, which was 33 percent higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year.  The segment order book stood at Rs 317,693 crore as on December 31, 2023, with the share of international orders at 28 percent.  Revenues from the segment rose 27 percent on year to Rs 28,266 crore while profit from the segment fell 7.6 percent on year to Rs 1205.41 crore.  The fall in profit was mainly on account of a fall in operating profit margin from the segment which fell to 5.5 percent in Q3FY24 from 7 percent in the same period a year ago.  L&amp;amp;T's infrastructure projects segment had seen a sequential fall in operating margins for the seven quarters as the company won infrastructure projects at very aggressive prices after the post-COVID-19, post-Russia-Ukraine (conflict) period in 2022-23.  The company's chief financial officer R Shankar Raman Raman said that L&amp;amp;T expects its operating margin to start improving from the next financial year as orders won at aggressive prices in 2022-23 will complete execution and new orders start being carried out.  At the end of June 2023, around 35-40 percent of L&amp;amp;T's then order book of Rs 3,01,159 crore from the infrastructure projects segment was made up of orders that were won at aggressive prices.  Energy Projects Segment  L&amp;amp;T secured order inflows of Rs 13,281 crore in this segment, during the quarter that ended December 31, 2023, which was nearly 47 percent higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year when the company had won orders worth Rs 9,051 crore.

Revenues from the segment rose 24 percent on year to Rs 7870.30 crore while profit from the segment rose 40 percent on year to Rs 695.21 crore.  The EBITDA margin of the segment came in at 9.7 percent for the quarter that ended December 31, 2023, improved compared to 8.7 percent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year, mainly on account of job savings in hydrocarbon and customer claim settlements in the power business.  Hi-Tech Manufacturing Segment  L&amp;amp;T secured order inflows of Rs 2,043 crore in this segment, during the quarter that ended December 31, 2023, which was 6 percent higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year.  The Hi-Tech Manufacturing Segment order book stood at Rs 25,758 crore as of December 31, 2023, with the international order book constituting 8 percent.  Raman said that order inflow in the company's Hi-Tech Manufacturing segment has been slow in the first half of FY24 due to the delays in the government awarding defense contracts.  &quot;Going forward we expect the government to aggressively come out with defense orders which will help order inflow of our Hi-Tech Manufacturing segment,&quot; Raman said.  Revenues from the segment rose 17.3 percent on year to Rs 2,184.70 crore while profit from the segment rose 18.9 percent on year to Rs 294.78 crore.  IT &amp;amp; Technology Services Segment  L&amp;amp;T's revenues from this segment rose to Rs 11,325 crore in this segment, during the quarter that ended December 31, 2023, which was 5.7 percent higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

The segment margin improved due to improved utilization levels in LTIMindtree.  OUTLOOK  Going forward, L&amp;amp;T expects public capital expenditure to witness a temporary slowdown due to the general elections in 2024.  L&amp;amp;T added that the global economy remains volatile with continuing military engagement in Europe and West Asia, disrupting the supply chain and global trade movements.  &quot;The US economy has been resilient so far, but the UK and European economies are weak and the concern around China persists,&quot; the company said.  The conglomerate expects West Asian countries particularly Saudi Arabia to continue to pursue their ambitious growth plans in both energy and other sectors.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/lt-q3-results-net-profit-rises-15-to-rs-2947-crore-misses-estimates-12150541.html

lt,2023-11-12T11:41:58+05:30,Navisha Joshi,"Larsen &amp; Toubro, SBI, Coromandel among ICICI Direct’s top bets this Diwali","For the Diwali 2023 season, ICICI Direct’s analysts pick 7 stocks that may see a boost in their values. Here's the list:"," Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro | CMP Rs. 2918 | TP Rs. 3560 | L&amp;amp;T's operations encompass various sectors with a significant order backlog of Rs450,000 crore (up 22 percent YoY in Q2FY24) and a Rs8.8 trillion project pipeline. The company expects a growth of 15 percent in order inflow for FY24, along with a strong revenue outlook for the next 2-3 years. With the Infrastructure segment contributing to 47 percent of the consolidated revenue and services accounting for 32 percent, L&amp;amp;T holds a prominent position in India's capital expenditure narrative. Analysts expect an 18.6 percent and 26.5 percent CAGR in revenue and PAT respectively, for FY23-FY25E. The strategic focus on services, including IT and Finance, serves as a safeguard for cash flows, thus mitigating cyclical risks. L&amp;amp;T's aim for 18 percent ROE by 2026 through selective profitable growth, asset monetization, and stable balance sheets makes it an attractive investment option.   State Bank of India | CMP Rs. 572 | TP Rs. 725 | SBI reported a strong balance sheet exceeding Rs55 lakh crore for FY23. Its future business expansion goals align with the expected credit growth of 14-15 percent in FY24E, driven by a comprehensive approach to lending, particularly in the MSME and retail segments. While the bank may face margin pressure in FY24E due to a gradual increase in yields, its resilient asset quality, with GNPA/NNPA at 2.76 percent/0.71 percent and a restructured book at approximately 70 bps, maintaining favorable credit costs at around 30-50 bps. SBI's consistent performance, along with management's confidence in growth, steady margins, and return ratios at around 1 percent in FY24-25E, will help improve the RoE to approximately 16-17 percent. However, key risks include the potential for increased deposit costs due to competition and slower disbursement traction in the corporate segment.   Coromandel International | CMP Rs. 1058 | TP Rs. 1330 | Coromandel holds a 17.2 percent market share based on consumption in the NPK &amp;amp; DAP segment, and a 13.8 percent market share in single super phosphate (SSP). The company has a strong portfolio with a global presence spanning 81 countries and a Nutrient &amp;amp; other allied: crop protection ratio of 91:9 in FY23.Coromandel's strategic investment plan of Rs1000 crore over the next two years, particularly in Agrochemicals CDMO, aligns with favorable trends in the chemicals sector. Innovations like the Nano DAP tech product, coupled with efforts to upstream integration and a new sulphuric acid plant, signify its commitment to technological progress. The annual production capacity of approximately 4.5 million tons positions Coromandel for future expansion, while key risks include adverse weather conditions, government policies, and fluctuations in crude prices that may impact industry dynamics.   Spandana Sphoorthy Financial | CMP Rs. 867 | TP Rs. 1100 | Spandana Sphoorthy's strategic shift towards a collection model that prioritizes customers and employees and expansion initiatives, have led to an increased customer base of 27 lakhs. The new management aims for a 35-40 percent growth in AUM with focus on customer acquisition and a steady average ticket size. Through diversifying its liabilities mix, enhanced credit rating, and commitment to acquiring quality customers, Spandana Sphoorthy has mitigated the impact of rising interest rates with stable margins in the FY24-25. The recovery in asset quality, with GNPA at 1.4 percent as of September and a stage 3 coverage of 70.3 percent, maintains credit costs at 2 percent going forward. The stock is expected to drive a healthy RoA of over 4.5 percent, with potential risks including volatility in repayment buckets and a moderation in growth due to external factors.   Century Plyboards | CMP Rs. 607 | TP Rs. 750 | With a market share of 25 percent, Century Plyboard's revenue stream is primarily driven by plywood (56 percent), laminates (18 percent), and MDF (18 percent). Despite facing challenges in H1FY24, it has demonstrated resilience with analysts predicting a CAGR of approximately 15 percent in revenues over FY23-25, supported by robust growth in MDF (31 percent CAGR), laminates (15 percent CAGR), and plywood (11 percent CAGR). Although there has been a temporary decline in margins in FY24, it is expected to rebound to normalized levels (16.2 percent) in FY25, driving a CAGR of around 19.2 percent in earnings along with the retained net debt-free status. Century Plyboards is committed to funding its capital expenditures internally, and the company's strategic expansion plans and diversified market positioning support the target price based on a 32x FY25 price-to-earnings ratio.   Bharat Dynamics | CMP Rs. 1001 | TP Rs. 1260 | BDL is well-positioned to benefit from the government's focus on indigenous capabilities, owing to its dedication towards enhancing market competitiveness through continuous investments in R&amp;amp;D, global partnerships, and infrastructure expansion. With a robust order backlog of approximately Rs23,500 crore (11.3x TTM revenues) and a strong pipeline for missiles, torpedoes, and countermeasures over the next 3-5 years, BDL provides clear visibility of future revenue growth and profitability. The stock's potential in export markets is driven by cost advantages and growing interest from friendly nations. Forecasts of a 53 percent CAGR in profit after tax (PAT) for FY23-25E, attributed to improved execution and margins, with favorable return ratios, contribute to the positive outlook. Despite risks such as reliance on government contracts and foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for critical components, BDL represents a 28x FY25E EPS.   TV Today Networks | CMP Rs. 193 | TP Rs. 260 | Despite difficulties within the advertising landscape, TV Today Network expects substantial recovery in ad revenue growth set to occur in H2FY24 driven by the onset of the festival season and a surge in election-related expenditures in Q4FY24/Q1FY25. Analysts forecast a 9 percent CAGR in revenue for the period of FY23-25, with a 15 percent expansion following a relatively stagnant H1FY24. The consolidation of entities will result in an improvement in profit margins, with a targeted increase to 18 percent by FY25, compared to the existing 15.5 percent in FY23. Given its prominent role in election-driven advertising expenditure, the stock is an attractive investment opportunity with a valuation of 12X the FY25 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio with potential risks including a decline in market share and elevated digital expenses.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/photos/business/stocks/larsen-toubro-sbi-coromandel-among-icici-directs-top-bets-this-diwali-11720871.html

They have hiked their FY2024 and FY2025 PAT estimates by 12 percent and 10 percent, respectively, and raised their target price from Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 with a valuation of 18x EV/EBITDA -- up from the previous 15x due to the enhanced order outlook and growing order book.  For the quarter ending September 2023, L&amp;amp;T saw an order inflow of Rs 1,54,672 crore, around 65 percent higher, compared to Q2FY23's Rs 93,720 crore.  “We believe there could be positive surprises if mega order awarding continues, as average ticket sizes of international hydrocarbon projects are greater than $1 billion,” Elara Capital said regarding L&amp;amp;T’s order book.

The firm expects L&amp;amp;T’s growth to moderate in the second half of 2024.  Even so, it has upgraded the stock from an ‘accumulate’ to ‘buy’ call with a revised target price from Rs 3,041 to Rs 3,540. “Over FY2023-2026E, we expect a consolidated revenue CAGR of 13 percent, an EBITDA CAGR of 15 percent, and a PAT CAGR of 18 percent.

While analysts expected guidance upgrades, given the uncertain geopolitical issues and the upcoming Indian election, L&amp;amp;T has kept guidance open-ended, with a positive bias towards surpassing the same.  L&amp;amp;T margins seen improving  Analysts at HDFC Securities have maintained the ‘buy’ call and target price (Rs 3,613), given the record-high order book, bottoming out of infra margins, improvement in subsidiary performance and higher public capex towards a green economy.  ICICI Securities has also listed L&amp;amp;T as their top pick and maintained a ‘buy’ call (target price of Rs 3,600, up from Rs 3,141) on the stock.  While margins for the core business remain sub-par, analysts at ICICI Securities believe there will be an improvement in H2 with the completion of legacy orders. “Net working capital continues to show steady improvement. The completion of the buyback (announced in September 2023) will likely improve RoE from FY2024E onwards,” the report said.

lt,2023-11-02T07:28:34+05:30,Rachita Prasad,MC Interview | Saudi Arabia has become a wider play like India for us: L&amp;T CFO,"L&amp;T CFO talks about how Mumbai infrastructure is stretched and it can't be the panacea to “every empty stomach”. There is need to shift jobs elsewhere too, he says. ","Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro beat street estimates on most financial parameters in the second quarter of 2023-24 and expects to exceed its sales and order inflow guidance for the fiscal.  In a freewheeling interview with Moneycontrol, Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman talks about the way ahead, how Saudi Arabia is emerging as a broad based market for the company and how it is dealing with headwinds in the information technology industry.  Speaking on the deteriorating air quality in Mumbai, Raman, whose company is executing some of the mega projects in the financial capital, says that the pollution cannot be attributed to the increased construction activities.  &quot;Mumbai cannot be the panacea to every empty stomach, jobs need to be shifted elsewhere as well,&quot; Raman said, highlighting the need for better urban planning.  Read edited excerpts of the interview here:  Q. At the start of 2023-24, L&amp;amp;T had given revenue growth guidance at 12-15 percent and order intake growth at 10-12 percent. Now given that your order inflow in FY23 was Rs 2 lakh crore, you have already hit the mid-way mark in H1. During the media call you said that you expect to exceed the guidance; can you put a number to that?  In the first six months of the year, we saw significant order wins in the Middle East, almost two-thirds of the order in the second quarter was from the Middle East; in the six months period it was almost 55-56%. Of this, 90% of the orders from the Middle East are from Saudi Arabia. Typically, these orders are very large and lumpy. So it is difficult to assess how it will be for the rest of the year. These big and lumpy orders are outliers, but it is an important win for us, because it endorses the capability of the company and enables the company to operate at a much higher league than the opportunities that India provides us.  In the six-month period, the domestic orders have grown by 15% in contrast to the international orders which have grown by over two and a half times. Our sense is that the domestic orders will start moving forward, because looking at the prospects of about Rs 8.5 lakh crore that we have almost Rs 5 lakh crore in the area of infrastructure alone. It remains to be seen as to what is the intensity, frequency with which these opportunities are put out as bids, tendered out and selected and awarded. I think to expect such lumpy orders in Q3 and Q4 and hence take the order inflow guidance for the year into a stratospheric level becomes a bit of a challenge. All that we are able to assess now is that looking at the way we are positioned number-wise at the end of H1, it is very likely that we will outperform the 10 to 12% order inflow guidance that we have given for the year quite handsomely. The guidance is a kind of a goalpost that we set for ourselves for the year as a whole. I don't think it's a good idea for us to keep shifting that goalpost, because I think we all as a company get confused as to what it is that we are chasing. So the goalpost remains the same. So both in terms of order inflow and revenue growth, we are expected to outperform the guidance quite well.  Q. In Q2FY24, L&amp;amp;T exceeded street estimates on most financial parameters. The only dampener was the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin which declined to 11% from 11.4% a year ago. You have mentioned earlier that the decline is due to the pre-COVID legacy orders which are being executed at post-COVID raw material prices. For the rest of the year, where are the margins headed and how much more of these legacy orders are left in the order book?  It will progressively improve in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and in FY24-25 you will see us return to more normalized levels of margin. Even though we don’t look at the quarter-on-quarter basis, the infrastructure segment reported a 5.1% margin in Q1 which improved to 5.4% in Q2. I expect this to keep migrating upwards to its potential of 7% over time. The overall margins of our manufacturing and services segment is at 7.4% today and was at the same levels as Q1 margin. The guidance was that it will move up to 9% from the 8.6% we reported last year. The effort between Q3 and Q4 is to get this 7.4% up as much as we can. Our assessment tells us looking at the way projects are positioned for execution, that we should be landing up at the end of the year anywhere between the margins we reported last year and the goal that we have set for ourselves as 9%; it could be anywhere between 8.5 to 9%. And what the market is reading as rerating downwards of the guidance is the them looking at a target of 9%. But I just want to elaborate and clarify that we never said 9%, we always said that we would like to move up from 8.6 to 9%, which is working our way up for about 40 basis points. We're still saying the same thing, except we're saying that it could be anywhere between 8.5 and 9% and not at the higher end of the band. We will wait and watch global interferences like wars, but our effort would be to keep pushing towards our goal.  Q. We can’t even fathom the human aspect of the Israel-Hamas war. But from a business point of view, with almost 80% of your international orders coming from Saudi Arabia, how are you viewing it?  Saudi has been a good market for us, because we are benefiting from their Vision 2030. The kingdom today wants to reposition Saudi from just being an oil and gas exporter to a much larger economic play. They're building not only the energy part of the business, but also several other parts of the business and we are benefiting from all of those. We are a large participant in their energy transition, in solar energy and we are participating in their projects for recreating cities and building new ones. Saudi has become a wider play like India is for us. We participate in several areas. Fortunately for us, in the strife that Israel is currently caught in, the Saudi's participation at the ground level is very low key. Geopolitically, I wouldn't know as to how the palace and the kingdom is thinking about this, but the things on the ground seem to suggest that it is fairly secure in terms of its project execution time schedules. The war is already two weeks old, and we have not seen any interruption. We do believe Saudi's slant towards participation will be low key, because they have to strike between the political stance and the economic development, which seems to be tilting in favor of economic development now.  Q. You mentioned in the media call after the result on October 31 that the information technology and technology services (IT&amp;amp;TS) business is facing headwinds, much like your competitors. How is the environment looking going ahead? Are you going slow on hiring?   The IT clients and engineering technology clients are very different species. The technology clients are actually proceeding with their program, which improves the functionality of their end products. To stay ahead in technology for their own competitiveness becomes a compelling reason for them to continue to outsource engineering technology work. L&amp;amp;T Technology Services, which is more into embedded engineering, is in a better place comparatively speaking as compared to commercial IT for the next 6-12 months. Commercial IT has a fair bit of discretionary spend. A lot of money was spent in migrating the data from on-premises servers to cloud etc. We did benefit from that move and bagged a fair bit of orders as businesses, particularly post-pandemic, started resorting more and more to internet-based transactions. That phase will slow down a bit now because people would possibly like to reassess as to how that spent that they have done on that area is going to pay out for them. But insofar as regulatory compliances, financial services, and essential services go, we will continue to see traction. Except that given the overall slowdown in the IT spend, the competitive intensity has increased.  The clients also obviously will take advantage of this situation and in putting out projects more and more based on outcome. In the sense that it is not going to be hiring for time and material spend, but it is also going to be part of the compensation that will come out of the outcome we achieve. If there is a productivity improvement IT project that we are doing, we have to establish productivity and share the upside with the customer. Now this is a trend globally and all IT companies will have to reposition their business models and we are doing that as well. So in a way, it is an investment-led IT growth. This transition between just mass hiring for time and material to outcome-based is an inflection point in the industry and I think that's what the industry is going through. We have grown by 7% for the quarter and 10% on year. But this is not the same as 15% and 20% growth levels that we saw 2-3 quarters before. We think it will settle down, because we are inextricably connected to technology in the way we work and conduct our business. The discretionary part will become a compulsory part of business existence. We have already scaled up and are almost the fifth in that list of IT companies serving out of India. We will continue to work on our competency.  When we talk about staffing, I think it is just not the question of how much compensation we need to pay to people, we need to have people of the right skill set as well as transiting towards AI and all the related technological developments. We need to re-skill our people. People who wrote the normal COBOL code will not be useful today, because of the evolution that has happened. So the investment that we need to make in talent, which will enable the industry to help our clients move to the next 5 -10 years is something that the industry is talking about. We are also talking about it and augmenting the resources of the right kind. We also have to balance between the pyramid, because we need to have a good amount of lower band of people who will cost less, but who will do the grunt work within this space and then we will have to build business leadership and technology leadership on top of that.  Q. In your developmental projects business, you are working on improving the performance of Nabha Power plant and Hyderabad metro projects with the intent of finally divesting. How far are we from going forward with the divestment?  The good news is that on a quarter-on-quarter basis, we are improving the profile and economic prospects of the project. The effort would be to receive the full tranche of Rs 3,000 crores soft loan from the Government of Telangana for Hyderabad Metro; it’s a no interest long-duration loan being used to reduce the commercial borrowings taken for the project. It was also important for us to actually start selling land parcels attached to the metro project and we made a successful start in the quarter that just ended by selling almost 17 acres. It did take a long time to get the consent of the government and authorities to be able to do that and now that we have done with one parcel, we should continue to look at other alternate parcels and make sure that the land value is unlocked. The value that we will realize by selling this land, apart from it generating some profits, will also help us unlock value which can be used to repay the debt. Ridership which has been improving very steadily month-on-month. Today, on every working day more than 5 lakh people travel and one year before this number was 3.5-3.8 lakh; there has been a tremendous improvement on that and we hope that as more and more organizations ask people to report back to work, this will increase. And thirdly, the Telangana Government has come up with the proposal for expanding the railroad network. We are not going to be a sponsor of that project, but we will get an opportunity to build it if we are competitive. That will help to complete the feeder networks for this project as well and this project will benefit from that larger network development. Consequently, sale of land, using the proceeds to repay debt, increasing ridership, getting the soft loan and repaying debt. All of that will enable the project profile to significantly improve from where it is today. In two years, possibly two and a half years from now, we should be able to make a proposition for this project as an attractive investment to funds, maybe sovereign wealth funds or private equity funds. Or some other REIT investors. We will have to figure out who at that point in time would be the interested suitors. But we're definitely moving towards that. Once we make the project healthy, we are confident that we should be able to find attractive investors. We are still operating at the first tariff that was fixed. The tariff fixation committee has recommended that the project is due for a revision. So maybe we will identify the right time window for us to announce the revision as well. So that'll also add to the viability of the project significantly.  Q. Last few weeks, Mumbai has seen poor air quality, which is in part being attributed to the high level of construction work going on in the city. L&amp;amp;T is involved with some of the biggest projects in the city- be it the coastal road project or metro work. What is your assessment of the situation, how much of the pollution is actually coming from infrastructure? What measures are you taking to ensure that at least you are not contributing to the pollution?  We have been working with the government for several months now on a pro-bono basis to improve the pollution level and minimize the disruption that construction activity causes to the city of Mumbai, because so much of our contracts are under execution. We do believe that we are an important stakeholder in this. As a company, even before the smog became an issue of debate and inviting attention of central government and local authorities, we have been in our sites practicing several processes to make it easy for our own workmen working there. We have been making need-based efforts on our sites; we use water sprinklers quite regularly and use wet cloths to absorb the dust particles. We use barricades; you will find the quality difference between the barricades that we use for our sites versus what somebody else uses. All of this costs extra money, and the contract does not provide for it. It's a question of whether we believe that we have to provide the right environment for our workers to do and the costs that we incur will get repaid by the improved productivity and lesser fatality and better safety. That's the belief with which we work.  Many of the things that the government has come out with as an announcement are nothing but practices that L&amp;amp;T is following. And we have also shared this with the government saying that these are the things that should be made mandatory for all the contractors who work in the city of Mumbai. We do believe half of the problem lies with the construction and half of it lies with the pollution caused by emissions of other kind. I mean look at the traffic congestion and look at the state of roads. The state of roads adds to more time, more hours on the road and more hours on the road means more fuel being burnt and pollution being created. Construction seems to be an easy target, because it's most visible. But equal measure the vehicle pollution is also something that we need to bother about. Third, I think, in the quest for real estate development, the authorities that approve all this are in some sense changing the tree line of Mumbai, the greenery is shifting. For example, a company like us has planted almost 2 million saplings in the half-year ended 30th September alone, because we are conscious of the fact that we are destroying so much of greenery to build all the infrastructure. But this is not a uniform practice in the industry.  And also the authorities that when they give sanctions for projects, especially the residential, commercial real estate, etc. The amount of trees that get felled and not adequately replaced is something that the authorities will also have to think about. There is something like capacity for every city. Mumbai seems to be like a sponge, it absorbs more and more and more. It has been going on for the last 50 years. Now there comes a time where the city has to expand to other corners for which jobs have to move there. The larger issue is that city planners will have to take into account that Mumbai cannot be the panacea of every hungry stomach. We have to figure out a way to deal with this better. But I can only assure you that what the government is putting out as standard operating practices are what we have shared with the government as our practices.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/mc-interview-saudi-arabia-has-become-a-wider-play-like-india-for-us-lt-cfo-11646531.html

Raman added that going forward, L&amp;amp;T will work towards receiving a total of Rs 3,000 crore of soft loan from the Andhra Pradesh government which will be used to repay the debt of the project.  He also said that the daily ridership of Hyderabad Metro has risen to a peak of around 5.5 lakh passengers in the quarter ended September 2023 from 5 lakh daily passengers in the previous quarter, and around 3.5-3.8 lakh daily passengers a year ago.  Raman had last year told Moneycontrol that L&amp;amp;T's plan to derisk its holdings in Hyderabad Metro is likely to be a 2-3 year process as the metro project is still recovering from the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and will take a while before becoming an attractive asset that will fetch higher valuation.  L&amp;amp;T had last year refinanced around Rs 8,000 crore - Rs 9,000 crore of construction loans.  The company had refinanced the debt undertaken for the development of Hyderabad Metro leading to a favorable interest rate outgo and is planning for monetization of the real estate space of the metro network and seeking government grants to be able to lower the debt burden, which stood at about Rs 13,000 crore as of September 30, 2022.  L&amp;amp;T is also working to onboard a co-investor for Hyderabad Metro. It currently holds a 90 percent stake in the metro project with the remaining held by the Telangana Government.

L&amp;amp;T reported a 19 percent rise in consolidated revenue for Q2FY24 to Rs 51,024 crore, compared to Rs 42,763 crore clocked in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.  Higher-than-expected sales growth was driven by execution tailwinds in the infrastructure projects segment and sustained growth momentum in the IT and ITeS portfolio.  There was an expectation that the conglomerate would increase its revenue and order inflow guidance upwards for the rest of the fiscal year.  “Order inflow has been robust this year and we expect the management to increase its revenue and order inflow guidance upwards for the rest of fiscal year,” said analysts at Centrum Broking.  Analysts see a strong tender pipeline from domestic and overseas markets. L&amp;amp;T announced total orders in the range of Rs 24,500-44,500 crore during the quarter.  L&amp;amp;T won orders worth Rs 89,153 crore at the group level during Q2, logging a 72 percent growth over the corresponding quarter of the previous year when it had won orders worth Rs 51,914 crore.  During the reporting quarter, orders were received across multiple segments, including public spaces, nuclear power, and the irrigation, ferrous metal, health, renewables and refinery sectors, the company said in a press release.  International orders at Rs 59,687 crore during the quarter comprised 67 percent of the total order inflow. Last year, L&amp;amp;T had international orders worth Rs 17,341 crore which accounted for 33 percent of its total order inflow  The group’s consolidated order book was at Rs 450,734 crore as of the end of September, with international orders having a share of 35 percent. Last year, L&amp;amp;T had ended the same period with a group consolidated order book of Rs 372,381 crore.  The order book of Rs 4,12,648 crore represents a growth of 13.5 percent over Rs 3,63,448 crore as on June 30, 2022.  Its operating margin for the second quarter of FY2023-24 came in at 11 percent, compared to 11.4 percent in the year-ago quarter and 10.2 percent in the June quarter.  Analysts had expected L&amp;amp;T's operating margin to come in at 10.5 percent in the September quarter.  &amp;nbsp;  Infrastructure Projects Segment  Segment-wise, L&amp;amp;T’s infrastructure projects segment secured order inflows of Rs 27,990 crore, during the quarter that ended September 30, 2023, which was 11.7 percent higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year.  The segment order book stood at Rs 304,497 crore as on September 30, 2023, with the share of international orders at 23 percent.  Revenues from the segment rose 27 percent on year to Rs 24,976.8 crore while profit from the segment fell 2.9 percent on year to Rs 1035.6 crore.  The fall in profit was mainly on account of a fall in operating profit margin from the segment which fell to 5.4 percent in Q2FY24 from 6.6 percent in the same period a year ago.  L&amp;amp;T's infrastructure projects segment had seen a sequential fall in operating margins for the six quarters as the company won infrastructure projects at very aggressive prices after the post-COVID-19, post-Russia-Ukraine (conflict) period in 2022-23.  The company's chief financial officer R Shankar Raman Raman said that L&amp;amp;T expects its operating margin to start improving from October - December as orders won at aggressive prices in 2022-23 will complete execution and new orders start being carried out.  At the end of June, around 35-40 percent of L&amp;amp;T's then order book of Rs 3,01,159 crore from the infrastructure projects segment was made up of orders that were won at aggressive prices.  &amp;nbsp;  Energy Projects Segment  L&amp;amp;T secured order inflows of Rs 40,141 crore in this segment, during the quarter that ended September 30, 2023, which was nearly four times higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year when the company had won orders worth Rs 8,441 crore.  Energy Projects' Segment order book crossed Rs 100,000 crore for the first time ever, taking the segment order book to Rs 106,802 crore as on September 30, 2023, with the international order book constituting 79 percent.  Revenues from the segment rose 21.5 percent on year to Rs 6,794.25 crore while profit from the segment rose 40.2 percent on year to Rs 587.7 crore.  &amp;nbsp;  Hi-Tech Manufacturing Segment  L&amp;amp;T secured order inflows of Rs 3,395 crore in this segment, during the quarter that ended September 30, 2023, which was 35.5 percent higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year.  Hi-Tech Manufacturing Segment order book stood at Rs 25,958 crore as of September 30, 2023, with the international order book constituting 10 percent.  Raman said that order inflow in the company's Hi-Tech Manufacturing segment has been slow in the first half of FY24 due to the delays in the government awarding defense contracts.  &quot;Going forward we expect the government to aggressively come out with defense orders which will help order inflow of our Hi-Tech Manufacturing segment,&quot; Raman said.  Revenues from the segment rose 28.5 percent on year to Rs 2,041.14 crore while profit from the segment rose 5.5 percent on year to Rs 233.17 crore.  &amp;nbsp;  IT &amp;amp; Technology Services Segment  L&amp;amp;T's revenues from this segment rose to Rs 11,182 crore in this segment, during the quarter that ended September 30, 2023, which was 10.2 percent higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year.  International billing contributed 92 percent of the total customer revenues of the segment.  Profit from the segment fell 0.2 percent on the year to Rs 1901.24 crore. The EBITDA margin for the segment was at 20.2 percent for the quarter as compared to 21.4 percent in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.  The segment margin was impacted mainly due to higher employee cost though improved operational efficiencies partially negated the impact.  &amp;nbsp;  OUTLOOK  Going forward, L&amp;amp;T expects growth momentum in the Indian market to continue on the back of sustained buoyancy in services, consumer and business optimism, higher government spending, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, upcoming festive season demand and supply chain normalization.  L&amp;amp;T added that India continues to witness resilience on the back of strong domestic demand in contrast to global trends.  &quot;Investment activity is benefiting from continuing public sector capex with growth being witnessed in steel consumption, cement production as well as in imports and production of capital goods. Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector is also trending up, which augurs well for country-level capital formation,&quot; the company said.  Despite the recent conflict in the Middle East, L&amp;amp;T said it remains optimistic about fresh project awards in Oil and gas, industrialization, and energy transition projects from West Asian countries.  &quot;The war in the Middle East is unfortunate but most of our orders are in Saudi Arabia, which has so far steered away from any involvement in the war. It is unlikely that Israel-Hamas have any adverse impact but we will continue to watch it,&quot; the company's chief financial officer R Shankar Raman said while speaking in the post-earnings media conference call on October 31.

The stock rose 0.85 percent to Rs 2,099 on the NSE","The market was caught in a bear trap on September 28 after a spike in oil prices raised inflation worries. The benchmark indices fell nearly 1 percent on the monthly F&amp;amp;O expiry day, hence the bearish sentiment might take the Nifty50 towards 19,200 if it decisively breaks the 19,500 mark in the coming session, while the 19,600-19,700 may act as a near-term resistance area for the index, experts said.  The Nifty50 dropped 193 points to 19,523 and formed a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily charts, the bearish reversal pattern, while the BSE Sensex tanked 610 points to 65,508.  Among sectors, the Bank Nifty declined 287 points to 44,301, while the Nifty IT index slipped 715 points to 31,880 and formed a long, bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, breaking the 21-day EMA (exponential moving average placed at 32,337).

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Oil India  The stock has given a breakout of its Ascending Triangle chart pattern with a strong bullish candlestick. Additionally, on the daily charts, it has formed a higher bottom formation, hence the structure of the stock indicates the beginning of a fresh up trend from the current levels.  Unless it is trading below Rs 280, positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 315.    Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro  After the strong upward rally, the stock went into the consolidation mode on the daily scale. The recent breakout in the stock is representing a bullish continuation pattern, which is signifying a new leg of up move from the current levels.  For positional traders, Rs 2,920 would be the trend decider level. Trading above the same uptrend formation will continue till Rs 3,240. However, if it closes below Rs 2,920, traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions.  Data Patterns India  After sharp decline from the higher levels, the counter is in the accumulation zone where it is trading in a rectangle formation. Additionally, it is currently into an oversold territory and available near to its demand area.  The texture of the chart formation and technical indicator RSI (relative strength index) is indicating the reversal formation, which could lead to a new leg of the uptrend from its demand zone.

The professor used to taunt me in the class; he would say that there is one man who got a good percentage in SSC but that doesn't mean he will do well in college. He would say that and look at me.  But the day I walked out of the gate, I told myself that student life is over and now I must work on corporate life. I changed from a man who hardly attended classes to a person who never took a leave for 21 years and worked 15 hours a day from day one. I married early; my wife would be alone at home. Many times I would miss the last bus at 12 midnight. I slept on my office table.  Then Mr Baker, who recruited me, gave me a scooter after two years. He fought hard to get me a car early. All this happened because I made myself valuable to the company in whatever I do. I loved what I was doing; I wanted to build a platform which will help the country in nation building.  Just as you reinvented yourself, L&amp;amp;T has changed over the years. From a construction company to becoming a proxy for India’s infrastructure story, to its foray into information technology (IT) and new areas such as green energy and a big digital play. What drove you to reinvent L&amp;amp;T as an organisation into the conglomerate that it is today?  The infrastructure we did earlier was very elementary; now, we have the most complex infrastructure projects like building the statue of Sardar Patel, coastal road, a bridge over Brahmaputra, and high-speed projects. Earlier we would execute Rs 5 crore projects. Today, we don't do anything less than Rs 1,000 crore and our biggest project is going to be worth around Rs 25,000 crore.  L&amp;amp;T has transformed, we don’t even do road projects that we have done in the past because many others can do it. What people don't realise is that a whole industry has come up around L&amp;amp;T. Many infrastructure CEOs are from L&amp;amp;T; we have helped build the industry.  We have gone from working at a general workshop and making dairy tanks to becoming the number one heavy engineering complex at Hazira. Today, we make nuclear reactors and generators, aerospace equipment, and defence equipment. We have 60 processes where we are qualified; 40 percent of the production is exported. L&amp;amp;T is trusted outside and inside India.  L&amp;amp;T has a diversified business base. For the next big transformation, what would be the key targets that you would expect L&amp;amp;T and the new leadership to pursue?  I had a principle that I will not start anything unless it will give me $1 billion, at Rs 50 a dollar rate then. Secondly, the day I took over, I decided that I will get rid of non-core and small businesses. Either I will sell these businesses, or if they are in joint ventures (JVs), then we would either buy or sell the partner’s stake. We closed around 17 businesses and grew several businesses into several millions. I brought focus. Can you imagine we were also making shoes? We were about to enter manufacturing of bread on a mass scale. Fortunately, it stopped. We used to do a lot of things which were not connected. Those days, anybody could come up with an idea, and if they thought it had good prospects, they would convince the management and the company would get into the business. I had to clean it up.  Now, L&amp;amp;T has the manufacturing complex that is required. For the next 20 years, the land requirement, which we may have, is already in place. All the businesses have their manufacturing plan with an expansion for 20 years. There's a lot that can be done from the existing L&amp;amp;T verticals, they can be modified according to what’s needed in the world. There will be a lot of competition, like in green energy, and we must see how we handle it.  What you see as L&amp;amp;T today, almost 92 percent of it has been done during my time by our teams. What I inherited was 8 percent. We did not inherit tons of people, we created them.  What would be the key driver in the next phase of L&amp;amp;T?  In every vertical, we need to go to the next level and keep moving up the value chain. Take IT for instance, we talked about cloud 3-4 years ago as the next big thing. Then we talked about innovation and digital, we are now talking about the huge potential in AI (artificial intelligence). In the next five years, something else will happen…I can't even think of what that will be. Ideally, L&amp;amp;T would have good talent, leadership, and entrepreneurial thinking. When the opportunities come, we must know which one to pick. We should never do anything that will be less than $1 billion, even if it looks small now. Scale and speed will be important. You must create a size which is economically viable and make sure that you are ahead of the competition.  The new businesses that L&amp;amp;T is looking at, whether it is new energy, green or digital space, have competition at an international level. For example, L&amp;amp;T has a tie-up with Indian Oil Corporation and ReNew for green hydrogen but this is also something that countries across the world are chasing. How is L&amp;amp;T preparing and what more can the government do to support the industry?  For certain segments of green power, the government has to help industry. We are not getting into the production of power; we will get into building a power plant or building green power. If you talk about international competition, where have we not had international competition? IT is 95 percent international and we started from zero. Look at infrastructure, our hydrocarbon business is at least Rs 50,000 crore over the year which is outside India. Last four years in a row, we have been rated as the number one company in Asia, other than China. We have to have talent, which is so good and so devoted that they can transform the company in terms of the applied technology or creation of new technology. We need to have the right leadership.  Years ago, you had shared that one of the reasons why L&amp;amp;T entered IT services was also to retain talent because a lot of young talent was moving away from traditional core sectors; that bet seemed to have paid off well for you in the long term. The environment is changing yet again, from the gig economy to young people aspiring to be in professions like content creation. Will this be a challenge for a company like L&amp;amp;T to get the right kind of people?  That’s the biggest challenge for the road economy; everyone wants to go into research and make a tremendous amount of money. They know that if they work for somebody else, they will make, at best, a few crores and anything less than 10 crore is not worth going for. They're after startups; that is how India has become one of the centres in the world for many startups. There are new technologies in IT, like AI, digital automation, clouds and so on, they all want to go there. Then a lot of young people feel that banking is a good business. There is tremendous scope for building highways, buildings, complex infrastructure, hydropower stations or a tunnel in the Himalayas. But who will go for these? Even parents don’t want their son to go.  In this situation, how will this industry grow? It is needed for growth and nation building but it is a tough job. L&amp;amp;T depends on — training, training, and training. We have built our own institutions for management, projects, and manufacturing. We create our own people from mid-tier engineering colleges and not high flying engineers who will go to other industries. I was not an IIT graduate, because my father went to a village but destiny brought me to L&amp;amp;T. I believe the best students of second-level colleges are better than the bottom quadrant of the first-level colleges. So, we take them and train them well.  We have managed it well enough that the whole industry has sourced professionals from us, and they are becoming our competitors but that's a way of life.  In these 60 years at L&amp;amp;T, you spent more than half in leadership roles. What has been the most difficult phase for you as the leader of L&amp;amp;T?  I have gone through so many challenges; I can't even spend time to describe it. But the most difficult challenge was when we had a very small market cap, and we were susceptible to being taken over. For 17 years, the sword was hanging above our heads. When I became a CEO, I had to face that situation in 2003 when one industrial house wanted to take us over and they nearly took us over. That is a well recorded case study now. We saved L&amp;amp;T and formed an employees' trust like the Tata Trust. This employees’ trust is the biggest shareholder, and its value has grown to Rs 52,000 crore from nothing. We have ring-fenced L&amp;amp;T to the extent possible. That had been the most challenging time, day after day there were challenges which lasted for nearly 22 months.  That was the time I had to run to Delhi almost every fortnight. It also did good to me in a way that I could meet all the top political leaders. From being someone who has come from a village, who doesn't even know who was the secretary to ministers, I was suddenly lifted from here and taken to meet the Prime Minister (Atal Bihari Vajpayee), Deputy Prime Minister Advani ji (Lal Krishna Advani), and other leaders like the NDA Chairman, George Fernandes, Jaswant Singh, the finance minister, etc. It had been a very challenging time but I took everything as a hobby; I didn't carry any tension. I faced a tremendous number of challenges but at night I slept well even if it was for a few hours.  First time in L&amp;amp;T’s history, I launched a strategic plan in 2000, and from the strategic plans, we could emerge as the company we have come to be known as.  Also read : Naik to pass on the baton to Subrahmanyan but will still be involved with L&amp;amp;T  L&amp;amp;T’s focus has been infrastructure, which depends on government policies and government spending. You have interacted with different prime ministers over the years and different chief ministers. In fact, you worked closely with PM Narendra Modi when he was chief minister of Gujarat. How do you strike a balance with the political leadership in putting across the demands of the industry and managing within the framework put forth by the government?  We were building what India wants; I made sure everybody knew. People like you in the media also helped us do that by writing articles on what L&amp;amp;T stands for.  I was elated when Manmohan Singhji (former Prime Minister) referred to L&amp;amp;T as the national company. When Mr Modi came to power, he would call us a national company too. Manmohan Singhji used to say there are three types of companies — government companies, private companies, and only one national company L&amp;amp;T. Many ministers who had strategic roles said the same thing; I am satisfied by how we have positioned L&amp;amp;T. We are respected for the brand, and our honesty and we don’t get involved in anything relating to politics.  You were always open with your views about the industry and what needed to be done. In fact, many times you took a stand not just for L&amp;amp;T but also for the infrastructure and power sectors. You were among the first to consistently flag concerns about Chinese imports. Did that pose a challenge with reference to the political parties in power, or were they receptive to the ideas?  I have struggled my whole life with respect to government policies; there was always something or the other. There were forces which were stronger than us and they were able to get it done as a policy and we couldn’t, in some cases, change it. There have always been challenges, but I think as time has passed, and particularly in the current Prime Minister’s time, when he started talking about Atmanirbhar Bharat. What I was talking about alone, is now the voice of men. There are many corrections made in the policies and therefore the suffering has been less to an extent.  You have been raising issues around India’s dependence on Chinese imports for a very long time. The government acknowledges it is a matter of national security and has a clear stand on it. Do you think the industry has responded by investing to ensure we are self-sufficient and not dependent on Chinese imports?  When Mr. Nixon was president (of the US), and Henry Kissinger was in his cabinet, the latter made more than 20 visits to China to help it become a manufacturing base. The US would talk on technology and research and slowly, they went out of manufacturing in many cases and became dependent on China. China made very good use of this opportunity. Being autocratic, they could implement many things which in India we can’t as a democratic country. They built such a base that there are many things that only they do. Now, given the geopolitical tension in the world, everyone is talking about ‘China plus one’. That means they want one more major base. It’s a great opportunity for India if we straighten our policies and have a political environment that is conducive to really getting things done in a very straightforward and peaceful manner.  You believe that India has an opportunity arising out of ‘China plus one’ global strategy. Manufacturing in India has still not picked up significantly. You mentioned that the environment needs to be conducive; what advice would you give to the government to help spur investment in manufacturing?  It is not that manufacturing has not picked up. We are becoming the second-largest auto gear manufacturer, that's manufacturing. Earlier Ambassador and Fiat had one model that was manufactured in 1000s, now, we are manufacturing in millions. Even in steel, we are today self-sufficient. In consumer goods, we are self-reliant, we are not importing. In electronics, whether it is TVs or appliances, we make them in India. We are relying on other countries for aeronautical manufacturing but even there some beginning has been made with Hindustan Aeronautics.  I think India has not spent 50 years very wisely, we should have spent a lot of time on building manufacturing like China and becoming self-sufficient in defence. We are importing from the US, France, and Russia. A think-tank should decide when that will stop and when will India make a decision in lakhs of crores. While some indigenisation has taken place, a lot more must happen. The government has invested heavily in Hindustan Aeronautics. But the question is, why in the past 50 years, Hindustan Aeronautics has not been able to do what China did in less than that — manufacture planes, including commercial planes?  Aeronautics is very complex and highly competitive manufacturing. But why can't we compete on manufacturing of, say, smartphones with China? China manufactures 70 percent of smartphones. India has just started. But India still depends on China for components. We must have a strong ancillary base to support the final product.  Given this background, what makes you bullish on India?  I am bullish because things are happening. I am a restless man, I believe things should happen faster. There is a need for speed and scale.  You are stepping down as the Chairman of L&amp;amp;T but you will continue as the head of the company’s employees’ trust. What role would you play in L&amp;amp;T going ahead?  I am a well-wisher of L&amp;amp;T. I am highly satisfied with the way L&amp;amp;T has come up to this point. I will continue to be the chairman of the trust which is the biggest shareholder in the company. The trust is running many schemes to help retired L&amp;amp;T people as well as the current L&amp;amp;T people beyond what the company can do out of its own medical scheme. It is promoting sports and so on. A lot of creative work needs to be done at the trust, which I am doing. There is so much to do in the world; I am very busy with my charity and philanthropy, and I will do more. I will work on the larger cause of society and the employees’ well-being, I am working on a larger canvas. I am always a well-wisher of L&amp;amp;T. I keep talking to them. I will continue to talk to our chairman Mr S N Subrahmanyan. Being the Chairman of the trust, I am sure whoever is there will always be happy to talk to me.  Over the years you have added bits and pieces to L&amp;amp;T which have grown into big businesses making L&amp;amp;T the conglomerate that it is today. Did you ever think of starting your own venture?  L&amp;amp;T has been a tremendous support. When I decided to start an IT business, which was totally different from L&amp;amp;T’s core business, at the back of my mind I knew I had L&amp;amp;T’s backing. If I had to start it on my own, I would have to create a small startup. I am not mentally geared for starting anything small; anything less than a billion is not on my mind. That is how L&amp;amp;T from being a very small company, is now at $23 billion at Rs 82 a dollar.  Was there no hunger for ownership?  Not until now. And now, we have created many hospitals and schools.  The startup environment is thriving in India, many youngsters are working to build something on their own. What advice would you give to young people who want to make it big in business?  The advanced technologies and whatever they are trying to do in the modern world, I don't understand many of them. I am being honest that I am not competent enough to give them advice in many sectors. But in general, I want to advise them not to rush into anything just because you want to be another billionaire. Everyone doesn't become a billionaire; eight out of 10 may not succeed. They don’t succeed because they rush without proper study on what they are starting and how they can stand up to others who are anyway doing the same thing in South America, China, Japan, or the US.  You mentioned that you managed to sleep well despite challenges like hostile takeover bids. How did you manage that as a leader?  The most challenging times were 2003 and 2004. But did that make me sleepless at night? Maybe one or two nights would go sleepless but otherwise, I slept well. Why did I sleep well? Because I looked at every challenge as a hobby and I enjoyed it. If I have no challenges, I start wondering what to do. I lived with challenges. Without challenges, I am a little unhappy and I get more tense.  You have been awarded the Padma Vibhushan by the government, a very rare honour in business. You have received many awards and accolades. What kind of response have you got from your peers outside L&amp;amp;T? You stood for the industry many times; do you feel they respected you for that?  By and large, the entire industry has respect for me. That's what I feel from how they react when I go to them. You can ask my peer about it.  How is your family preparing for you after you step down as Chairman of L&amp;amp;T? It will be very difficult to take L&amp;amp;T away from you and for you to not go to the office every day…  I am here every day. (The interview is taking place at Naik’s home office in Mumbai’s Bandra suburb). Six hours a day from 12 noon to 6. There is not a day when I am not at work. If nothing else, I do my charity work. I plan all my charity, hold meetings — it is an institute by itself.  I am still the Consul General of Denmark until 2025. I have told the ambassador I can't continue beyond 25. I am still the chairman of both IT companies for one year. I am still the advisor of L&amp;amp;T up to 2025. I have decided that by 2025, I will give up everything and only run the trust and my two trust social work ventures.  You have often said that your wife never complained about not getting time because…  I would say without that I would not have been able to do what I did. As I told you, I slept on the table in my office many times. How many wives are going to tolerate that these days?  Will she get more time from you now?  Yes, and that is what sometimes I worry about! (Laughs)  Any last thoughts on what you want to see from L&amp;amp;T next?  It’s a great company, and I want to see it become greater. And I am hopeful of L&amp;amp;T’s future because it has a great leader; it will happen.  Are you planning a holiday to celebrate your retirement?  No, I have a wound which has not settled down for a year and it pains me when I walk.  Perhaps it’s time to give it a little rest?  Yes, I am enjoying rest also. Anything you do, you must enjoy it. I am happy.  My son has come back to India after 29 years, he did not take a US passport all this while. He has come back, and it gives me relief because he goes every week to our village for all the hospital related work. His wife goes to the Mumbai hospital and my sister’s daughter helps a lot in our philanthropic work. Like L&amp;amp;T, I have also set up an organisation here. All of them enjoy the work given to them.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-interview-india-needs-to-focus-on-speed-and-scale-hopeful-of-lts-future-chairman-am-naik-11127891.html

He pointed out that while the scale of manufacturing has increased in India in the consumer goods, automobile, steel and electronic appliances sectors in the last few decades, the government should come up with long-term strategies to increase manufacturing scale for all sectors.

We need to have the right leadership,&quot; Naik said.  He pointed out that going forward, the government needs to help the industry expand in the green energy segment.  Naik throughout his tenure has been a champion of increasing manufacturing capacity in India to compete with global players.  In July 2022, a grouping of 18 economies, including India, the US and the European Union, unveiled a roadmap for establishing collective supply chains that would be resilient in the long term.

The brokerage said L&amp;amp;T and Maruti were also included in the global emerging markets (GEM) focus list.  The brokerage said it is bullish on India's financial sector and is increasing its 'overweight' position on industrials while reducing its 'overweight' stance on IT.  The brokerage says Maruti Suzuki is poised to benefit from rising per-capita income in India, alongside market share growth and an improved product mix. The company's strong track record of successful new models and expanded price ranges, especially focusing on SUVs, is expected to drive further market share expansion. It foresees margin expansion to approximately 9 percent by F2025, driven by leverage gains, a new SUV-focused model cycle, and the gradual pass-through of commodity headwinds.  Maruti's alliance with Suzuki-Toyota positions it favourably for the future of the automotive industry (Autos 2.0). Despite fair valuations, there is potential for the company's multiple to expand, considering the anticipated improvement in auto volumes, margins, and market share.  Also Read: India at the start of 'long wave boom', China's may be ending soon: Morgan Stanley  India's per capita GDP stands at only $2500, significantly lower than China's $12,700. However, despite the lower income level, India exhibits positive demographic trends, which positions the country to potentially embark on a prolonged wave of economic growth. This comes at a time when China may be experiencing a slowdown, Morgan said in its note.  A notable contrast between the two countries is the level of household debt relative to GDP. In India, household debt/GDP is only 19 percent, while in China, it is much higher at 48 percent. Moreover, life insurance penetration in India is comparatively low, with only 2 percent of Indian households having life insurance coverage.  Morgan expects Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro to be a leading beneficiary of the Indian and broader EM capex cycle. The brokerage says L&amp;amp;T enjoys domestic macro tailwinds and strong infrastructure prospects in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.  L&amp;amp;T stands out with its economies of scale, impressive order inflow growth, diversified order book, improved execution, and lower margin volatility. Despite its core valuations trading near the long-term average, it remains an attractive choice compared to its EPC peers, which are trading at a 20 percent premium to long-term averages.  Morgan Stanley foresees a profit cycle that is halfway through its course, as profit share in GDP has increased from 2 percent in 2020 to approximately 4 percent and is expected to reach 8 percent in the next four to five years. This indicates a 10 percent nominal GDP and about 20 percent compound growth in headline earnings.  The forecast is supported by the initiation of a new private capex cycle, which complements the ongoing government capex cycle. These factors underscore the promising outlook for economic growth and earnings expansion in the foreseeable future.  Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about India due to its favourable fundamentals and reduced valuation premiums compared to other Emerging Markets (EM). The country is now designated as the core 'overweight' market within the Asia Pacific ex-Japan and EM category. The market is willing to pay a premium for India's growth opportunities, with the 12-month P/E and trailing P/B ratios standing above historical averages.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/morgan-adds-maruti-suzuki-lt-to-its-focus-list-for-asia-pacific-stocks-11088141.html
lt,2023-07-28T06:16:00+05:30,Vidnyan Sawant," Hot Stocks | Escorts Kubota, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Godrej Properties can return up to 14% in short term, here's...","The overall trend of the Nifty index looks positive till it sustains above 19,562 levels and potential upside would be 19,991 followed by the 20,200 mark.","By Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - technical research at GEPL Capital  On the monthly charts, the Nifty is sustaining above the breakout of Cup &amp;amp; Handle pattern at life high levels indicating strong positive undertone of the index. On the weekly charts, the stock has been consistently forming Higher Top Higher Bottom pattern since April 2023. However, in the previous week, the Nifty formed long upper wick candle indicating profit booking has happened at higher levels.  We witnessed the lower top lower bottom formation in the Nifty Index on the daily charts for the last few days indicating a short term corrective sign.  The momentum indicator RSI is declining from over bought level on the daily charts, indicating a loosing positive momentum of the Index for the short term. The index has a strong support at 19,562 (weekly low) followed by 19,230 (key support). While on the higher side, the mark of 19,991 (life high) followed by 20,200 (key resistance) are crucial levels to watch out for.  The overall trend of the Nifty index looks positive till it sustains above 19,562 levels and potential upside would be 19,991 followed by 20,200 mark, however if it breaches 19,562 level on the downside then it will correct till 19,230 mark for the short to medium term.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,660 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 | Target: Rs 2,900 | Return: 9 percent  The correction in the stock of L&amp;amp;T took place gracefully as the stock post December 2022 did not get into the formation of Lower Highs and Lower Lows despite the overall market correction. This illustrates the positive undertone of the prices.  Currently, the stock appears to be emerging from a consolidation phase, signaling a continuation of the uptrend. The breakout from this consolidation was accompanied by a Gap and substantial trading volumes, providing further confirmation of the breakout.  Moreover, the prices have consistently found support at the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA), which has acted as a reliable variable support level. This reinforces the notion of an upward trend beginning to take shape.  The momentum oscillator, MACD (moving average convergence divergence), has demonstrated a favourable crossover above the zero line, reflecting the likelihood of prices trending upward from their current levels.  Going forward, we can expect the stock prices to move higher till the level of Rs 2,900 where the stop-loss must be Rs 2,550 on the Daily Closing basis.    Escorts Kubota: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,449.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,320 | Target: Rs 2,650 | Return: 8 percent  The stock is currently performing at an unprecedented level, with a clear upward trajectory marked by consistent increases in both highs and lows within the established rising channel.  Recently, a breakout from a Rounding Bottom pattern was noticed in the stock. This is an encouraging signal that suggests the continuation of the upward trend.  When it comes to support levels, the stock prices have been reliably cushioned by the 12 &amp;amp; 26-day exponential moving averages (EMA), reinforcing the upward trend during each phase of growth.  As for the momentum of the stock, the MACD indicator remains in a strong position well above the baseline, demonstrating the stock's sustained positive momentum.  Looking forward, we anticipate that the stock prices will continue to climb until they reach the level of Rs 2,650. At this point, a stop-loss should be implemented at Rs 2,320 on a closing basis.    Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,707 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,610 | Target: Rs 1,950 | Return: 14 percent  The stock formed CIP (change in polarity) formation near Rs 1,000 levels in March 2023 and bounced back with the formation of Higher Top Higher Bottom on the monthly charts indicating strong positive undertone for the long term trend.  On the weekly charts, the stock has given a Cup &amp;amp; Handle pattern breakout with volume confirmation which confirms the bullish structure of the stock. On the daily charts, the stock has been consistently moving upward with the support of 13-day EMA and sustaining at 52-week high level.  Also the stock is sustaining above its important moving averages like 50, 100 &amp;amp; 200-day SMA (simple moving average) which shows the strong bullish sentiments of the stock.  The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) on the weekly as well as on the daily timeframe is rising and sustaining above 65 levels reflecting presence of positive momentum.  We expect the prices to move higher till Rs 1,950 level where the stop-loss must be Rs 1,610 strictly on the closing basis.

lt,2023-07-26T19:52:00+05:30,Rachita Prasad,"MC Interview | Order win rate 20 percent so far in FY24, infra margins will improve: L&amp;T CFO  ",CFO says Middle East growth is looking at more broad-based translating into more opportunities for L&amp;T  ,"Engineering major Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro’s (L&amp;amp;T) order win rate has been 20 percent so far in fiscal 2023-24 but the company is closely watching its pipeline for any possible slowing in the domestic ordering process due to upcoming state and Union elections, chief financial officer R Shankar Raman told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview.  L&amp;amp;T reported strong growth in revenue, order inflow and profit after tax growth in Q1FY24. But its biggest business, infrastructure projects, witnessed a contraction in operating margins, weighed by some legacy orders that carried low input costs prevailing at the time. Raman said that the impact of these orders may last till the December quarter, after which the order mix should support margin growth.  In a freewheeling interview, the CFO shared the outlook on the different businesses of the company, prospects of big-ticket orders in West Asia, and L&amp;amp;T’s farewell gift to chairman AM Naik, who steps down in September. Edited excerpts:  L&amp;amp;T has announced that it will buy back as much as Rs 10,000 crore worth of shares at a maximum price of Rs 3,000 apiece. The last time you attempted it, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had rejected it because of debt concerns as the consolidated number included debt on L&amp;amp;T Finance’s books. How is it different this time?   Since the last time, we have obtained a lot of regulatory clarifications. Last time, the Companies Act was talking about the entity which is going to do the buyback, whereas SEBI looked at it as a group. And financial services is part and parcel of our group and that is a debt-heavy business. So the debt of financial services was aggregated at SEBI's headquarters, whereas the Companies Act excluded them. So there was a bit of confusion on what defines the debt-equity post-buyback. But since then, we've worked with SEBI and SEBI had subsequently issued clarifications and guidelines, which now make it very clear. And another big change is while making all these changes, SEBI also said that so long as the regulations are met, and they are certified by an appropriate agency, SEBI just needs to be kept informed. There is no approval that is required from SEBI. So to that extent, the process has become simpler and more predictable.  What’s the rationale behind the share buyback and the timing?  It has got nothing to do with a timeline or share price, let me clarify. I think part of the Lakshya FY26 plan (L&amp;amp;T’s latest and ongoing five-year strategic plan) and the strategic plan that we drew between FY21 and FY26 had ROE (return on equity) improvement as a key target. The  ROE improves because of two things. One is the businesses being run more profitably than in the past. And secondly, the capital intensity in the balance sheet reduces. So a combination of return-accretive business and divestment of capital-heavy items in the balance sheet could actually lead to this ROE improvement. We have, over the last two years, been working on both. We are trying to improve the profitability of the businesses. At the same time, we are also trying to get out of businesses that are capital heavy and, hence, not necessarily return-accretive in the short to medium term. Added to this is also the focus on cash flow management within the organisation. Today, I think every project site and every project director is conscious of the fact that the work done has to be reimbursed by the client in a quick time. So the cash-to-cash cycle has received a lot of focus. That has brought down the working capital intensity in the company's operations from over 25-26 percent of revenue. Today we are running at about 16-17 percent of revenue.  The capital unlocked in this process and the non-allocation of further capital to asset-heavy operations have resulted in a cash surplus. Our job as a public limited company is to work for shareholders' value creation, and shareholder value creation happens both through capital appreciation of the stock price as well as the yield of holding that investment going up. One way the yield can go up is through dividends, which we have kept up. The dividend payout ratios are today upwards of 40 percent. They used to be 20-25 percent a few years ago. And secondly, I think once we assess the requirements of cash for all our requirements for the next few years if the cash available is more than what we require, we think it is appropriate to return that cash to the shareholders.  We're extremely confident that if the company requires capital, it should be able to go to the market and raise it as and when required. But in any case, that doesn't seem to be the course for the next few years. That being the case, we thought that it is as good a time as any to do this. Also, I think it is an important transition that's happening in the company. Our chairman, Mr Naik, after such a long and glorious innings, is stepping down. His term comes to an end on September 30. And he has always been a well-wisher of shareholders in terms of his thought process and actions. So we thought it'll be also fitting that when he steps down, the shareholders have something to rejoice about, both in terms of the special dividend that we're giving at Rs 6 per share, as well as this buyback offer.  The infra projects business had a robust performance in Q1FY24 but margins declined due to legacy orders. Are there more such orders? What sectors are driving the growth and what’s the outlook on margin?  I think in terms of orders, the sector that has been most productive has been in the area of heavy civil infrastructure. It's mostly related to transportation, mobility-related infrastructure spending of the government, be it the high-speed rail, be it the dedicated freight corridor, be it the metro projects that cities are executing. So transportation has been a big area where both the allocation of funds by the government as well as the thrust that they have provided for making sure that the bids are, you know, fashioned and put out consistently, has been a big help. We've also seen water as a major area where we've been able to grow our infrastructure business. And I think India is water-stressed in many parts. We do have this uneven distribution of rainfall, which causes flooding and drought interchangeably.  So many state governments—and this is more of a state government project—many of the state governments have been trying to improve the irrigation facilities and drinking water facilities, and we have benefited from that thrust as well. Over the last five, seven years, I think the government has been working to make sure that all villages are lit. So there has been a considerable number of programmes that have been rolled out in terms of rural electrification. Much of that is coming to an end now. I think much of India is lit now. But we had the benefit of the role of those orders as well in our infrastructure pie.  Residential constructions and commercial construction have resumed. There was a quiet period after the pandemic. But now I think projects are coming up. Obviously, the markets have got far more selective. I think good projects sell and not-so-good projects do not make the cut.  We're fortunate that some of these are under development. Also, much conversation is happening around the development of public spaces. If you speak about railway station development, transit-oriented development, airport development, inter-land connectivity for ports—all of this has got to do with public infrastructure because I think we produce a lot of things but a lot of things do not reach the market because they rot on the way. The logistics management needs a lot of improvement. So all of this would mean investment in warehouse logistics.  We're also building infrastructure for both healthcare as well as sports. We are getting orders from the hospital sector. We are getting orders from the stadium sector. On a very broad-based basis, India has now come to realise that developing infrastructure all around is key for it to take advantage of the global market conditions.  But one thing is for certain, I think the keenness with which project sponsors are approaching the implementation of projects has multiplied several times if I compare over the last 10 years. And that holds us in good faith. And I guess it augurs well for our future as well. Talking about margins, I think the order book that we have is a mixture of orders procured during the difficult pandemic, post-pandemic, post-war time, and orders that we have won in more recent times. For the orders that we have won in most recent times, I have the advantage of looking back at the price levels that got inflated. So the pricing takes into account the inflationary conditions. But the orders that we booked around the pandemic time and just around the time when Russia went to war, were all booked when the input prices were 30-40 percent lower than what they are today.  It was important that we execute the project because unless we complete the project, there is not even a conversation opportunity with the customers to see some compensation for all the additional cost inflation that has crept in beyond their estimation and beyond our estimation. So the results that you see over the last two quarters and in the current quarter, and maybe going forward in the next quarter or two, would reflect slowly the exhaustion of the projects that we have taken under these conditions. And as we get into the fourth quarter of the current year, we will begin to see the mix of recently acquired projects coming into our revenue and, hence, contributing to margins in a fashion better than what they are today. I'm confident about 2025 being much better margin-wise. And if we continue to win the orders the way we have been doing so far, I think we also hopefully will end the current year with a very healthy order book. And that sets in motion the pace of execution for the following year. So volume growth, as well as profitability growth, are what we are forecasting for 2024-25. But then we need to first complete our task for 2023-24.  At the beginning of the fiscal, L&amp;amp;T's management said that growth in revenue will be 12-15 percent and order intake will be 10-12 percent in FY24. Given that in the first quarter, which is typically not a strong one for the company, order inflow was up 57 percent and revenue up 34 percent, are you looking at exceeding the guidance?  We're also coming to terms with this volatility. You're right that the first quarter generally would not be a very large quarter for order intake. And the second quarter will not be a very large quarter for revenue because of monsoon conditions, etc. That's the historical trend. But what we witnessed in the first quarter is a lot of spillover of what was lined up for FY23. Given the nature of these orders being lumpy and large-sized, I think slippage between the quarters takes the percentages on a different trajectory. I do not want to draw a conclusion by saying that around 56 percent growth in order inflow in the first quarter means that I would be able to sit on the lead right through the next three quarters.  We also need to be conscious of the fact that some of the large state elections and Union elections we are heading into and, hence, we're not in a position today to predict the pace at which some of the ordering, etc., will be done. At the moment, we are targeting orders that we want to win during the current year. So the pipeline for the remaining three quarters looks healthy. Our win rate, also the fact that whether all of these projects will go through is something that we'll have to wait and watch for. We didn't want to move the goalpost of guidance within two months of having announced it. We are happy that we have got off to a good start for the year, but we just want to wait and watch for a while before we get some certainty in our mind that we will do better than what we have guided the market for. Looks encouraging, but I would get into specifics after I get some more time on my hand to assess.  In your last interview to Moneycontrol in May, you said the order pipeline is worth Rs 10 lakh crore. And L&amp;amp;T aims to maintain order win rate of 15-20 percent. How are we doing on that front?  The win rate has been around 20 percent. I think we have fortunately been able to maintain the competitiveness at that level. Insofar as the pipeline is concerned, when we did a check as a part of this closing of the first quarter, the projects that are lined up add up to about Rs 9.5-10 lakh crore, and I think Rs 6 lakh crore is essentially for the infrastructure segment. About Rs 3.5 lakh crore is from hydrocarbon. Hydrocarbon, compared to the last time over, has grown in the prospect pipeline largely because of the energy transition work that is happening all around the world, particularly the energy transition work that is happening in the Middle Eastern market. As we speak, we have close to $5 billion worth of orders that we have won in the Middle East for solar energy and green energy initiatives. If that trend were to continue, we could see the pipeline of Rs 3.5 lakh crore that we are estimating coming into play. So with all the rest of the infrastructure area, the industrial capital expenditure, the construction mining sector—all of them put together, maybe Rs 1 lakh crore. So I do see the Rs 10 lakh crore assessment staying good if we have an uninterrupted nine months for the current year.  In the media call on July 25, you mentioned that the Middle East is now changing from being a hydrocarbon-centric economy to a more broad-based economy. Can you explain what you meant by that? What does this mean for L&amp;amp;T?  In the past, largely, our order wins used to be in the area of oil and gas, it used to be either offshore extraction or pipeline or onshore processing. It used to be almost a single-pony trick in a manner of speaking. But of late, the investments that the Middle East is doing has changed trajectory. I think they want to (a) develop a rail network, (b) they want to develop the Middle East as a tourist destination. So a lot of facilities including attracting, you know, large world-stage games like the FIFA World Cup that Qatar hosted so successfully. These initiatives are now changing the landscape of investments. Now that they are looking at more people visiting the Middle East, etc., they're investing also in rail infrastructure. The Middle East, as you know, is largely a road infrastructure-led, commercial real estate-led market. Now they're also building cities. Which means residential buildings and townships will develop.  Now that the entire world is talking about sustenance and green initiatives, the Middle East realises it is extracting and exporting lots of fossil fuel. To compensate, I think all the new builds that they're doing are being done on the back of solar. We do expect the Middle East also to invest in downstream industries like hydrogen and green ammonia and stuff like that. Hence, I find that the investment pattern that the Middle East is taking, particularly Saudi Arabia, is refreshingly different. Fortunately for us, it plays to our strength. All that we do well in India are the areas that they are now investing in. So we do hope that we will stay prequalified for all those opportunities. And these are typically very large opportunities compared to Indian opportunities. The size of projects is $1 billion, $2 billion, and $3 billion quite easily. We are also hedging our bets by trying to form partnerships, and work in a consortium to make sure that we do not have any excessive risk loaded onto our balance sheet in this quest of growing scale.  In the hi-tech business, your order inflows were impacted by deferrals in heavy engineering and defence. Would this business make up in the rest of the year? What are the laggards?  Large investments in India- both private and public sector- that were planned but deferred were the reason for the business slipping on orders as this division would have supplied to these projects. We do believe it is a deferment and not a complete abandonment of the project. Maybe in the subsequent quarters, what we missed out on in quarter one would come through. As far as defence is concerned, it's always delay-prone because of the layers of approvals that a particular project needs to take.  The fact that the government is keen on promoting private sector collaboration along with the existing public sector entities in defence production augmentation also has its own complexities, because from a mindset where everything for defence used to be catered to by the public sector to co-living with the private sector, who by structure are far more efficient, faster and hopefully cheaper/less expensive compared to public sector units, actually creates complexities in the decision-making process. While promoting the private sector, the government cannot be seen as demoting the public sector. So some of the orders that we were expecting in defence in quarter one were deferred. We do believe that we would get a boost in the rest of the year.  You have made substantial progress with your L&amp;amp;T Hyderabad Metro project and you have already chalked out a plan for the Nabha Power (in Patiala, Punjab) divestment. What would be the total divestment that you hope to do in FY24?  I think we will hopefully complete IDPL (Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd, a public-private partnership subsidiary). I think that all the road concessions that we are holding through L&amp;amp;T IDPL where we have signed a definitive agreement with Edelweiss Group, we need to complete. Various approvals are underway. It's a tedious process, because it's about 10-12 assets, and each asset has its own string of approvals. We are working at it, and that is something that we will complete this year. Hyderabad Metro, I think the effort this year would be to make the asset better and better. With every quarter passing, we are walking that extra mile to make sure it gets better. And it has been so that way. I think the status last December compared to last March compared to this June, things have moved both in terms of ridership as well as capital structure. I think we should continue to do that and close the year on stronger ridership and less debt. I think it might take a year or more thereafter before we can even put it on the table for a potential investor because the investor would like to invest when he sees a balanced capital structure, as well as proven ridership. And this being such a large project—a Rs 20,000 crore project—we might have to give ourselves a couple of years to get that done. I don't expect the divestment of Hyderabad Metro to happen this year.  As far as Nabha Power is concerned, the asset is performing very well. The Punjab government is dependent quite heavily on this asset, almost 90 percent PLF (plant load factor) is what we are running. So on a merit-based dispatch order, priority is given to the output that we generate at Nabha Power. Nabha Power has also turned profitable. It is contributing Rs 1,000 crore a quarter of revenue and Rs 100 crore a quarter of profits. But the fact is it is burning coal and, hence, is not necessarily a priority sector for investors to come in. We are still holding out hope that someday just the efficiency of the plant and the robustness of the PPA (power purchase agreement) will find some investor who's looking at some annuity yield for the business asset. But it is difficult to find a single asset owner because normally these investors would like to look at a portfolio of assets. They need to find more similar plants, which are equally efficient, and have equally robust PPAs before they pool them together and invest. So I think it's going to take some work. But at the moment it is not causing any financial stress to us. So we're not sort of blinking too early on that.  You talked about the opportunity in infrastructure in India. From where we stand right now, what are the top things that are making you bullish about the India story?  Well, I think the need to feed hungry mouths, the need to diversify growth, make it more inclusive, etc., seems to be a common theme among the political dispensation regardless of the party. I think people have come to realise and I think demonstratively it has been true that you create more employment, you improve your tax-to-GDP ratio. So the focus is on creating employment. And if you look at employment creation, it cannot be that half a dozen centres or a dozen centres in the country are the only hubs where employment opportunities exist. This has to be taken deeper into the country. If you want to take it deeper into the country, both people's mobility and goods mobility become important. As you get deeper into the country, infrastructure development to support these employment-generating opportunities to subsist in those areas needs to pick up. So it's actually one feeding off the other. The broader theme that the government and the bureaucracy seems to have bought into actually is the core of the investments that come in.  According to me, India is an underserviced market, even for infrastructure, much less for the consumer, but even for infrastructure. Global funds are more than happy to invest. I think what we need to do is have policies and rules and procedures that make investors feel safe and confident. We still today have work to do on the bureaucracy part of it. The approvals do take time. We have to find ways to make that efficient. The intent is there. I think everybody wants to get on with it and see the project's completion, etc. But just the fact that we are moving from one age of bureaucracy to another age of bureaucracy, and digital is helping in this process, is a time-consuming effort. And I think it also takes some generational mindsets. I'm hopeful over the next 10-20 years the set of bureaucrats who will come to administer all the infrastructure development programmes under the political leadership will possibly make it a more attractive place for investors to invest. Once you have the need, once you have the money coming in, and once you have the policy framework supporting it, then I think we need to do a lot of things around not to be bullish about.  You mentioned that among other factors behind the decision for the shares buyback, it is also a kind of a salute to AM Naik, who is stepping down from the company after almost six decades. How does the L&amp;amp;T team, especially the senior management, many of whom were personally mentored by him, plan to bid him goodbye?  The plan for his farewell is to have one more quarter of good performance because September 30 would be the quarter's end. Nothing makes him happier than a very strong set of outcomes. So I think that's one motivation immediately for the quarter. Insofar as life after Mr Naik is concerned, I think we have been nurtured and grown both company-wise and people-wise by him and his philosophies and leadership values. Those are going to stay with us. I hope that we will be able to continue the cause of the company and its shareholders' value creation targets in a manner where people don't refer to it as, you know, Mr Naik's term and post Mr Naik's term. We just want to make sure that we build on the huge body of good work that he has done. And to maintain and take it forward is going to take enormous effort and belief. And I think he's very much around to guide us and he is one of the most accessible persons. If there is some guidance that we would require, we will always depend on him, and we will have his blessings and good wishes.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/mc-interview-order-win-rate-20-percent-so-far-in-fy24-infra-margins-will-improve-lt-cfo-11036061.html

L&amp;amp;T has witnessed strong inflow and stellar execution, CLSA highlighted while keeping a ‘buy’ call on the infrastructure major’s stock with a target price of Rs 3,080.

lt,2023-07-25T20:58:42+05:30,Yaruqhullah Khan,"L&amp;T Q1 results: Operating margins from infra segment expected to rise from January-March quarter, says CFO",The engineering major's management expects operating margins to improve in the next few quarters but is cautious about slowing ordering activity going ahead due to Union Elections that will take place in 2024.,"Infrastructure giant Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro expects its operating margins from the infrastructure segment to rise from current levels in the last quarter of the current financial year 2023-24, the company's chief financial officer R Shankar Raman said.  On July 25, L&amp;amp;T reported its financial result for the first quarter of 2023-24 where it exceeded analysts' expectations on the top line and bottom line. However, the company missed its forecast for margin which declined year-on-year once again.  Speaking in a post-earning media conference call, Raman said L&amp;amp;T's operating margins from the infra segment are expected to improve after December as the company will by then begin execution of higher-margin infrastructure projects.  &quot;We had seen an aggressive pricing environment in the infrastructure segment in the post-COVID-19, post-Russia-Ukraine (conflict) period in 2022-23. During that period, L&amp;amp;T won infrastructure projects at very aggressive prices, which has impacted our margins,&quot; Raman said.  He added that currently around 35-40 percent of L&amp;amp;T's order book of Rs 3,01,159 crore from the infrastructure projects segment is made up of orders that were won at aggressive prices.  L&amp;amp;T's infrastructure projects segment has seen a sequential fall in operating margins for the last five quarters.  In the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the company reported a 140 basis point fall in its operating margin from the segment to 5.1 percent, when compared to 6.5 percent in the same period a year ago.  Raman said that the contraction of operating margin from the segment is likely to ease over the next few quarters as all older projects won at aggressive prices will be executed.  &quot;Orders L&amp;amp;T has won in the last quarter of 2022-23 and in 2023-24 so far have been at a better price which will help bounce back operating margins from December,&quot; Raman said.  Order Inflow  Despite the growth in operating margin expected after December 2023, Raman said that he expects L&amp;amp;T's order inflow to taper down in the second half of 2023-24 due to the upcoming general election in India between April and May 2024.  &quot;We will have to be wary of a slowdown in order inflow due to the upcoming general election and plans of the subsequent government that may take over,&quot; Raman said.  He added that order inflow in the first half of 2023-24 is likely to be higher than the second half of the financial year, with significant order inflow expected in the transportation, water, and public infrastructure space.  Raman also said that L&amp;amp;T is likely to meet the higher end of its revenue and order inflow guidance for 2023-24 and may consider revising its guidance for both revenue and operating margin after the October-December 2023 quarter.  At the start of 2023-24, L&amp;amp;T's management had said that they expect the engineering major's revenue to grow at 12-15 percent and order intake growth at 10-12 percent in the current financial year.  He added that L&amp;amp;T is seeing strong signs of high-order execution in 2024-25, buoyed by falling energy prices and headline inflation in global economies.  &quot;Prospect pipeline is reflective of capex tailwinds across India and West Asian countries,&quot; Raman said.  The reopening of China's economy and expectations that major oil-producing nations will continue to invest in oil and gas, industrialisation, and energy transition initiatives will augur well for the company’s projects business.  Raman also said that going forward, L&amp;amp;T's revenue share from international orders is likely to increase.  Buyback  Speaking about the proposed buyback of shares worth Rs 10,000 crore, as approved by the company's board on July 25, Raman said that he does not expect the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to deny L&amp;amp;T permission to go ahead with its buyback this time.  &quot;We don't need to take permission from SEBI for our proposed buyback as long as all buyback guidelines are met. We just have to inform them of the buyback plan after getting shareholders' approval,&quot; Raman said.  He added that the price at which L&amp;amp;T will complete its buyback has not been finalised yet and the tentative price of Rs 3,000 per share is the maximum price being considered by L&amp;amp;T at the moment.  Raman also said that once the shareholder's approval for the buyback is received, L&amp;amp;T will decide on a date for the buyback and final price.  He also said that on a consolidated level, L&amp;amp;T's cash-on-books stood at around Rs 40,000-45,000 crore as on June 30, 2023.  On a standalone basis, L&amp;amp;T's cash-on-books stood at around Rs 27,000 crore as on June 30, 2023.  According to the company's balance sheet shared on the bourses, its cash-on-books stood at Rs 58,093 crore as on March 31, 2023.  Raman also told reporters that the buyback is part of L&amp;amp;T's plan to improve RoE (Return on Equity) as part of the group's 'Lakshya 2026' plan.  He also said that L&amp;amp;T's board has approved a special dividend of Rs 6 as part of the celebration to honour executive Chairman AM Naik who will be stepping down on September 30, 2023.  Divestment  Raman added that there has not been any development in the divestment plans of L&amp;amp;T for now.  &quot;Will have to be patient to complete the divestment of the Hyderabad Metro Project,&quot; Raman said.  He added that L&amp;amp;T will continue to reduce the debt of the Hyderabad Metro Project and is continuously working to improve the operations of the metro service.  Raman also said that L&amp;amp;T has received around Rs 500 crore from the Telangana state government as part of the grant for the Hyderabad metro project.  He added that the daily ridership of Hyderabad Metro has risen to a peak of around 5 lakh daily passengers in the quarter ended June 2023.  &quot;For the first time ever, Hyderabad Metro reported a profit on operating level in Q1FY2024,&quot; Raman said.  He added that L&amp;amp;T hopes to complete the divestment of Nabha Power in 2023-24.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/lt-q1-results-operating-margins-from-infra-segment-expected-to-rise-from-january-march-quarter-says-cfo-11027071.html

The company’s board has approved the proposal to buy back 3.33 crore shares, representing 2.4 percent of the total paid-up equity share capital, at a maximum price of Rs 3,000 apiece, the company said in a statement.  The offer represents a premium of more than 17 percent to the July 25 closing price of Rs 2,561.95 . The buyback is subject to shareholders’ approval.  The buyback is subject to approval from the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi). This is L&amp;amp;T's second attempt after its earlier board-approved buyback for around Rs 9,000 crore was denied by Sebi in 2019, citing non-compliance with regulations.  &quot;Since the ratio of the aggregate of secured and unsecured debts owned by the company after buyback (assuming full acceptance) would be more than twice the paid-up capital and free reserves of the company based on consolidated financial statements..., the buyback offer is not in compliance with Section 68(2)(d) of Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 4(ii) of Sebi (Buy-back Securities) Regulations, 2018,” the regulator had said.  Since then, Sebi has amended its buyback norms for companies that have non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) or housing finance companies as their subsidiaries.  As part of Sebi's amendments, companies like L&amp;amp;T would be eligible for buyback if the aggregate of secured and unsecured debts owed by it to the paid-up capital and free reserves after buyback is less than 2:1 on both standalone and consolidated basis, excluding the kind of subsidiaries it mentioned.  However, the excluded subsidiaries must have a debt-to-equity ratio not exceeding 5:1 on a standalone basis for the parent company to proceed with the buyback.  As of March 2023, the debt-to-equity ratio for L&amp;amp;T and L&amp;amp;T Finance Holdings stood at 1.16 and 3.84. The post-buyback ratios can be assessed against Sebi's permissable limits once the repurchase size is known.

lt,2023-07-15T16:45:32+05:30,Pranay Sharma,Is the US turning India into its logistic hub?,"Experts worry that India will be drawn into military ties with the US, jeopardising ties with Russia and antagonising China.","The United States’ recent decision to conclude a Master Ship Repair Agreement with the Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T) shipyard is an attempt by the US to turn India into a hub for resupplying and maintenance of its naval vessels in South Asia.  Reports quoting the White House said the US Navy is close to finalising separate deals with two other shipbuilders in Mumbai and Goa.  However, some see the developments with concern and fear this is America’s plan to draw India closer to its military.  The proposed Indian hub is part of the US military’s search for more such facilities that will allow it to quickly handle resupply activities and repair in the Indo-Pacific and maintain its deterrence against the growing Chinese presence.  The agreement with L&amp;amp;T will allow the repair of US naval warships in its shipyard in Kattupalli near Chennai.  Reports say the first warship to be repaired is USNS Salvor, which has already arrived at the shipyard for repair and is scheduled to return in November.  Other shipyards in India can also be used for similar work after the US firms up agreements with them.  Under the partnership, the US will support India in developing the necessary infrastructure for resupply, repair, and maintenance of ships and aircraft.  Japan and Singapore at present serve as key naval hubs for the US in Asia.  According to the Pentagon press secretary, Air Force Brig. Gen Pat Ryder, much more would unfold in future, but the main aim for now is to make India a logistic hub for the US and its partners in the Indo-Pacific.  The China factor  Growing Indo-US defence ties are also being propelled by China’s aggressive rise in the region.  The joint statement issued at the end of the summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the US President Joe Biden in the US in June said “The US-India major Defence Partnership has emerged as a pillar of global peace and security.”  Some other recent developments indicate India’s tough attitude towards China. Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a stand-off at eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since May 2020.  Despite several rounds of talks, China has been reluctant to withdraw from several positions it occupied, violating agreements and protocols to maintain the status quo in the area.  India has maintained that normal relations will not be restored unless China withdraws from these positions.  India has also moved closer to Taiwan in recent months. Recently, it allowed Taiwan to open its trade and cultural centre in Mumbai — its third office in India after Delhi and Chennai.  India also broke its earlier ambiguity on a maritime dispute between the Philippines and China, expressing support for the 2016 arbitration ruling at The Hague, which rejected Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea.  In addition, India also allowed the visiting US Under-Secretary and Special Coordinator, Uzra Zeya, on Sunday to meet the Dalai Lama at his headquarters in Dharamshala — a decision which was a major departure from its past stand.  China doesn’t regard the Dalai Lama as a revered spiritual and cultural leader. It accuses him of indulging in anti-Chinese activities from Indian soil and has often urged Delhi not to encourage his meeting with visiting political leaders or officials.  On the other hand, US experts see the proposed hub in India as a significant development as securing “a maintenance and repair and logistic hub” in South Asia would allow the US Navy the “much-needed” flexibility in the vast Ocean region.  The US Navy currently operates from Diego Garcia and Western Australia to maintain its vigil over the Indian Ocean.  The Pentagon fears that China, which currently has about 355 ships and submarines, would continue to have an edge over the US navy if American vessels cannot spend more time at sea.  The risk of falling behind China in terms of naval capabilities and weakening deterrence has prompted the US to seek more hubs in the Indian Ocean and the Indo-Pacific region.  According to financial advisory firm KPMG, India is likely to spend about US$ 130 billion on defence procurement in the next five to seven years.  Since this will create massive opportunities for domestic industry given the government’s push for indigenisation, there will be ample opportunity for American companies entering the Indian defence market.  “The potential benefit to the Indian industrial base would be in the form of upgrading domestic infrastructure, capacity addition and research and development activities, ” KPMG said.  Strategic autonomy  However, India has so far maintained strategic autonomy and continues to build strong ties with Russia, its traditional strategic partner and main supplier of weapons.  But some Russian experts in the Indian establishment worry that the US is drawing India closer to its military.  “Buying arms from America is different from allowing a naval hub to the US,” says a former Indian diplomat.  He fears that soon the US will try to convince India to allow a naval base for the American navy. “This is not only a concern for China but also for Russia”, the diplomat added.  In September, India will chair the G20 summit in New Delhi where the president of America will be present along with his Chinese and Russian counterparts.  How India maintains close ties with both Washington and Moscow will be watched closely and with a lot of interest by strategists around the world.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/is-the-us-turning-india-into-its-logistic-hub-10965381.html

lt,2023-06-15T13:43:46+05:30,Rachita Prasad,"Hydrocarbon order pipeline at $20 billion, energy transition opportunities strong: L&amp;T Energy head","Subramanian Sarma, whole-time director and senior executive vice president (Energy), hopes that the company will win 15-20% of the orders it will bid for. In India, the government should give incentives for generation and demand creation when it comes to green hydrogen, he said.  ","There is a renewed interest in investments on fossil fuel after the Russia-Ukraine war, which has forced countries to revisit their energy security strategy, even as the global push on energy transition continues. Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Ltd (L&amp;amp;T) is well placed to gain from both, Subramanian Sarma, whole-time director and senior executive vice president (Energy), told Moneycontrol in an interview.  Sarma said that the company will bid for hydrocarbon orders worth $20 billion in the current fiscal year and hopes to convert 15-20 percent of that into executable orders. He said L&amp;amp;T is bullish about green hydrogen, as a developer and contractor. But the government needs to incentivise manufacturers as well as consumers to build a robust ecosystem.  Last year, L&amp;amp;T consolidated its hydrocarbon, thermal power and green energy operations into an energy vertical, which is now headed by Sarma.  Edited excerpts:  What is the order pipeline in the hydrocarbon space looking like? Based on your conversation with clients, what is their mood right now in terms of capex planning?  We are active in two markets -- India and overseas. The overseas market includes the Middle East and Africa. In the domestic market, we have good prospects in the refinery sector.  There is a Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL) project, which is likely to happen in Nagapattinam, and there is expansion coming up at Paradip for petrochemicals, and BPCL’s Bina refinery. There may be some other downstream chemicals projects from Reliance Industries Ltd and other private sector companies. There will also be projects for LNG regasification terminals and storage facilities. The domestic market was extremely busy in the last two years. It may be a little less than that now, but it will remain busy.  The Middle East is seeing huge capital expenditure. A lot of projects have been announced and we are quite busy bidding.  This year, we should be bidding for projects worth $20 billion (Rs 1,64,443 crore). Generally, our success rate could be anything between 15-25 percent.  (L&amp;amp;T’s Energy project segment had bagged orders worth Rs 30,750 crore in 2022-23).  Refinery projects have been facing challenges. India’s mega West Coast refinery has been delayed on environmental clearance and land acquisition. Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri has even said that, given the challenges in land acquisition, the country may look at setting up smaller refineries. Will this impact the order pipeline and average ticket size?  Refinery expansion will happen in India. There is no change in that as we are a growing economy. We will have more and more demand for refined products, as well as petrochemicals. I don't expect any change in terms of how much capacity we need to add.  Currently, the debate is how that will be added, whether it will be a mega refinery or we will add multiple smaller refineries. If you look at the talent and skill available, requirements of infrastructure and logistics, capability of handling mega projects, and the timeline required for those mega projects, I am of the view that more medium-sized refineries will be a better option than mega ones.  They may be smaller than mega projects, but even the medium-sized ones are still quite big. They were talking about 20 million tonnes or 60 million tonnes, but even 9 million-tonne capacity is still large enough. It still fits very well within our range of offering and remains of interest to us.  There have been delays in exploration bids and refinery projects in India. Should we be concerned about the pace of growth in the energy sector in India, especially in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war, which highlights the need for energy security?   No, I am not concerned about it as there has been a huge amount of activity in the refinery space in the last three years and it continues. Those projects still have to be finished. I think we have enough on the plate between domestic and international markets.  There are reports that funding to fossil fuels is slowing amidst concerns over climate change. Do you see this impacting international hydrocarbon projects and how are you insulating your business from this risk?  Globally, the trend of energy transition, in my view, has slowed down a bit, after the conflict in Europe. People are realising that there is a journey we have to go through for the transition; it cannot happen rapidly. Also, the cost of energy, if not affordable, should be at least reasonable. So maybe the energy transition ambitions and aspirations were a little bit far-fetched to start with; it is getting moderated.  Some of the very well-known international oil companies have also rolled back and said that they will continue to allocate capital for gas and oil, and not completely switch over to clean energy.  In the Middle Eastern market, there is still enough thrust in developing conventional oil and gas projects. In addition, they have also started the process of transitioning. So, they are looking at reducing carbon footprint, setting up carbon capture and blue ammonia and green ammonia. So now, we don’t just have an opportunity in conventional energy, but also in emerging energy transition projects. I am not concerned at this point in time. I believe that all sources of energy will coexist for at least the next five years.  The government is pushing the green hydrogen agenda and L&amp;amp;T is in a very sweet spot as you are both a developer and also an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) player in this space. Many companies have announced plans for green hydrogen. What is happening on the ground? Are they committing investment and looking to place orders?  I can’t speak for others who have announced projects and how far they have moved. As for L&amp;amp;T, we want to walk the talk. There will be four legs on which we will build our green energy strategy. One will be manufacturing of electrolysers, for which we have signed a technology licensing agreement. We are already in the process of building the manufacturing unit at Hazira, where we already have a pilot plant.  We are building a new manufacturing facility for electrolysers with technology from France-based McPhy. Our plan is to go to a gigawatt scale in phases. Hopefully in 2024, we'll see the first set of electrolysers rolling out.  The second priority is energy storage. We are searching for a technology partner and hope to announce it in the near future. The third leg is our EPC business, for which we will continue to bid for various tenders that are coming out and work on our own projects, if we decide to develop them. This will be dependent on the market.  The fourth focus area is the development role, where we have a joint venture with IOCL (Indian Oil Corporation Ltd) and ReNew for the domestic market, while we are on our own in the export market. Both are progressing as per plan. We are talking to various customers to look at some offtake agreements and purchase agreements.  In addition, we are also working on setting up our own R&amp;amp;D (research and development) centre to look at how we can indigenise the supply chain and how we can substitute with alternative materials to bring down the cost for some of these value chain components. We have a good plan and we are working on that. We will start seeing results from 2024.  The Indian government has approved an initial outlay of around Rs 20,000 crore for green hydrogen incentives. Some energy sector players believe this may not be enough to lure investments into the sector, especially given that countries across the world are aggressively offering incentives. What more can be done to make it lucrative in India?  Every country will have its own priorities. In India, our priority is energy security. But with that, affordability of energy is important. I think there are two ways the government can help. One, give incentives for generation and the second is to give incentives for demand creation.  The government has already put in enabling policies now to incentivise production and generation, be it in solar, or be it manufacturing under the PLI (production-linked incentives) scheme.  The second leg, which they are articulating or deliberating, is how do we create that incentive framework for demand creation. I think we are moving in the right direction.  There are concerns about the demand side for green hydrogen. How can demand creation be helped?  The fundamental problem is that price parity hasn't been achieved. There is still a gap between alternative and conventional sources of energy. How much are we prepared to pay a premium on decarbonisation, and whether this is the only method is something to be looked at. There has been a big push in biofuel and blending; there can be alternative methods. So you have to do it in a calibrated way, because if you go too fast, somebody has to pay that extra price.  At the same time, with improving technology, prices will come down. So you have to balance these factors. That's what the government and the industry is doing. I think India will become a key player in the future.  Oil prices have seen high volatility due to the Russia-Ukraine war, which disrupted the market at a time we were witnessing post-COVID recovery. With that backdrop, what will be the biggest challenge for the current fiscal?   As far as L&amp;amp;T is concerned, I am not too concerned because we have a strong order book to start with. (L&amp;amp;T’s consolidated order book stood at Rs 3,99,526 crore, as on March 31, 2023.)  We have a strong order pipeline, too. So, that gives us a certain amount of stability and certainty. Oil prices are in the $65-$75 range. They will also remain stable in that range, which is good for both suppliers and consumers. Besides,  there are opportunities in energy transition. I think the next 2-3 years will be reasonably stable. Our focus has been good execution and to make sure that customers remain satisfied, so that we can continue to gain increased market share.

Today, the Nifty and Sensex turned volatile","The Monetary Policy Committee has maintained the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in its bi-monthly review, while continuing to keep a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook.  Five of the six-member committee voted in favour of maintaining withdrawal of accommodation stance to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.  The interest rate decision by MPC is on expected lines, though few experts were expecting a possibility of change in policy stance to neutral.  The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures.  Headline inflation is projected to decline in 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23 but would still be above the target, warranting continuous vigil, said the RBI, adding the progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard.  The central bank lowered its FY24 inflation projection to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent earlier, and also to 4.6 percent from 5.1 percent for Q1FY24 and to 5.2 percent against 5.4 percent for Q2FY24.  &quot;As the RBI expects inflation to remain within its target range for the rest of the fiscal year, and with growth faring reasonably well, we think the RBI will stay on hold through the rest of FY24,&quot; Rahul Bajoria, MD and Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics at Barclays, said.  RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his policy address emphasised the need to bring down the CPI inflation to its 4 percent target consistently, saying that inflation being within the tolerance band itself was “not good enough”, Rahul pointed out.  The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months, the RBI said.  Also read: Market in see-saw mode post-RBI policy, here are the key factors at play  The central bank has maintained its current financial year growth projection at 6.5 percent, while expecting the real GDP growth for Q1FY24 at 8 percent and 6.5 percent for Q2FY24.

MMRDA, the state agency executing this project, floated a tender in January 2023 for two packages of civil construction work for the tunnel project that aims to reduce the travel time from Thane to Mumbai's western suburbs from 60 minutes to 15-20 minutes. The tunnels will also substantially cut carbon emissions from vehicles on that route.  “The work may start after the monsoon. This project is important for the connectivity in the region,” Srinivas said.  L&amp;amp;T and MEIL were the only two bidders when the technical bids were opened in April. When the financial bids were opened on April 25, MEIL was the lowest bidder for ‘Package 1’. L&amp;amp;T’s bid was the lowest for ‘Package 2’ but it was rejected later as the company had inadvertently mentioned the amount as the final bid but had not added the tax component to it, as required by the tender.  Subsequently, L&amp;amp;T moved the Bombay high court earlier this month, challenging its disqualification for ‘Package 1’ and asking the court to direct MMRDA to award the company ‘Package 2’. But the court rejected the two petitions.  Query sent to L&amp;amp;T and MEIL remained unanswered.  The project entails the construction of two road tunnels of 10.8 km each under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and the approach roads on both ends, which will provide a shorter route to commuters and help them bypass the congested route they currently use.  MEIL was the lowest bidder at Rs 7,464 crore for ‘Package 1’ which entails designing and construction of 5.75 kilometers from the Borivali side for the twin tunnel project.  L&amp;amp;T’s bid for ‘Package 2’ was Rs 6,625 crore but it was rejected as the amount would have been higher to factor in the taxes, officials said. MEIL bagged ‘Package 2’ which entails designing and construction of 6.09 kilometers from the Thane side for the twin tunnel project with a bid of bid Rs 6,937 crore.  The tunnels will have three lanes each and connect Ekta Nagar, Magathane in Borivali and Tikuji-Ni-Wadi at Manpada in Thane. The tunnel road will help reduce traffic congestion on Ghodbunder Road in Thane.  While announcing the project in July 2021, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who was the  Urban Development Minister at the time, had said that extra care will be taken to avoid any impact on the biodiversity of the national park.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/megha-engineering-beats-lt-to-bag-rs14400-crore-thane-borivali-twin-tunnel-project-mmrda-head-10575341.html

","Engineering major Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T) made two major announcements on May 10 — its financial result for the fourth quarter of 2023-24 and the transition in leadership. The company’s Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman spoke exclusively with Moneycontrol to share how the leadership change is expected to be seamless and how the company is on track to achieve the goals set up in its five-year strategic plan, Lakshya’26.  Raman said that the company is guarded about its prospects in India in the current fiscal, given the likelihood of the upcoming election disrupting the project ordering and execution process. He said that L&amp;amp;T is looking at an order pipeline worth Rs 10 lakh crore and hopes to maintain a winning rate of 15-20 percent. Edited excerpts:  L&amp;amp;T reported 17 percent growth in revenue, 12 percent in profit and 19 percent in order inflow in FY23. While the company met its guidance on revenue and order inflow growth, it missed on margins, which shrank from a year ago. How did FY23 pan out and what led to the shrinking of margin?   Thank you for raising this because this has been bothering a lot of people as to whether the company is under stress insofar as margin accrual is concerned. I think it's important to understand the breakup of this because much of the revenue that we have reported, Rs 1,83,000 crore is the portion that comes from the project business that has been executing jobs that we have won in FY21 and FY22. And these were unique periods in the sense that the jobs were given but costs at which we were to procure material and equipment actually skyrocketed. And also, these were given at a time when the post-COVID recovery was not really complete. There were interruptions, both in terms of supply chain, shipping goods, labour availability of the kind that is required to execute the project, the client's preparedness to open up his own facilities for us to execute the project... So the first casualty in all of this was time. We lost close to a year waiting for things to return to normalcy so that we could work to our plan. Kindly enough, the clients quickly agreed on time extensions.  So we avoided the prospect of any liquidated damages that could have harmed our P&amp;amp;L (profit and loss account). But what we had to do was to maintain the site as mobilised, in fact, invest a little more, making sure it is safe and a secure environment for people to stay and wait for necessary clearances. Consequently, the additional cost that we incurred is embedded in this margin erosion.  The second part of it is when the sites became available for us to work, we had to actually place orders and start procuring goods and equipment to complete the projects. By then, I think COVID became a worldwide phenomenon, and to complement this, the war also broke out in Europe, which actually threw the supply chain out of gear. And even if the vendors were ready, the shipping lines were not available. And there were a whole host of logistics issues that actually delayed the receipt of material. Meanwhile, prices kept going up, in fact, to an extent where 25-75 percent was the order of magnitude in the case of some underlying material or equipment that were dependent on them.  We have to deal with all of this. The ultimate objective of the company was to make sure that we deliver to the revised timeline that the client has agreed to. That meant that we had to catch up on execution, which is what is evident in FY23. As against the guidance of 12-15 percent, we actually ended the year with a revenue growth of 17 percent. And these percentages are on large bases. So I think that is reflective of the fact that we put more resources to make up for the lost time. Much of the cost we have accounted for in FY23 is the result of this inflationary input cost. We do think that the orders that we won in FY23, which is almost Rs 2,30,000 crore, have been procured on better terms. And in any case, the environment on supply chains is far more predictable today compared to 2021 and 2022. The softening of materials prices has been what was behind people expecting our margins to be met. But the softening of the materials price has happened in the last six months. And what we have reported in our numbers are not necessarily what we have committed to procure in the last six months. These are commitments and procurements made over the past years.  The projects need to be completed. I believe that it will take possibly two or three more quarters for all of these commitments to get completed for us to sit across with the client and start discussing price variations. Contractually, there are many contracts which have this permitted as a price variation formula. We need to translate this into actual numbers, support them with data and make our respective claims. But this is an ongoing process in the projects business. This will happen over a period of 12 months after the project gets completed. So you will see the softness of the margin that we have reported in FY23 play out definitely during the first half of the current year as well, FY24. The trajectory will change as we complete our past commitments during Q3 or Q4 of FY24. So I see 2024-25 to be a more normalised year where the margins with which we bid for a project are close to being achieved. Of course, I'm making a big prediction that nothing destabilising or a black swan event will happen in 2024-25. But keeping that aside, I think that the worst in terms of absorbing the cost for past obligations is by and large done with.  You have given a revenue growth guidance of 12-15 percent and an order intake growth guidance of 10-12 percent in 2023-24. Are you being conservative or do you see challenges in the current fiscal year?  There are two different dynamics. Orders, we have a very large base. I mean Rs 2, 30,000 crore, and anything to grow on that by very strong numbers is a function of how investments happen in the system around us. I think that will drive the actual outcome as to how much we make. But based on the pipeline that we have and our own assessment that we make every now and then of what is likely to materialise, what is not, we think 10-12 percent seems to be a reasonable bet. I have also taken into account in this guidance that this year could be a little lower than the 12-month period because of the election. We do not know. The dates are not yet announced.  But it is quite prudent to assume that we may not have the entire 12-month calendar to walk through this year for our plans. It could get truncated depending on the election situation. Because in the run-up to the election, there are periods where I think the priorities of the government change. And consequently, the thrust that has been given over the last 12 to 18 months or even 24 months about ramping up, scaling of projects, awarding more, etc., could take a bit of a breather. That is inbuilt into our assessment. If none of those happens and the election really is announced in 2024-25 and it doesn't affect up to March 2024, maybe then the upsides could exist, but we don't know now.  Secondly, as far as revenue is concerned, for the same reason of it being an election period, the disruptions that could happen, etc. We have factored in the possibility of a little bit of a truncated year. And as I mentioned to you, the execution of the orders that we won in 2023 will actually happen after about 12 months. The first six to nine months will go into engineering work, approvals and clearances. Then, the next couple of months will go on procurement, order placement, negotiating with vendors, etc. The actual work on the field will happen in the following year. So for 2023 order wins, 2024-25 would be the year where you will see execution on the ground, and hence margin accruals. During the engineering and all that procurement, there are no margins that really accrue. The cost gets accumulated but margins don't accrue. And by then hopefully, the backlog that I have today of Rs 4 lakh crore, which is Rs 2.31 crore of current wins and about Rs 1.7 lakh of the past wins — this Rs 1.7 lakh will get washed through the period largely of 2024 and partly of 2025. What is remaining is the tail portion of the old contracts, which is why I feel the first two-three quarters, if the margins are soft, they're soft for a reason. And the recovery of margins from Q4 of the current year into the following year could possibly get us back to more normal times.  L&amp;amp;T derived a majority of its orders from government-backed projects. Against the backdrop of the upcoming election and the possibility of slowing of government orders, what is your expectation from the private sector? Are we seeing a pickup in capex and what are the sectors which you think might be driving growth this financial year?  Interesting that you speak about it, because statistically, in FY22 we had of the incremental orders that we won in FY22, we had 26 percent or thereabouts from the private sector. And when I talk about the private sector, I am geography-neutral. I mean, whether it is India or overseas, putting it all together. That number moved up to 32 percent in FY23. So the year that we just reported, 32 percent of the projects in the manufacturing business had private sector orders and it's only 68 percent had the government as a sponsor, whether it's state, Centre or PSUs. Where has this movement happened? I think one place where the movement has happened is in the area of steel and metals, basically metals, because I think the pricing power the market seems to have appreciated and they're investing in capacity. So we won a fair bit of orders in our minerals and metals business.  The second bit is all the airport orders and the station redevelopment orders, etc., they're all maybe government-enabled, but executed by the private sector, the concessionaires are from the private sector. So that's the second piece that has moved.  The third piece that has moved is the automobile industry in this transition of normal vehicles to EV (electric vehicle) and stuff like that. A lot of additional add-on investments for additional lines have come in from this sector. And since we have been building automobile plants, etc., we have also benefited from that. The ancillary industry associated with automobiles, the tyre-making machinery, etc., have also seen a lot of pickup and we find orders for tyre manufacturing equipment and businesses pick up. Given the activity that is generally there in the infrastructure space, the construction and mining equipment business has picked up. And there're also orders from that sector. For example, we received large orders from groups like the Tatas, Jindals, etc., which significantly pushed up the ratio for that vertical for private sector orders.  Then, we look at the whole space of energy transition. The investments that the private sector is making — and this you could attribute to possibly the ESG (environment, social and governance) thrust or the general awareness about wanting to be more climate-friendly, and hence more sustaining—is making people invest in zero water discharge or in effluent treatment or even renewable energy. These are all happening within the private sector space. That’s not to say the public sector is not interested in this. For example, IOC (Indian Oil Corporation) is making big moves on green energy. But those are yet to hit the order book. But private sector orders are much smaller and they are quicker.  Then finally, the whole space of data centres and healthcare systems. These are two areas where the private sector is investing. Hospitals are being built, data centres are being built. The whole issue around data privacy and localisation of data, etc., is also making the IT companies pack services on top of the data centres that are being built. And India being the IT powerhouse it becomes a natural space for hyperscalers to look at.  Commercial real estate is another area for the private sector. And we do think with some amount of momentum picking up on the return to working from office, this will get rejigged. Companies are now beginning to create capacities in Tier 2 towns. Earlier, everybody was focusing on Tier 1 because that is where talent was supposedly available. Today, talent has migrated from Tier 1 to Tier 2. So you have to have enabling infrastructure in Tier 2 towns. That is also being done by the private sector. So I see while there is no wholesale jump in private sector capex, incrementally, based on the sectors that are engaged in growth, these investments are happening and I think this will gather pace. We need to be a little more patient because the private sector balance sheet after a lot of effort has been cleaned up. I don't think they will forget the lessons in a hurry. And they won't go on a big binge on investing in capacities without being sure of the returns that they generate.  L&amp;amp;T undertakes a massive exercise at the beginning of every fiscal year to assess opportunities. What is the order pipeline looking like for FY23-24 in the domestic market as well as the international market? What is the pipeline? In a good-case scenario, how much of these orders can you win?  We normally look at the pipeline from the perspective of what interests L&amp;amp;T. So the bigger outlier of what is happening in the overall economy is something that I'm keeping out of this limited conversation. When we looked at what could interest us, the pipeline seemed to suggest something like Rs 10 lakh crore as projects that are likely to come through. Now, these are sectors where we are deeply involved in. Out of this Rs 10 lakh crore, you can say roughly 35 percent would be international, 65 percent domestic. Let me break this down a little more for you. Of this Rs 10 lakh crore, about Rs 6.5 lakh crore is what we assess broadly, I am just rounding off on a ballpark basis. Rs 6.5 lakh crore would be for the infrastructure sector and this would be across buildings and factories, power transmission, transportation infra, heavy civil, minerals, metals — all of that put together. We think the energy space led by hydrocarbons would see about Rs 2.5 lakh crore. This will be both onshore and offshore investments. We expect maybe 60 percent of this to happen in the international markets and only about 40 percent in the domestic market.  Given the demand for power and the need for the government, particularly in an election year, to ensure power availability, we think there will be one or two opportunities in traditional coal-fed or gas-fed power plants. Limited opportunities for us, given that BHEL (Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd) is a very large competitor. But possibly put together, about Rs 30,000-50,000 crore worth of opportunities could exist including the desulfurisation campaign, where all the old rundown power plants are getting refurbished to reduce emissions and pollutants. Between the rest of the businesses we run, it could be another Rs 2 lakh crore. So, put together, this Rs 10 lakh crore is what we look at. Normally, when we do this exercise and actually look back and see how we have fared against this pipeline, our win rate has been between 15 percent and 20 percent.  So, we think out of this Rs 10 lakh crore, about Rs 2 lakh crore could be what could come our way. Now, this obviously excludes the growth in the services business collectively between the IT companies. We are today about $5 billion. We expect to keep the momentum in that sector at 15 percent growth year-on-year, and in a good year, it could go to 20-22 percent as had happened in 2023. In 2023, we reported almost a 27 percent growth. But if you even normalise it to 20 percent, averaging between 15 percent and 27 percent, that could keep us engaged as well. So, on top of the Rs 2,31,000 crore that we have done, we see about Rs 2,60,000-2,65,000 crore as potential wins. And that adds up to this 10-12 percent guidance we have given.  L&amp;amp;T has a stated strategy to increase the share of IT and services to its total business. In this business, at a micro level, you have seen some high-level exits after the merger of L&amp;amp;T Infotech and Mindtree. On a macro level, global IT majors are being cautious about the demand outlook. Given these two challenges, what’s your strategy to achieve the target of 15-20 percent growth?  See, exits seem to be a way of life for the IT world. I very rarely see that the same team continues for a long period of time. By contrast, at L&amp;amp;T, you will have people working for 25, 30, 35 years quite easily. You don't get that kind of profile in IT. So in IT, our orientation should be to get the right skill pool for a certain project or a set of projects that we are working on and making sure there is no exit midway to create disruption in that project. Secondly, the integration that we attempted between Mindtree and LTI has gone on rather smoothly. If you consider a total resource pool of 95,000 people between these two companies, I think the exits that have happened have been a very small number. This is something that we were anticipating, but happy to report that the outcome has been far better than what could have been our worst-case scenario in such a situation.  As far as growth is concerned, I think all the big players—and we consider ourselves fairly small, I mean, $5 billion at the end of the year, there are companies which do this in one quarter—their assessment of opportunities and delta growth is like our infrastructure growth. Since the base is so large, they think to grow at 20 percent is a huge task. So these IT companies are possibly having scale as an issue when it comes to delta percentages. L&amp;amp;T Infotech and Mindtree combined, being that much smaller and operating in a more nimble fashion at another level of client engagement, we think that this level of clients have not pushed back on their programmes. In fact, whatever business model transition programmes that they were working on, they have to complete. They can't abandon it midway. What is under question is, how much of discretionary spend will they commit themselves to going forward? Our sense is that given our base, we see clients possibly remaining engaged with us for this growth that we are talking about. But at the moment, we are too small to really put out a caution, saying that growth has become a concern for us. I think we need to make sure that the opportunities that do not go to the large companies, because of whatever filters that they have, we're able to grab and make inroads in those accounts.  The other big announcement from L&amp;amp;T is the change in leadership with AM Naik stepping down from the position of non-executive chairman, after 58 years with the company. This change is happening at a time when L&amp;amp;T has embarked on its most ambitious strategic five-year plan thus far — Lakshya '26– which aims to double revenue and order inflow in five years by 2025-26. The plan also includes exiting non-core operations and expansion of the services business. How is it going and what challenges do you foresee?  This transition couldn't have been as seamless as it has actually been. I think one of us has actually taken on the larger responsibility. You approach it as one of our colleagues having gotten to this important position, and Mr Naik's shoes are huge to fill. That, I think, everybody concedes. Evaluating how successful the transition has been will not be so focused on as it would have been in the case of some external third party coming in and assuming leadership. Here, I think it is just the question of continuing the momentum. Mr Naik has provided us with a fantastic base and we couldn't have asked for more. I think it will be our collective job to make sure that we are able to support the vision and the plans of the new leadership, and make sure we take the company forward, so that we can possibly do to our successes what Mr Naik has done to us. To that extent, I think this transition was very well-planned and has been smoothly executed.  Now, coming to the question of Lakshya, I think it was ambitious in 2021 when we were just off COVID. We still set ourselves a target of doubling the order inflow, doubling the revenue and, most importantly, doubling the ROE (return on equity). We were at 9 percent ROE. We said we'll go to 18 percent ROE. All this meant that we have to do things that make our costs competitive, make our technology futuristic, be able to be relevant to the client in terms of execution and be profitable. And all of this has to be done. The levers for all of this would be to make sure that, are very efficient when it comes to resource utilisation, be it men, be it machines, be it money. I think we need to be extremely careful about how we use our resources. Two, we have to take advantage of the fast-evolving technology to be able to improve our productivity. Again, the fact that today we can track most of the things that people or machines do enables us to possibly take calls on optimising the use of resources. And that is something that we should continue to press on, because I think we are just still nibbling at the tip of the iceberg in terms of what potentially we can do to transform the company.  Third, we have already completed two years of the Lakshya plan and we are actually bang-on in terms of the path so far. The challenge would come in possibly the last two years of the plan, where like the slog overs in T20 the asking rate creeps up. I think we are a year away from having to sort of ascend that final peak, which we are confident that if we continue to work the way we did in 2023 and continue to do things to improve the margin profile then we should be able to get there. As far as ROE is concerned, I think it's also a function of a) completing the divestments so that the losses that we were booking in our books on account of these infrastructure investments disappear. And, b) make sure, as I spoke to you earlier, the normalcy returns to our core business.  Three, scale up our services business, which is the most profitable piece of the portfolio that we run. And fourth is to make sure that the extra cash that we have, we are able to share it with the shareholders. The recent dividend declaration of Rs 24 per share has a 43 percent payout ratio. L&amp;amp;T normally has been paying out at 25-30 percent. It has not been paying out 40 percent and thereabouts. We'll continue to do this. We are not looking at the Lakshya period for any big-bang investments. In terms of acquisition, there would be tuck-in acquisitions, etc., that will happen in the services space, that will continue. But services businesses are run in a separate listed company's balance sheet. So I don't think L&amp;amp;T's core shareholders need to worry about that. L&amp;amp;T's own growth plans involve normal investment in capex, maybe some investments in this green energy transition and data centre. But beyond that, we don't have much debt to service. So if we are able to conclude our Lakshya plan well, I think there's a good opportunity for us to share our fortunes with shareholders.   Would you like to put a number on the capex that you're planning?  About Rs 4,000 crore is what we normally set aside annually for capital expenditure on strategic equipment. Maybe another couple of thousand crores for this green energy transition and maybe a couple of thousand crores for the data centre that we are working on. So, put together, on the cash that we generate on a year-to-year basis, something like Rs 13,000-14,000 crore. If our working capital is managed as efficiently as we have done so far, I see the debt servicing obligations being very limited, the annual capex can be conveniently met out of this, and there will be cash to spare.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/eyeing-order-pipeline-worth-rs-10-lakh-cr-aim-to-maintain-order-win-rate-of-15-20-lt-cfo-10569871.html

Goldman Sachs said a weak margin remains an area of disappointment. A weak margin offset an otherwise strong outlook, it added. Core EBITDA margin came in at 8.7 percent, flat QoQ and 80 bps lower YoY.  Even CLSA said that a decline in core engineering and construction margins was also a disappointment. Moreover, the key surprise was mega defence orders which L&amp;amp;T did not announce.  At 09:57 am, L&amp;amp;T was quoting at Rs 2,241.05, down Rs 125.70, or 5.31 percent. The scrip was trading with volumes of 104,987 shares today, as compared with its thirty-day average of 79,903 shares, an increase of 31 percent.  The Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) major L&amp;amp;T on May 10 reported a consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 2023 at Rs 3,987 crore, up 10 percent compared to Rs 3,621 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue stood at Rs 58,335 crore, a growth of 10 percent from Rs 52,851 crore a year ago.  CLSA highlighted that the company’s Q4 beat three out of four guidance targets and the management guided for an even stronger FY24 on a higher base.

Catch up on all LIVE stock market updates here  Goldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ rating on the EPC major’s shares with a target price of Rs 2,540.  HDFC Securities said that the margin was impacted largely by higher input prices in projects and manufacturing portfolios.  FY23 order inflow rose 20 percent YoY to Rs 2.3 trillion, even as 4Q inflows increased marginally around 3 percent YoY given a high base. Order book at Rs 4 trillion as of March FY23 is at a record high. International orders share has increased to 43 percent in the quarter under review from 39 percent in Q4 FY22 while private orders share declined to 18 percent from 22 percent.  L&amp;amp;T has guided for an order book and sales growth of 10–12 percent and 12–15 percent respectively for FY24 along with margin guidance of 9–9.1 percent given 40 percent of older projects, which had cost hits, have been already executed while the remaining shall get executed over next 12–24 months.  Talking about profitability, the company said in its conference call that after an 8.6 percent core EBITDA margin for FY23, it believes the worst is behind us for the projects it secured. Orders that the company bagged in later FY22 and in FY23 factor into account current input costs and better margin trajectories which it will see in the latter part of FY24.  Nuvama Institutional Equities has factored in the upper end of sales growth guidance of 12–15 percent with a delayed margin recovery.

The company, however, missed its guidance for margin which declined year-on-year.  “We are conscious of the fact that towards the end of current year FY24 the country gets into Union Elections. In a sense, we will have to look at this year as a truncated year…we will have to wait and watch depending on how the election mode interferes with decision making on some of these projects,” said Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman.  L&amp;amp;T’s consolidated order book stood at Rs 399,526 crore as on March 31, 2023, with international orders accounting for 28 percent. Order inflow in the fiscal was Rs 230,528 crore, up 19 percent year-on-year, beating the 12-15 percent guidance. Government-backed domestic infrastructure orders were among the top drivers for order inflow.  “There could be some slowdown in new project announcements because as we move closer to the election, the government could be more focused on what catches the voters’ interest. If they are still fighting for ‘roti-kapda-makaan’, some of the allocations could go towards priority sectors,” Raman said.  He added that the better-than-expected tax collection for the government may support capex.  Post Covid execution weighed on margin  Raman said that while L&amp;amp;T’s Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA) margin declined to 8.6 percent in FY24 from 9.3 percent a year ago, the company aims to improve it to 9 percent  in FY24.  L&amp;amp;T reported consolidated revenues of Rs 183,341 crore for the year ended March 31, 2023, up 17 percent on year, driven by strong execution of a large order book in the infrastructure projects segment and robust momentum in the information technology and services segment.  But even as the company tried to make up for lost time during the pandemic by pushing execution, the higher cost of execution dented the EBITDA margin.  “The margins that we reported in FY22 was about 9.3 percent. As we started FY23, the idea was to protect the margin and see whether we can work on improving it. But for the revenue to grow, we had to complete contractual obligations and beyond a certain point we had to take the input cost in our stride and complete the project to make up for the loss of time in the previous year due to Covid,” Raman said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/lts-fy24-revenue-growth-seen-at-12-15-order-intake-growth-at-10-12-cfo-10562511.html

On completion, it will reduce the travel time from Thane to Borivali from 60 minutes to 15-20 minutes.","Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Ltd (L&amp;amp;T) and Megha Engineering &amp;amp; Infrastructures Ltd (MEIL) seemed on course to secure jobs worth Rs 14,000 crore to build the ambitious Thane-Borivali twin tunnel project in Mumbai.  The two companies were found as lowest bidders after the financial bids were opened on April 25, two officials involved with the process told Moneycontrol.  Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the state agency executing this project, floated a tender in January for two packages of civil construction work for the tunnel project that aims to reduce the travel time from Thane to Mumbai western suburbs from 60 minutes to 15-20 minutes. This will also substantially cut carbon emission from vehicles on that route.  Both engineering and construction companies bid the lowest price for two different packages of the Thane-Borivali tunnel road project. L&amp;amp;T and MEIL were the only two bidders when the technical bids were opened earlier this month. “MEIL and L&amp;amp;T are the lowest bidders. But the LoA (letter of award) is yet to be issued,” one of the sources said.  Typically, after identifying the lowest bidder, MMRDA has a process of approval after which the project is awarded officially.  In response to Moneycontrol’s query, a MMRDA official declined to comment on the lowest bidders but added that the process to award the project is underway and will be completed soon. L&amp;amp;T and MEIL are yet to respond to Moneycontrol’s email query.  The project aims to build two road tunnels of 10.8 km each under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and the approach roads on both ends, which will provide a shorter route to commuters and help them bypass the congested route they use now. The government is keen to start work on the project before monsoon this year.  MEIL has bid Rs 7,464 crore for Package 1, which entails designing and construction of 5.75 km from the Borivali side for the twin tunnel project. L&amp;amp;T, on the other hand, bid Rs 6,625 crore for Package 2 that covers designing and construction of 6.09 km from the Thane side for the twin tunnel project.  The tunnels will have three lanes each and connect Ekta Nagar, Magathane in Borivali and Tikuji-Ni-Wadi at Manpada in Thane. The tunnel road will help reduce traffic congestion on Ghodbunder Road in Thane.  While announcing the project in July 2021, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who was the  Urban Development Minister at the time, had said that extra care will be taken to avoid any impact to the biodiversity of the national park.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/lt-meil-emerge-lowest-bidders-for-thane-borivali-twin-tunnel-project-sources-10478811.html

The company has seen a strong growth of 30 percent YoY in the first nine months of FY23.  Jefferies believes L&amp;amp;T is in a sweet spot where both domestic and Middle East businesses have a good outlook. This is keeping in mind that Rs 98 billion is the needed announcements, assuming 50 percent of orders is unannounced and there is another month to go.  Pre-election impact worry  The concern is because National elections in India are slated for May 2024. Election code of conduct requires no material decisions at the Centre level should be taken six months prior to elections which implies Centre's order flow will come to a near halt from November 2023.

Domestic orders were the dominant share while overseas proportion rose in two of the three periods, Jefferies highlighted.  The brokerage firm believes the possible reasons are embargo does not apply to orders awarded by centre PSUs and States that are not going into elections, sector and client diversification, and higher overseas contribution. It sees order flow in FY24 to be frontended as Q4 might see some slowdown as seen in FY09 and FY14.  Pre- and Post-election trend in L&amp;amp;T shares  “Share price has held up into elections &amp;amp; been muted post,” Jefferies said. Pre-election headline announcements on potential road, railways, ports capacity expansion is news flow that helps capex-linked stocks. Post elections, stocks tend to have a more muted performance, it added.

lt,2023-04-10T15:28:43+05:30,Nickey Mirchandani,March quarter will be the best ever for L&amp;T: Elixir Equities Director Dipan Mehta,"Besides IT and banking, he’s also positive about the capital goods and construction space, and has high hopes of firms like ITD Cementation, NCC, ABB, Siemens, and Thermax.","The capital goods sector is expected to be a good bet as most infrastructure and capital goods companies such as L&amp;amp;T, ITD Cementation, and NCC are likely to report exceptional numbers for the March quarter, said Dipan Mehta, Founder and Director, Elixir Equities, in an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol.  He expects most of the engineering and capital goods companies to report strong order flows and completion of projects before the end of the financial year. Within the basket, he expects L&amp;amp;T to be the winner, with March being the best quarter ever for the company.  Mehta also believes IT companies will sustain growth rates and the industry’s operating margins will improve. He expects Infosys to report exceptional numbers. In the mid-cap space, companies like KPIT and Tata Elxsi will continue to deliver, he added.  Edited excerpts from the conversation:  What do you make of the markets right now? Specifically, I want to chat about city gas distribution companies because finally the Kirit Parikh recommendations have been implemented.  The last few trading sessions have been very encouraging. If we're able to build on these gains that would be great for the market, but any further declines from here would certainly damage the medium-term prospects on a technical basis.  On a fundamental basis, for the time being, I think we are seeing positive FII (foreign institutional investor) flows. On the whole a lot of investors are cautiously optimistic because there have been many challenges in the quarter gone by, but there have been many positives too. I think we just need to wait and watch. Let a few trading sessions go, see how we're getting into the earnings season, and then maybe take a call on the medium-term prospects of the market.  Coming specifically to city gas distribution companies, on the whole we are not very positive on the sector. The reason for that is that just as we are seeing with oil marketing companies, the trend is towards greater electrification. Which will impact city gas companies in terms of long-term growth as more and more EVs (electric vehicles) come into play. Although the near-term earnings will remain strong, EV disruption will impact the long-term PE (price-earning) multiples of these companies.  The implementation of the Kirit Parikh committee’s recommendations, I think, is slightly negative for these companies because of the price caps. On the whole, I would say that there are other interesting opportunities rather than city gas distribution.  Investors can look at segments like banking, infrastructure, select consumption-oriented stocks, and software.  What are your expectations of the IT sector? Accenture has reported their numbers already. Do you think the largecaps in this space have room to grow after the beating they’ve taken?  Looking at Accenture’s numbers and whatever commentary is coming through, it's not as bad as we’d feared. Companies which have been aggressive with marketing, going after big deals like, say, Infosys or Coforge has been, I think for them the growth rates will be only marginally impacted. But there may be players who significantly underperform their peers. This earnings season will separate the boys from the men.  Companies focused on specific verticals or specific service offerings will be the ones who will manage to grow. Companies like Infosys should report exceptional numbers given the order book they’re sitting on, and even the guidance will be more or less in line with what the street is expecting.  On the whole, we should see the industry improve on its operating profit margin. Within the midcap space, I think companies like KPIT and Tata Elxsi will continue to deliver because of their niche offerings in the auto segment where the IT spends have remained robust. We’re also positive on companies like Coforge and LTIMindtree.  Is the US banking crisis a thing of the past? How do you see banks performing in Q4?  The US banking crisis has had absolutely no impact on our banks. In fact, it has been good for us because I have heard of money flowing into some banks that have branches in GIFT city.  Our banking sector has not seen such healthy balance sheets and financials in decades. Lending is easy for banks at this point of time, the NPA (non-performing asset) cycle hasn't turned, and the cost of credit is restricted. The biggest challenge for the sector is the resource crunch due to tight liquidity conditions. Raising deposits is a challenge for both NBFCs and banks.  Given that, the strategy should be to go for good quality banks and NBFCs which have an edge when it comes to raising resources, like HDFC Bank, Kotak, Axis, and ICICI. I would prefer these companies, HDFC Bank in particular, because they've been focusing very heavily on raising deposits and maintaining their CASA (current account, savings account) ratio. If they have low-cost deposits in a rising interest rate scenario, that would be very good for net interest margins (NIM).  Within the NBFC (non-banking financial company) space, I would bet on companies like Bajaj Finance, which are extremely well-placed in terms of raising deposits. If you look at their quarterly results, the main number they’ve highlighted is the kind of deposits they have raised.  At some point of time when the net interest margin of the industry as a whole will come under pressure, companies with a good brand and a good resource mobilisation system in place will be the winners.  Coming to valuations, I think those are very attractive. I think there are no real concerns in the next two, three years in terms of growth. NPAs are well within control and a lot of the large finance-consuming sectors, like auto, real estate, infrastructure, etc., are doing very well. So the demand is also very strong.  Now about the real estate sector. Home sales is the best we’ve seen in many years. But then we also have high interest rates. How do you view the space overall? We have seen that upgrade coming in on Godrej Properties today, after a sharp correction in the month of Jan. Do valuations look attractive?  We're very positive on the sector on a medium to long-term basis. But one needs to be selective with real estate. While the last few quarters have been very good for the sector, you could expect a mild cyclical downswing. I think that has to be accounted for. The next two, three quarters may be a bit challenging for the sector as a whole, including for companies like Godrej Properties, Macrotech, and DLF.  We will see the base effect coming into play. Due to pent-up demand post-Covid, change in tax rules, etc., a lot of real estate sales were preponed to the last financial year. Therefore, one should build in a slight lull April onwards for a few months. With the interest rate scenario being a bit uncertain, you could expect a mild impact on demand as well.  Maybe you will see some correction over the next few months in real estate stocks, but that could be a great opportunity for entry. The sector as a whole is in an 8-10 year upswing. Once interest rates start to stabilise, maybe even drift lower, you will see demand pick up again.  There is a great requirement for good quality construction, especially in the affordable sector. Commercial real estate and hospitality are also picking up. So medium to long-term prospects of real estate are exceptionally good. But in the short term, for the next one or two quarters, I don't have very high expectations in terms of financials from any of the real estate companies.  Overall in Q4, which are the pockets or sectors you think would really outperform or surprise the markets? Leaving aside IT and banking, which names could surprise the street?  The entire engineering and construction space. Stocks like L&amp;amp;T, ITD Cementation, NCC, ABB, Siemens, Thermax – companies in the infrastructure and the capital goods space. They’re going to report exceptional numbers as Jan-March is usually very good for such firms because their clients need them to consume the budgets and finish the projects by March.  Their order flow also is also very strong because many government as well as semi-government agencies have March as the deadline for initiating new projects. Capital goods is a sector that performs at all times: the short, medium, and the long-term.  In this, the top pick has to be L&amp;amp;T. See the kind of orders that keep coming in. Unfortunately, the management doesn't disclose the size of the orders anymore. I suspect this quarter may be the best ever for L&amp;amp;T. And though I know that the stock has been outperforming, it still has a long way to go given the dynamics of the industry.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/march-quarter-will-be-the-best-ever-for-lt-elixir-equities-director-dipan-mehta-10389421.html
lt,2023-04-10T12:53:26+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Top 10 trading ideas for next 3-4 weeks as bulls push indices to a month's high,A falling wedge formation and an Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern have both broken out on DLF. We are able to clearly observe a Bullish Marubozu candlestick pattern on the weekly time period,"Bulls retained their reign on Dalal Street for the second consecutive week ended April 6, taking the Nifty50 to a one-month peak and the BSE Sensex near its psychological 60,000 mark, especially after the Reserve Bank slammed the brakes on rate hikes.  The Nifty50 climbed 239 points or 1.4 percent to 17,599, and formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly scale, making higher highs higher lows for second consecutive week. The index returned above the 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) with the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) giving a positive crossover, indicating the favourable trend.  Hence, the Nifty50 may find resistance at the 17,600-17,800 zone and, if these levels get surpassed, then all eyes on the psychological 18,000 mark, with supports at 17,500-17,300 and 17,200 levels, experts said.  &quot;One should not become complacent and should not rule out the possibility of a breather after the steep rally. 17,500-17,400 is likely to cushion any short-term blip, while the sacrosanct support lies around the bullish gap of 17,200 in the comparable period,&quot; Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Research at Angel One said.  On the flip side, he feels the 17,600-17,700 is likely to be seen as an immediate hurdle and an authoritative breach beyond the same could only trigger the next leg of rally in Nifty towards 17,800 for the upcoming week.  Going ahead, one needs to keep a close tab on the mentioned levels and continue with a buy-on-decline strategy for the time being, Osho advised.  Technical Analyst and Trader, Amit Seth also advised if the market gives an opportunity in the form of a dip towards support levels (17,200-17,300), it would be an opportunity to create fresh long positions with a good risk reward.  Technically a small pullback and consolidation would be healthy for Nifty and enable it to make fresh record highs in April, he said.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the April 6 closing prices:  Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  BHEL: Buy | LTP: Rs 71 | Stop-Loss: Rs 65 | Target: Rs 78 | Return: 10 percent  The stock has formed a higher bottom after rebounding from a low of Rs 67.60. It was higher than Rs 66.30 on February 27. The volume indicator suggests the price to buy support from the last 3 days.  Based on the longer-term averages, the stock was trading near the support of 200-days SMA (simple moving average) which stood at Rs 67.20 on the reversal date.  In short, the reversal has taken place with the help of several indicators, which will make a case for buying the stock with a positional approach. On the upside, resistance will lie at Rs 74 and Rs 78. Put stop-loss at Rs 65.    Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,932 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,700 | Target: Rs 6,550 | Return: 10 percent  It is diverging positively on the daily and weekly charts, indicating a pause in the prevailing trend or change in the trend. The stock was falling before Friday's reversal.

The recent breakout of the Rounding Bottom pattern confirms continuation of the prior uptrend.,"Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital  On the monthly timeframe of Nifty Index, after experiencing three consecutive months of negative returns, the previous month has formed a Doji candlestick pattern. This suggests a sense of indecisiveness in the market following a four-month downtrend. The recent low of 16,828.35 in the Nifty aligns closely with the lows observed in September and October 2022, thereby making it a significant level of support to monitor going forward.  On the weekly timeframe, the Nifty has exhibited a notable price action development after a span of 17 weeks. Specifically, the index has closed above the prior week's high, forming a higher high and higher low pattern. This upward momentum was observed after a bounce from the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level, which was calculated based on the prior advance from 15,183.40 in June 2022 to the high of 18,887.60 in December 2022.  On the daily time frame a classical breakout of the double bottom pattern can be witnessed around the same levels mentioned above. The breakout is confirmed as it is accompanied by a Gap. The 20-day SMA (simple moving average 17,216) have also been surpassed which acted as a variable resistance to the prices.  The index has a strong support at 17,312 (weekly low) followed by 17,100 (key support). While on the higher side the mark of 17,650 (key resistance) followed by 17,800 (swing high) are crucial levels to watch out for.  It is possible that if the index were to exceed 17,650, it could experience a positive upward momentum and potentially reach levels as high as 17,800. Conversely, if the index were to fall below 17,312, it may lose strength and experience a downward trend, potentially even falling as low as 17,100.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  KEI Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,744.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,680 | Target: Rs 1,960 | Return: 12 percent  The ratio charts of KEI against benchmark index Nifty show a rising trend, indicating strong outperformance of the stock. The recent breakout of the Rectangle pattern confirms continuation of the prior uptrend.  The prices have sustained well above the 18 &amp;amp; 50-day EMA (exponential moving average), indicating the presence of an uptrend.  On both the weekly and daily timeframes, the stock price is above the 50 mark, indicating positive momentum.  Moving forward, we anticipate the stock price to rise to the level of Rs 1,960, with a recommended stop-loss of Rs 1,680 on a closing basis.    Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,257.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,140 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 11 percent  L&amp;amp;T has demonstrated a notable uptrend. Despite experiencing a correction from mid-December 2022, the prices did not break supports and underwent a polarity change around Rs 2,080 level. This observation underscores the resilient nature of the stock's price movement during the correction phase.  The stock has recently shown a breakout of the Symmetrical Triangle pattern which indicates continuation of prior uptrend.  The prices have sustained well above its key moving averages of 50, 100 &amp;amp; 200-day EMA which confirms the presence of prior uptrend. Additionally, the RSI (relative strength index) on the daily timeframe has shown a breakout too which reflect presence of strong momentum.  Going ahead we expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 2,500 where the stop-loss must be Rs 2,140 on the closing basis.    Varun Beverages: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,454 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390 | Target: Rs 1,650 | Return: 13 percent  The stock price of VBL is currently trading near its life-high which tells that the stock already is in strong momentum. The recent breakout of the Rounding Bottom pattern confirms continuation of the prior uptrend.  On the daily timeframe, the stock has been consistently trading near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating increased volatility. Additionally, the RSI on the Daily timeframe has shown a breakout too which reflect presence of strong momentum.  In conclusion, based on these technical indicators, it is anticipated that the stock will continue to rise towards Rs 1,650 level with a suggested stop-loss at Rs 1,390 on a closing basis.

lt,2023-03-29T16:56:25+05:30,Rachita Prasad,"Aim to keep debt, interest costs under check despite high interest rate environment: L&amp;T CFO  ","In the interview with Moneycontrol, Raman spoke about global factors influencing business, his expectations of the Indian central bank and how L&amp;T is navigating the high interest rate environment.  ","Engineering and construction giant Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T) is working to maintain its long-term debt levels and keep its interest costs under check in a rising interest rate environment, Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman told Moneycontrol.  Raman’s comments followed L&amp;amp;T’s Rs 2,000-crore bond sale earlier this week, its first after three years.  Raman said the company’s strategy will be to be focus on businesses that are financed by working capital – money available for current obligations -- and will not entail any major fresh capital expenditure. A deviation in this strategy could be its planned capital expenditure in green energy, but that too may be financed by value unlocking in other businesses and may not lead to an increase in debt.  In the interview, Raman spoke about global factors influencing business, his expectations of the Indian central bank and how L&amp;amp;T is navigating the high interest rate environment. Edited excerpts:  Q: L&amp;amp;T has raised Rs 2,000 crore through a bond issue earlier this week. The company hit the bond market after a gap of three years. What’s the rationale behind the timing?  A: We have some normal bonds that are coming up for maturity. So this will be used for refinancing. There is nothing very strategic about the timing, it’s a routine transaction.  Q: The coupon rate for the bonds was fixed at 7.725 percent. How different is the rate from the earlier bonds that it will be refinancing?  A: I don't think it is substantially different; around plus or minus 10-20 basis points (One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point). What is relevant to me is the rate that we are paying is appropriate in the current times. The short term paper is going at 7.3- 7.4 percent. Long-term, five-year paper is at 7.5-7.6 percent. What we have done doesn't seem to be off-key; it is good for the current times.  Q: How much of your debt have you refinanced in fiscal 2022-23?  A: There was some smaller amount which came up earlier in this year for refinancing. All put together, the total refinancing done is around Rs 2,000 crore-3,000 crore.  Q: What’s the total debt on L&amp;amp;T’s books? What will be the average cost of debt after this bond issue?  A: Funds raised through this bond will substitute maturing debt so the debt-equity ratio doesn't change for L&amp;amp;T’s standalone books. We had around Rs 20,000 crore debt in our balance sheet and it will continue to be around that. The weighted average cost of funding must be around 7 percent and thereabouts. We don't borrow much. We’re an AAA company so we get the best of rates.  Q: The recent amendment to the Finance Bill takes away long term tax benefits from debt mutual funds. There is a general concern that this may weaken demand for longer duration corporate bonds and impact the cost of raising funds. What is your assessment?  A: People will now get used to the fact that the yields on debt funds are going to be taxed as any other interest income. So my sense is that it's just a transitory because money has to find safe places to be employed, and people who need money for worthwhile purposes will continue to seek money. There may be some amount of price readjustments that will happen because an investor would have possibly factored indexation benefit or long-term capital benefit when he subscribed to a mutual fund. And the mutual fund, in turn, subscribes to all these corporate bonds, etc, as we still don't have direct retail subscription to corporate bonds of  significant magnitude. So the mutual funds will possibly have to rejig their schemes.  There are several numbers that are being quoted about the volume of debt funds that will move either to equity or to any other scheme. Most of the retail investors, I guess, will move towards bank deposits in the interim. But the institutional investors won't go towards bank deposits because the money that they normally invest is short term. So it'll be mostly in liquid funds, and maybe some may put it into income funds. Ultimately, the mutual funds will start gathering the institutional surplus in alternative schemes, which will find its way to the corporate bonds.  Q: Will L&amp;amp;T review its strategy for its own treasury operations in view of these changes?  A: Most of our investments are all for a very short term because we only invest working capital surplus. Any long-term surplus that we have goes into businesses directly, not into treasury investments. So to that extent, we were never a candidate for long-term capital gains through these investments. I think, for most corporates, it will not really change the dynamics of their investment pattern.  Q: After L&amp;amp;T announced financial results for nine months ended December, it said in a presentation to analysts that savings due to Hyderabad Metro refinancing was partly offset by higher finance costs at the parent. What kind of impact are we talking about?  A: For the nine-month period, our interest costs have gone down contrary to the trend of interest rate movements. Our Hyderabad Metro project, which had raised construction financing from banks at a higher rate, post-construction, was able to repay all the bank loans with market borrowings through bonds. The cost of these bonds was less and since Hyderabad Metro had almost Rs 8,000 crore - Rs 9,000 crore of construction loans refinanced, the impact of that interest cost saving was moderating our overall interest rates even though interest costs of working capital etc. had actually gone up.  Q: We are almost at the end of FY23, with all the refinancing done so far at the company level and at Hyderabad Metro projects. Will there be any significant change in the interest cost in the next few quarters?  A: No, in fact, hopefully, through the next few quarters, we would try to repay some of the loans in our Hyderabad Metro project. So I would expect the interest rate to come down. The state government has sanctioned Rs 3,000 crore (as soft loans), we’ll repay the debt in installments. We also have some of the land parcels and property as a part of Hyderabad Metro which will be sold and the proceeds will also go to reduce the debt.  Q: The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee will meet next week. There is an expectation that they may announce another increase of 25 basis points. What is your expectation?  A: There is talk of a 25 basis point increase but to my mind, rates are almost peaking. It could be anywhere between leaving it unchanged or increasing it by 25 basis points. I'm not privy to the factors they will consider to decide. But my sense is, it is not likely to go up by 50 basis points. They may pause, wait for things to show up a little more data-wise, and then do one more correction. Because if they fire the bullet now, in terms of the (rate) raise, then they will be out of any ammunition going forward. Unless something dramatically happens and you know, inflation goes to 10 percent, which I don't see to be the case.  Q: What about global factors? The Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis caused some alarm, and assessment of systemic risks. How are you assessing the situation right now?  It only brought out the old asset-liability management issue, which is not something which is systemically unknown. I was also surprised by the swiftness with which things were taken control of; depositors did not lose money. Those who are banking with the bank did not suffer big losses. There was no run on the bank and affairs were controlled. The remedial measures, despite it being one of the larger banks, were very effective. I think today, if we were to talk to people in the US, I think they've gone past SVB.  Q: Last year, SN Subrahmanyan (SNS), chief executive officer and managing director of L&amp;amp;T, said that the company aims to be zero-debt by end-FY23, a goal you have also reiterated before. By when do you think you could reach that level?  A: In my mind, ‘zero debt’ is not nil debt. It just means that there is enough liquidity in the balance sheet to be able to pay off all the debt if push comes to shove. If you see the balance sheet that we put out in September, for the Rs 20,000 crore of debt that we had in our standalone balance sheet, we had almost Rs 20,000 crore worth of treasury investments. To that extent, I'm treating that as zero debt even though technically there is Rs 20,000 crore debt on the balance sheet. So when SNS or I speak about zero debt, we mean that we don't want to be, at a net level, excessively geared because our business is working-capital-intensive, we are moving away from capital-intensive ventures. We are in the process of unwinding all of those past assets that we built up. Whatever cash we will unlock, we have to pay it back to the providers of capital, be it debt capital or equity capital. I think if the business is going to move towards just working-capital-intensive business, those are financed by guarantees and credit lines. There is no need for any real long-term debt and we are not really looking for any major investments at this point in time other than that in green energy.  Q: There has been a slight shift in your ‘asset light’ strategy as L&amp;amp;T plans to invest in green energy now. What will be the capital expenditure for that?  A: We have factories already with us, we'll have to maybe invest in some equipment to get the new venture going. We're not looking at it as any major investment. Normally, we spend Rs 2,000 crore-Rs 3,000 crore on capex every year, maybe we will end up spending another Rs 1,500 crore- Rs 2,000 crore for green energy over a two-year period. We are doing enough to unlock capital already and should be able to finance all of this. I don't expect the net debt level to go up because of all of this programme.  Q: Traditionally, the fourth quarter is the strongest for L&amp;amp;T in terms of revenue and orders. How has the performance been?  A: I wouldn’t comment on this during the result season.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/aim-to-keep-debt-interest-costs-under-check-despite-high-interest-rate-environment-lt-cfo-10332501.html

Green Hydrogen production capacity in India is estimated to grow to at least 5 MMTPA by 2030 in line with the nation’s Green Hydrogen Mission, which would call for investments upward of $100 billion. The EPC major believes India is well suited for Green Hydrogen production due to the low generation costs of renewable electricity from abundantly available solar PV and wind power sources.  The country aims to be among the world’s largest Green Hydrogen hubs.  Sharekhan by BNP Paribas is of the view that focusing on sunrise sectors such as green hydrogen, data centres, e-commerce as well as defence would lead to further diversification. The brokerage firm believes that L&amp;amp;T by virtue of its leadership and diversified offerings in the EPC domain would be a key beneficiary of the government’s infrastructure thrust and capex revival in private sectors. Further, increased investments in infrastructure and hydrocarbon will provide diverse opportunities.

Tabreed is eyeing airports and nearby aero cities for its products, he said.  Green buildings, which companies and real estate developers are already looking at, are also an opportunity for district cooling companies including Tabreed India.  District cooling is a system widely used overseas where chilled water produced in a central plant is supplied to buildings through a network of insulated pipes.  Perla said in most public sector projects in India, there are many players involved in designing, planning, and executing a project and it becomes difficult to coordinate and get approvals.  “Most public sector projects in India are funded by one party, planned and designed by another, and executed by a third party. So it becomes hard for us to coordinate with so many departments and ministries,” Perla said.  He said the coordination between ministries and stakeholders prevented Tabreed India from participating in tenders to provide cooling systems for metro projects and the Central Vista project.  The new parliament is being built by Tata Project; three out of 10 buildings that will form the Common Central Secretariat (CCS) are being built by Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro; and the vice-president’s enclave is being developed by Jharkhand-based Kamladityya Construction.  First few deals  Perla added that Tabreed India had entered into a 30-year concession with the Andhra Pradesh government in 2019 to build, own, operate and transfer India's first district cooling system in the state's proposed new capital Amaravati, but the project is on hold.  However, Tabreed India is confident about growth and is finalising its first deal.  “We are in the process of finalising a deal to set up a district cooling system of 6,000 to 10,000 refrigeration tonne capacity. We hope to finalise the deal in the next few weeks,” Perla said.  Tabreed India is also in advanced negotiations to set up district cooling systems in four to five other projects in Hyderabad, Pune, and Bengaluru. “By July, we'll have at least four or five fairly interesting, large enough partnerships in India,” Perla said.  Perla said that to promote the growth of district cooling systems in India, the government can address some bottlenecks. He said the government should consider lowering the goods and services tax rate on district cooling systems to make them more affordable.  He added that the system of power tariff slabs in residential properties lowers the savings district cooling systems can provide to individuals.  District cooling systems also make use of natural sources of water such as lakes, rivers, and seawater to exchange heat, enabling the provision of “free cooling,” substantially decreasing power consumption.  The main advantage of district cooling is that it leverages economies of scale by aggregating demand, eliminating the need for independent AC units for buildings. This reduces capex requirements and the need to build for peak cooling capacity.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tabreed-india-to-focus-on-cooling-systems-for-commercial-property-10175361.html

Solar and hydro power projects, power transmission and distribution, green buildings, water and resource conservation, solid waste management and emission reduction through building mass rapid transport systems are a part of the same.  Announced order inflows for the quarter so far includes large and mega contracts from high-speed rail, metals and mining segment, said Kotak Institutional Equities.  The announced order inflow for L&amp;amp;T for the December quarter has so far remained below expectations of Kotak Institutional Equities, but the announcements do not include orders where negotiations are still ongoing with clients, the brokerage firm pointed out.  “Our 3QFY23 order flow expectation is Rs 544 billion, which is 8 percent YoY growth for L&amp;amp;T,” Jefferies said. It added that the FY23 order flow should comfortably end the year at the management’s guidance range of 12-15 percent YoY based on this trend.  “During Q3FY23, EPC order inflows announced by L&amp;amp;T are in the range of around Rs 20,500-34,000 crore (as on date, ex-services segment) across railway, hydrocarbon, power T&amp;amp;D (transmission and distribution), water treatment, heavy engineering, buildings and factories segments indicating strong order inflows for the quarter amid a challenging environment,” ICICI Securities said.  As order flow and execution outlook remain healthy, L&amp;amp;T could see an additional re-rating on the ESG leg if more funds get an exemption, according to Jefferies, which added that rerating should also be driven by peak of non-core investments being behind and better capital allocation.  Talking about the operational performance, Kotak Institutional Equities said that EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortisation) margin will start reflecting the recent moderation in commodity prices.  Even Sharekhan is of the view that the engineering major’s margin will witness a marginal increase, both on-year and on-quarter, due to operating leverage and lower input cost.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, Veliyath explained his stance and said he would prefer companies in the secondary market and doesn’t see deep value in new-age companies such as Paytm and Nykaa. Excerpts from the interview:  Any stock in 2022 that you regret holding or selling?   When we do smallcap investing, mistakes are bound to happen. That's why there is more risk and more return in that strategy and we are still doing it, even though we have some large midcaps and largecaps sometimes. We don't regret anything.  One stock you were better off not holding in 2022   Everything was good in 2022, to be very frank. Raymond is the stock I'm very proud of… I still like this business. It is valued at around Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 11,000 crore. I bought this stock only because of this high valuation.  Manyavar was planning an issue at Rs 20,000 crore valuation… I think today it is around Rs 32,000 crore. So, Manyavar is not bad. Even those who bought it later are making money. But when I compare it with Raymond, I would prefer Raymond, even today, on a valuation basis and the potential for future wealth creation.  Staying on IPOs – Mamaearth and OYO. Which is better between the two   Neither. I think it's risky. Would rather look at the secondary market, listed companies.  Is Nykaa going the Paytm way? It’s almost 67 percent lower from its high. In the same category, are there any other stocks that would be risky?   I’m not knowledgeable enough to, you know, analyse these two companies or make a comparison. I know generally what they're doing. But valuation-wise, both the companies are well-priced today, I would say. I don't see any deep value in them. Maybe equal in that aspect.  What about the less-risky bets in that category?   Tata Communication is a technology company. They have been into voice and data infrastructure. It is my second-largest holding in portfolio management. So, I would prefer this compared to some of these technology companies coming out with IPOs. This looks safer to me.  But investors should be careful before investing. I'm not making a recommendation. We have been buying this stock for the last two or three years and are very comfortable. We continue to hold. It looks like a safe bet among technology, among new-gen businesses.  Other than their legacy business, Tata Communication is venturing into all the new-gen futuristic technology businesses/solutions, global solutions. I think this is a stock to watch and investors should be exploring it further.  Of these three themes – defence, infrastructure, and railways – which looks interesting to you?   Infra is more interesting. Defence, of course, already had a big run on a comparison and on a valuation basis. Some of the infrastructure companies, many fund managers have been talking about it, many mutual fund managers are buying. So, I think they have been suffering in the last 10-15 years and people were selling off those companies, and some of them are available at very reasonable, attractive valuations. And we are talking about huge capex, private and public, in infrastructure… I feel infrastructure is preferred among the three at current evaluation.  Within infra, what's your preferred segment?    Infra in general. Actually, we don't have super-specialised large infra companies. Now Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro is doing everything… We have a holding in Jai Kumar. It has always been at low valuation because of the perception in the market. But they're doing a good job. I think it’s a significantly large company with a strong balance sheet.  If not a wealth manager, what would have been your career choice?  I am a half-farmer right now. So I would have been a full-time farmer. I love farming and I spend a lot of time on that.  What's your stress buster? Farming, again. Yeah. I live in Cochin. And after a decade of my career in Mumbai, I left the city in 1999. And you go for the weekend to the village, where your birthplace is, your native place. So that kind of lifestyle is so relaxing in today's busy world. I'm enjoying it and that's really a stress buster. I do work on my farm.  How about your market guru?   Chandrakant Sampat used to be my market guru. I had the privilege to interact with him… I have had more interaction with him since 1993 when I joined Parag Parikh Financial Services. It was Parag Parikh Securities then. So, he used to be in the office every day. He would talk to me about Nestle, Indian Shaving Products, which is today's Gillette, and Colgate. He used to make me buy shares for him. I used to go to the trading ring in those days, representing Parag Parikh.  I learned a lot from him, but I used to disagree with him in a big way because I had a gambler's mind. A little trading kind of mind. I used to enjoy it… I get a kick out of doing speculative trade. I love that. I still do it.  Given your love for speculative trading, is value investing your strategy, or is it growth investing?   Value investing. I strongly believe in that. That basic discipline of investing is required. When I talk about trading or speculative trade, it's one aspect of my life. But our focus as an organisation [is to] create [wealth] through the bottom-up approach, identify smart companies which can grow very big in the future, which can be multibaggers. So the structure of the Indian economy is… helping that kind of investment strategy. So we believe and we continue with that kind of value investing strategy.  Three stock ideas that you'd like to recommend   My top three holdings in the equity intelligence portfolio are Raymond first, Tata Communications and Hindware. So, we still believe in this story and these are our holdings. We may sell at some point of time. So there is no point in investors just betting on these three companies as it is, but explore, study about the valuation…  If there is a company which is perfect, wonderful promoter, highly ethical – like a Narayana Murthy kind of a promoter – and excellent industry, everything is fine, it's going to be big growth… then I will not invest in that company. Because then that stock will be already priced to that level and there is no fun in doing it.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/this-wealth-manager-finds-planned-ipos-of-mamaearth-oyo-risky-propositions-9930051.html

It has been trading well below all long term moving averages for more than a month now, though it closed above 9 DEMA for the first time in current month.  Here's what Rohan Patil of SAMCO Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  IIFL Finance  IIFL Finance prices on the daily scale were trading in a smaller consolidation range from past 15 days and were facing a strong resistance near Rs 485 levels. On Tuesday, we witnessed a strong spurt in the prices which resulted in a consolidation breakout above Rs 485 level.  Technically, the bullish crossover of 9 EMA over 21 EMA is known as the golden cross – the medium-term bullish trend is spotted on the daily time frame. The counter is trending above the golden cross and the retest offers the low risk – high reward entry.  One can initiate a buy at CMP Rs 514.75 and more at dips near Rs 504 with an upside target of Rs 545 in next 1-3 months. Investors should strictly follow the stop-loss of Rs 483.    Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro  L&amp;amp;T on the daily time frame is trading in a higher high higher bottom formation within the rising channel pattern, which confirms the bullish trend in the counter.  As can be seen in the chart prices have given a smaller degree horizontal trend line breakout within the rising channel pattern after a consolidation.  The recent breakout is confirmed with higher volumes and previously such robust volume activity was witnessed on November 1, 2022. By analysing the above volume pattern, we can understand that prices normally move higher with a steady pace post price volume breakout.

L&amp;amp;T, along with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CIPPB), signed a pact with Infrastructure Yield Plus, a platform backed by Edelweiss Alternatives, for the sale of L&amp;amp;T IDPL for an enterprise value of around Rs 6,000 crore.  L&amp;amp;T has adopted an asset-light strategy, which entails exiting some non-core businesses like IDPL.  In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad, Sen shared his plans for the other two divestment targets of the company — the Hyderabad metro project and Nabha Power. Sen said that L&amp;amp;T will invest in developing projects in new segments. Edited excerpts of the interview follow:  Industry expectation of the IDPL deal size varied from Rs 4,000-7,000 crore. Please explain how you arrived at an enterprise value of Rs 6,000 crore? What profit will L&amp;amp;T make on this deal?   We built this asset portfolio over 20 years. We have been pioneers in developing an infrastructure investment model. We went on executing one project after another as the industry and the government wanted private developers to come into the sector.  In this process, we developed about 15 roads and one concession-based transmission line project. We have already divested some other projects.  CPPIB invested in L&amp;amp;T IDPL and has over the years increased its stake to 49 percent. The cash component of the deal, before closing adjustments, is Rs 2,723 crore which will be shared between CPPIB and L&amp;amp;T, while the debt and other liabilities will remain with IDPL.  I will not disclose the amount but L&amp;amp;T will make a profit on this divestment. L&amp;amp;T and our partner CPPIB had stopped investing in new projects in the last 3-4 years, but the business has great credentials in roads, railways, high-speed transport, and other infrastructure segments. The new owner is keen to grow its portfolio, which gives us the confidence that this asset will do well with them.  L&amp;amp;T has plans to exit development projects and be asset-light. Does this deal mean that L&amp;amp;T will no longer look at infrastructure projects as a developer and only be a contractor?   We want to have an asset-light structure but we have also been announcing investments in new-age assets. We are exiting non-core assets and do not have any plans to invest in fossil fuel-based projects, road infrastructure, or any other concession-based infrastructure projects, in the near future. We will be investing in data centres, green hydrogen, and other new-age businesses like startups in the e-commerce space.  These news businesses are currently supervised under the corporate strategy group but once they gain scale and shape, there will be some kind of reorganization within the group.  What about L&amp;amp;T Hyderabad Metro and Nabha Power Ltd? Would the divestment of these assets be possible by March?   We are financially restructuring L&amp;amp;T Hyderabad Metro  and making sure that we reduce the debt substantially to make it viable and profitable, apart from taking various strategic initiatives to increase revenue and make it attractive for investors, and then pare our stake gradually.  As for Nabha, we are looking to get better valuations. Nabha has been a very good and self-sustainable asset for us. It is one of the best power plants in the industry with high plant availability, high plant load, efficiency, etc. We are in discussions with a few parties and as part of the process, we have already refinanced the L&amp;amp;T-guaranteed NCDs and commercial papers as a commercial loan.  You have been in talks with the state government to reduce the debt burden of L&amp;amp;T Hyderabad Metro. What is the situation there?  We had debt of over Rs 13,000 crore in the project. We were incurring losses and it came to a stage that we would have had to close it unless we received some help from the government. We requested the government to help us with long-term soft loans, which they agreed to in lieu of the claims from project delays (due to issues at the government’s end) after long deliberations, considering that the public is the biggest beneficiary of the project.  With the help of a government loan of Rs 3,000 crore, along with real estate and TOD (transit-oriented development) monetisation proceeds of Rs 2,000 crore, we will reduce the debt to Rs 8,000 crore. We are also in advanced talks with some private equity companies for around Rs 2,000-3000 crore of equity investment in the project.  Also, the entire debt, which comprised commercial loans, has been restructured as L&amp;amp;T-guaranteed bonds. This has reduced the interest substantially, from about 9.5 percent to 6.5 percent, reducing the cash outgo. We also expect the traffic to go up to over 5.5 lakh passengers per day from 4.5 lakh now.  With the coming together of all these factors, we hope to make this asset self-sustaining. We hope to reach zero-loss levels by the end of next year or by FY25.  What will be the loss from L&amp;amp;T Hyderabad Metro in FY23?   We have already factored that in our quarterly financials. I think it should be around Rs 900 crore this year, which is much lower than the Rs 1,800 crore annual loss seen over the past couple of years.  India needs to spend about $1.4 trillion to emerge as a $5 trillion economy by FY25. For this, public sector investment alone will not be enough. But there aren't too many private sector companies who have the appetite for public-private partnership (PPP) projects.  To make things worse, we are staring at high interest rates. What can the government do to encourage private sector participation in infrastructure?  I have been speaking at various industry forums and have spoken to the ministry. This is a problem that the government has to solve. If you see the NIP (National Infrastructure Pipeline), out of the planned investment of Rs 111 lakh crore, roughly Rs 25 lakh crore of the capex will come from private companies.  Private companies have shown lukewarm response. There are a whole lot of problems, some of which have been solved by the government but some are yet to be.  The government has already announced correct policies for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and arbitration, among others, but now they need to be actualised. Programmes like the Pradhan Mantri Gati Shakti (PMGS) scheme are very good — the fact that the government will address everything on one platform is helpful. But frankly, a lot needs to be done to ensure we hit the road running. Private companies have the money, but they are investing in projects where there's no risk of construction. The government needs to solve the problems and ensure that revenue risks are addressed.  The upcoming budget would be the last budget of the current dispensation. Do you expect any major announcements for the infrastructure sector?  Of the Rs 7.5 lakh crore capex to be spent by the government, around Rs 4 lakh crore was already spent by November and the rest may be consumed in the remaining months  of the current fiscal. Nowadays, the government is inviting bids for assets after 100 percent land acquisition is done. That's a good thing.  But at the state level, another Rs 7.5 lakh crore worth of projects was supposed to be initiated, but only Rs 2 lakh crore has been spent as of Nov '22. That's a big area where the government has to really see how it can help the state government raise funds.  States must be incentivised for transit-oriented development or other projects to encourage them to put in more money and generate money. (Transit-oriented development aims to concentrate jobs, housing, and services around public transport stations.)  The centre has done a good job monetising assets, and they can help states to do the same. The budget must look at ways to encourage states to invest money in infrastructure and incentivise the private sector to come back to development projects. Some states are doing a good job, but there could be better coordination between the centre and other states.  The government has prioritised infra spending after the pandemic and come out with policies with the right intent. We hope public capex will be hiked to Rs 10 Lakh crore in this year’s budget.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/idpl-sale-profitable-hyderabad-metro-will-break-even-by-fy25-lt-development-projects-head-9731981.html

There was also a breakout of long, slightly downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining October 19, 2021 and November 25, 2022. On a weekly basis, it has consistently maintained higher high formation for seventh consecutive week.  The momentum is in favour of bulls but having consistent run-up for the last few days, there could be some bouts of volatility and consolidation can be seen in coming sessions, before taking gradual march towards 18,700-19,000, with immediate support at 18,500 and crucial support at 18,300-18,000 levels, experts said.  &quot;We expect the Nifty to gradually march towards 19,000 mark, as the overall trend remains positive. Participation of the broader market further adds strength to the market,&quot; Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.  However, intermittent volatility cannot be ruled out on account of global worries, he feels.  The Nifty has shown real resilience and has outperformed by a big margin point to point. This has given a rise in probability that the index may touch the extrapolated levels of 19,600 (2,800 points mirror from the recent bottom at 16,800), Pushkaraj Kanitkar, VP Equities at GEPL Capital, said. &quot;The view would be negated only below the level of 17,800.&quot;  Here are top 10 stock ideas by experts that can participate in the Nifty's journey towards the 19,000 mark:  Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi  PVR: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,867 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,795 | Target: Rs 2,000 | Return: 7 percent  Since the last 3 trading sessions, the counter has witnessed nice buying interest along with volume picking up complementing the up move. At the current juncture, PVR has taken support at 200 DEMA (days exponential moving average) high low band along with pair of Doji candlesticks structure.  Recently PVR has taken out its previous swing high of Rs 1,858 and has closed near the Rs 1,867 mark in its previous trading session.  On the indicator front, price ROC (rate of change) 21 days is well placed above the zero line around 8 levels along with daily MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) giving a bullish cross exactly above the zero line thus hinting towards Rs 2,000 levels in a month's time.  Plausible support is expected around Rs 1,795. One can buy in small tranches between Rs 1,860-1,870 and another at Rs 1,830 levels (if tested again).    Aditya Birla Fashion &amp;amp; Retail: Buy | LTP: Rs 312 | Stop-Loss: Rs 290 | Target: Rs 340 | Return: 9 percent  The fall which started from November 1, 2022 till November 18, 2022 resulted in a 17 percent cut in price from the high of Rs 360. At the current juncture, the said counter is taking support near Rs 300 levels.  On an hourly scale, it has given a bullish crossover in the directional movement index along with an hourly MACD bullish cross thus confirming an upside in the counter. One can buy with an upside target of Rs 340 with a stop-loss of Rs 290.    Tinplate Company of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 312 | Stop-Loss: Rs 290 | Target: Rs 350 | Return: 12 percent  Tinplate has corrected almost 34 percent from its top of Rs 438 which was registered on April 13, 2022. On a weekly scale, it has taken support near its previous historical support zone Rs 290-300.  In the last 4 months, it has made a nice base near Rs 300 levels. Recently on a daily scale, the stock confirmed a bullish Hammer candlestick pattern exactly at 200 DEMA high low band and that is adding more confirmation of further upside in the counter.  In addition to the above-discussed technical reasoning, weekly RSI (relative strength index) has nicely bounced back from Rs 40 levels which is adding more strength to the said counter. Thus we advise traders to buy the stock for an upside target of Rs 350 with a stop-loss of Rs 290.    Expert: Kunal Shah, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities  Reliance Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,707.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600 | Target: Rs 2,800-2,920 | Return: 8 percent  The stock has given a strong breakout on the daily chart from a falling trend line with a sharp surge in volumes. The momentum indicator RSI has given a positive crossover on the daily chart which confirms the buy signal.  The stock bounced back sharply from its 200 EMA which is placed at Rs 2,500 level.    Nippon Life India: Buy | LTP: Rs 269.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 260 | Target: Rs 285-290 | Return: 7.5 percent  The stock for the past couple of months had witnessed a sharp correction with lower high lower low formations. The stock is now witnessing a bottom formation on the daily chart with a sharp surge in volumes.  A positive divergence is visible on the daily chart which confirms the buy signal. The MACD indicator has also turned bullish with a positive crossover at the zero line confirming the change in trend.  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,064.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,950 | Target: Rs 2,200-2,240 | Return: 8.5 percent  The stock is trading in a strong uptrend with higher top and higher bottom formations on all the time frames. The momentum indicator RSI has entered the zone of 60 which confirms the strength of the stock.  The stock is trading well above its short-term moving average which will act as support. The lower-end support zone Rs 1,980-1,950 will act as a cushion for the bulls and the upside visible targets are Rs 2,200-2,240.    Expert: Pushkaraj Kanitkar, VP Equities at GEPL Capital  Sun Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,034.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 925 | Target: Rs 1,200 | Return: 16 percent  Although belonging to the laggard sector (pharma and healthcare), Sun Pharma has remained a consistent performer right from the March 2020 lows. Rising in a rational uptrend, the stock is in striking distance of all-time highs created in 2015 around the level of Rs 1,200.  The momentum in the stock seems pretty strong and hence we have seen strong outperformance with respect to the peers in the sector (Sun Pharma has moved up contrary to downmove in Nifty PHARMA Index.).  Immediate targets are placed at Rs 1,200 while negation of the view would happen below the level of Rs 925 (25-week DMA).    State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 608.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 540 | Target: Rs 820 | Return: 35 percent  The stock belongs not just to the outperforming sector (Bank Nifty has created all-time highs way before the Nifty), but intrinsically has been outperformer within the sector (both private &amp;amp; PSU banks).  The prices created fresh highs although the heavyweights within the index like HDFC Bank (private) or Bank of Baroda, or Canara Bank (PSU banks) are still off the all-time highs.  The outperformance will open up price projection of patterns to around Rs 820, while the view will get negated below Rs 540, which was the level of earlier highs with multiple touch points.    Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,064.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,800 | Target: Rs 2,350 | Return: 14 percent  In sync with the price movement since October 2021, we have seen L&amp;amp;T too touch new highs recently. In the process it has remained a strong contender for the leadership within the Nifty50.  Technically it has formed a continuation pattern in the form of Cup &amp;amp; Handle pattern. The price projection for the pattern points to levels of Rs 2350, which also happens to be the extrapolation from the recent swing low of Rs 1,800.  We stand bullish on the same with negation only below the swing low.    Expert: Rajesh Palviya, Vice President - Research (Head Technical &amp;amp; Derivatives) at Axis Securities  State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 608.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 590 | Target: Rs 660-690 | Return: 13 percent  The stock is in a strong up trend forming a series of higher tops and bottoms across all the time frame. The stock is strongly placed above all its 20, 50, 100 and 200-day SMAs (simple moving average), and these averages are also inching upward along with rising prices. This signifies a strong up trend.  The daily, weekly, monthly relative strength indicator RSI is also placed positively representing sustained uptrend. In the weekly time frame, the stock managed to hold its prior breakout zone of Rs 560 levels which remains a positive sign.  Traders and investors are advised to add, and hold with expected upside of Rs 660-690 levels. An immediate support zone is around Rs 590 and major support zone Rs 570 levels.  Reliance Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,707.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,500 | Target: Rs 2,900-3,000 | Return: 11 percent  Since September 2021, the stock has been consolidating within broad trading range Rs 2,800-2,200 levels indicating strong accumulation. However on the monthly charts, the stock is in a strong uptrend forming a series of higher tops and bottoms  With current close, the stock has decisively broken out its &quot;descending triangle&quot; at Rs 2,640 levels. This breakout is accompanied with huge volumes indicating increased participation. The stock has recaptured its 20, 50, 100 and 200-day SMA and rebounded sharply. The daily and weekly RSI is placed positively, which supports rising strength.  Traders and investors are advised to add, and hold with expected upside of Rs 2,900-3,000 levels. An immediate support zone is around Rs 2,500 and major support zone Rs 2,350 levels.  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,064.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,960 | Target: Rs 2,300-2,350 | Return: 14 percent  The stock is in strong uptrend across all time frames and registered a new all-time frame at Rs 2,095 levels. This represents bullish sentiments. On the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed &quot;V&quot; shape breakout at Rs 2,044 levels indicating continuation of uptrend.  The stock is strongly placed above all its 20, 50, 100 and 200 day SMAs, and these averages are also inching upward along with rising prices.  The daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly RSI is placed positively indicating sustained strength across all the time frames.  Traders and investors are advised to add, and hold with expected upside of Rs 2,300-2,350 levels. An immediate support zone is around Rs 1,960 and major support zone Rs 1,800 levels.

How strong the real economy is will get reflected in the banking system as well, said Dinesh Khara, the SBI Chairman, at the 9th SBI Banking &amp;amp; Economics Conclave.  CNBC-TV18's Shereen Bhan spoke to the panellists at the event about the road ahead for the Indian economy. Besides Khara, the panel comprised L&amp;amp;T CFO Shankar Raman; Managing Director of Crisil Ratings Gurpreet Chhatwal; CEO of Technocrat Navneet Kumar Saraf; Joint MD of JSW Steel Seshagiri Rao; and Founder and CEO of Jupiter Jitendra Gupta.  Khara said in the current fiscal year, India is standing as the brightest star across the globe and the same is being replicated in the performance of the banking sector.  Chhatwal spoke about the bond market, which has been a bit of a challenge for the last 18 months. &quot;Today, banks are doing the heavy lifting, we are creating building blocks within the bond market for that growth,&quot; he said, adding that the bond markets have matured significantly in terms of investors that are coming in, the quality of paper that is coming in, the infrastructure financials, etc.  Raman said India is in a unique place in terms of growth. &quot;We went through the turmoils of the last two years rather well. That has given us a sense of self belief,&quot; he said. Everyone believes that India is in a good position to dream about its aspirations over the next 25 years, he added. &quot;The name Amrit Kaal is fitting because it does say how we feel about India,&quot; he said.  Saraf and Rao spoke about India's role as manufacturers. Rao said this is the first time the manufacturing sector is being used to its hilt —it is at a three-year high. &quot;When the manufacturing sector is creating capacity in India, it is not only for India it is also for export markets,&quot; he said, adding that when countries across the globe are concerned about recession, India is growing at the rate of 6-7 percent.  Saraf said for India to achieve its target of $5-trillion GDP in the next three years, export competitiveness would play an important role. &quot;With the China + 1 policy that is prevalent, I think it is a great opportunity for India to expand manufacturing exports,&quot; he said, adding that better availability of raw material would help.  Gupta said for India to cross $40 trillion by 2024, support from non-linear growth (internet economy) is just as important compared to linear growth (infrastructure, exports, manufacturing, etc).

The Nifty50 has taken a good support at 18,200 and nicely defended 18,300 mark after moving higher close to 18,450 levels during the last week.  Hence, breaching either side of this range can give some kind of direction to the market in coming days, but having a monthly expiry and FOMC minutes scheduled in current week, the volatility and consolidation is at the fore before any kind of big move on either side of range, experts said.  The Nifty50 snapped its four-week winning streak and fell 42 points to close the week at 18,308, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices corrected 1.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively.  &quot;The structure remains upbeat. As far as levels are concerned, the bullish gap of 18,100-18,250 is likely to provide a cushion to any intra-week blip, and it is highly anticipated that the dip would augur well for the bulls,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.  On the flip side, 18,450-18,500 is a significant hurdle for the bulls, and any decisive breach above the same could only trigger a fresh round of rally in the market.  The market awaits some trigger points to have an upsurge, and in the meantime, the index is expected to remain in the mentioned range, Sameet feels.  &quot;We remain sanguine with the uptrend and would advocate the traders to utilize the dips to add long position in the index,&quot; said the market expert who expects some interesting moves to unfold in a larger pool of stocks, which is likely to provide better opportunities for momentum traders.

lt,2022-11-02T13:15:13+05:30,Dipti Sharma,"Guarded commentary already discounted in L&amp;T, buyback could re-rate stock","Most brokerage firms have baked in weak profitability for the infrastructure player along with gradual margin recovery. However, a buyback is yet to be factored in and there could be another leg of re-rating in case of any buyback announcement, said an analyst from foreign brokerage firm. ","After a rock-solid earnings performance by Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T), investors are like a cat on hot bricks. The nervousness in the market is largely because of the guarded commentary from the management.  Most brokerage firms have baked in weak profitability for the infrastructure player along with a gradual margin recovery. Additionally, a rating downgrade on L&amp;amp;T shares by Kotak Institutional Equities to ‘add’ from ‘buy’ also made investors somewhat jittery.  The stock movement since its Q2 result has been a bit lacklustre with the scrip oscillating between losses and gains. However, a section of the market buyback is yet to be factored in, said an analyst at a foreign brokerage firm. He added that there could be another leg of re-rating in case of a buyback announcement.  The company, in a post-earnings conference call, had said that at the start of the next financial year, return on equity would improve to 18 percent from 11 percent thanks to metro projects in various cities, divestments and consistent margins and growth. It added that buyback is definitely being talked about in the group.  A buyback would reduce the assets on its balance sheet which implies that return on assets would increase because assets are reduced and return on equity would also improve because there is less outstanding equity.  On the profitability front, the management said margins in the first half of FY23 are lower than in the first half of FY22. But it believes softening of commodity prices and revenue uptick in the second half of FY23 will help improve margins on an annualised basis. However, supply chain issues among other challenges can have an impact on margins but it will still be near the company’s provided guidance, it added.  L&amp;amp;T has remained cautious for its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margin guidance of around 9.5 percent for FY23, owing to supply chain issues and higher input costs.  Given healthy order prospects and order book, the management has maintained its revenue and order inflow guidance of 12-15 percent.  Read here | Daily Voice | A 25-50bps hike possible in tomorrow's off-cycle MPC meet, says this market veteran  Even as revenue and order inflow guidance has been retained for FY23, Nomura said it appears conservative against present trends. “L&amp;amp;T reported strong order inflows of Rs 519 billion (+107% y-y), implying a single-digit growth rate in 2HFY23F (to 15 percent). We view this guidance as conservative,” said Priyankar Biswas of Nomura in a note to clients.  “The company’s cautious outlook on margin despite several tailwinds was a dampener and this too may have impacted investor sentiment,” said Khadija Mantri, assistant vice-president, research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.  The management has given a cautious margin outlook for FY23 but she added that it also alluded to the fact that if the proportion of private orders increases in the order book, it could see margin improvement as these orders are on a nomination basis and carry higher margins. Further, new orders have been taken at better pricing and this would also help improve margins in the medium to long term.  “Any positive surprise on the margin front in H2FY23 could give fillip to the stock,” she said, adding that a robust outlook in terms of revenue, order intake and monetisation of its non-core assets could also support the stock.  L&amp;amp;T shares have gained close to 10 percent in the past month on the back of decent performance by its IT and ITeS subsidiaries and expectations of a good performance in the September quarter. Therefore, an uninspiring stock movement is an indication that a good set of quarterly numbers has prompted investors to take some money off the table, analysts believe.  “The stock has run up quite a bit recently, and is hovering around its lifetime high and has also outperformed the market. Plus, with the earnings now behind, there is some profit-taking now,” said Parikshit D Kandpal of HDFC Securities.  At 11.15 am, the scrip was trading at Rs 2,006.55, down 0.9 percent, on the BSE. It had hit its 52-week high of Rs 2,078.20.  The company has been able sustain its margins in a challenging environment with inflationary pressure and supply chain issues. “The lower end of the margin guidance itself is conservative, which provides comfort that L&amp;amp;T can achieve its guidance. So a cautious margin outlook is not that big a worry and has already been factored into the current stock price,” Kandpal explained.  He feels the outlook for L&amp;amp;T seems more promising from here on due to a couple of positives like the company reducing losses in its Hyderabad Metro Project, the IDPL divestment and a likely buyback on the cards.

The company is upbeat about its order inflow from the domestic market in India despite concerns over the slowing global growth rate, said Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman.  &quot;L&amp;amp;T's order book from India grew 73 percent on year in July-September when compared to last year,&quot; Raman said in a post-earnings conference call on October 31.  He added that two-thirds of the orders the L&amp;amp;T has added in Q2 were made up of domestic orders. In total, the company's order inflow for Q2 stood at Rs 519,14 crore.  The company saw a pick up in order inflow in Q2FY23 from segments such as infrastructure, hydrocarbon and defence. There was also a pick-up in order finalisation in the domestic market.  The management said it sees green shoots in private sector investments in certain segments, particularly in minerals and metals, healthcare, information technology and services, data centres, airports and railway station developments.  Raman added that 72 percent of L&amp;amp;T's order book was made up of domestic orders, while international orders had a share of 28 percent.  Despite the strong order flow from the domestic market, L&amp;amp;T does not expect any slowdown in foreign orders.  &quot;Slower order inflow from the middle east in Q2 was a seasonal factor and we also missed out on orders of around Rs 1500 crore,&quot; Raman said.  He added that order inflows from the middle east are only expected to rise in the coming months, especially from Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria.

Consolidated revenues for the engineering and construction major were higher by 23 percent year-on-year at Rs 42,763 crore.  L&amp;amp;T's CFO also said that the company's operating margin is unlikely to fall any further in the coming months as commodity prices have started to soften. He added that L&amp;amp;T's margins faced pressure due to depreciating currency in many countries and due to cost pressures witnessed in a few infrastructure projects.  L&amp;amp;T's EBITDA margin from its Infrastructure Projects Segment fell to 6.6 percent from 8.3 percent recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, which impacted its overall EBITDA margins as well.  “Our businesses have been facing very volatile markets globally. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has created volatility in global markets and many countries are also seeing a depreciating currency and facing an energy crisis, which has made India a bright spot for global investment,&quot; Raman said.  For the half-year ended September 30, 2022, L&amp;amp;T's consolidated revenues stood at Rs 78,616 crore recording a y-o-y growth of 23 percent with international revenues during the half-year at Rs 28,708 crore constituting 37 percent of the total.

lt,2022-09-15T12:04:30+05:30,Dipti Sharma,MC Explains | Why shares of defence companies are soaring,Defence companies could be a beneficiary of the Indian government's thrust on domestic manufacturing while geopolitical tensions across the globe could also make the sector an exciting play,"The Indian government’s increased focus on the defence sector, with initiatives such as ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, have led to a perception among market participants that companies manufacturing defence equipment will do well.  Indian defence companies are seen spreading their wings wider and are expected to soar even higher. Investors have been lapping up shares of these companies and the exuberance is evident from the stellar rise in their scrips. Here’s a primer on what is triggering the rise in defence stocks.    How have shares of defence companies performed so far in 2022?  Most defence stocks such as Bharat Dynamics, Bharat Electronics, Ashok Leyland and Hindustan Aeronautics have rallied between 34 and 123 percent in 2022, so far.  Indeed, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has shot up 264 percent in the past three years, while Bharat Dynamics has surged 210 percent. Again, Ashok Leyland and Bharat Electronics have soared 208 and 162 percent, respectively.  HAL and Bharat Dynamics have managed to generate triple-digit returns in 2022 so far, at 112 and 127 percent, respectively. In comparison, Ashok Leyland shares gained a modest 36 percent, while Bharat Electronics has risen 60 percent.  Follow our Market LIVE coverage here  Why is the market bullish on defence stocks?  Along with the Indian government’s increased focus on the defence sector, the centre’s initiatives, such as ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, have led to a perception among market participants that companies manufacturing defence equipment will do well.  Additionally, tensions with China and Pakistan, coupled with the Russia-Ukraine crisis, are seen boosting the growth outlook of defence companies.  Why and how has the government’s focus increased on the sector?  India is reportedly among the five biggest defence spenders in the world. In the FY23 budget, the government earmarked Rs 1.52 lakh crore as the capital outlay for defence, an 11 percent compounded annual growth over FY20-23. This capital outlay is around 29 percent of the total defence budget of Rs 5.25 lakh crore, as compared with approximately 25 percent in FY20.  The total defence equipment procurement budget was at Rs 1.24 lakh crore for FY23, of which Rs 84,598 crore — 68 percent of the procurement budget — has been kept for purchasing locally produced weapons and systems to boost self-reliance in the sector.  What step has the government taken so far to boost the local defence industry?  Over the last two years, the government has notified three lists totalling 310 defence items that will be procured locally in the next three to five years. Of these 310 items, 90 are planned to be indigenised by December 2022. Moreover, the Defence Ministry has also notified two lists of 458 items in the last six months for indigenisation.  The Indian government has taken several policy initiatives in the past few years under the 'Make in India' programme to encourage indigenous design, development and manufacture of defence equipment in the country, thereby reducing import of defence equipment. Expenditure on defence procurement from foreign sources has been reduced to 36 percent in 2020-21 from 46 percent in 2018-19.  So, what exactly are these defence items?  These items include major equipment or platforms such as combat aircraft, submarines, armoured vehicles, lightweight tanks, helicopters, missiles, radars, howitzers, sensors, simulators, torpedoes and unmanned aerial vehicles. Defence items for indigenisation manufacturing include sub-systems, assemblies and components.  What does the government have in store for defence companies?  Per government estimates, around Rs 5 lakh crore in contracts will be placed for defence platforms, equipment and components in the next five years, ICICI Securities said in a brokerage report. The domestic defence industry is expected to get orders worth about Rs 3.5 lakh crore in the next five years, the domestic brokerage house added.  Which companies stand to benefit?  Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Dynamics, Ashok Leyland, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders and Cochin Shipyard. Further, Bharat Electronics, Data Patterns (India), Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, Bharat Forge and BEML have the potential to gain from the recent developments.  As of June 2022, Bharat Dynamics’ order book stood at Rs 13,000 crore. Meanwhile, L&amp;amp;T’s order inflows rose 57 percent year-on-year to Rs 41,805 crore in the quarter ended June.  Analysts believe Ashok Leyland, a top supplier of vehicles to the Indian Army, could benefit from the government’s decision to increase sourcing from domestic private players.  The outlook for Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders also seems to have improved. Its order book as of March 31, 2022 was around Rs 46,000 crore.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-explains-why-shares-of-defence-companies-are-soaring-9176181.html

As an engineering, procurement and constriction (EPC) company, L&amp;amp;T’s order pipeline from the hydrocarbon sector tracks the capex in the sector. While global energy majors moderated their capex plans, the Indian counterparts have steadily invested in expansion despite high volatility in crude oil prices and Covid-related disruption.  “Internationally, particularly in the upstream side, there was a slowdown post-Covid for different reasons. Now even to maintain and sustain production, the capital has to come back. So I expect in the next three-four years, the capital expenditure will remain at a decent level,” Sarma said.  In the first quarter of 2022-23, L&amp;amp;T bagged orders worth Rs 4,366 crore, registering a substantial growth compared to the year-ago period, driven by a large order win from the Middle East in the Offshore vertical. International orders accounted for 91 percent of the total orders of the segment during the quarter.  “In India, companies have been very steady in expanding refineries and downstream petrochemical capacities. A lot of new projects have been announced in the last two-three years and it will continue for some more time, maybe not at the same pace,” Sarma said.  Supply chain disruption  But he cautioned that the global supply chain is not yet streamlined and may cause challenges.  “In terms of our revenue, our target is always to at least backfill what we burn in orders. So we have to win close to around $3 billion of orders every year. That means the pipeline has to be four-five times that because our success rate is 20 percent to 30 percent. The supply chain globally has still not come to normal and there are still problems, so that might create some disruption,” Sarma said.  Crude oil prices rise  Crude oil prices soared to $147 a barrel, close to record highs, in March this year amid supply constraints and concerns over disruptions due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prices have cooled off since then with the benchmark Brent crude futures trading around $105 a barrel now.  When asked where the crude oil price is headed, Sarma said, “If I had to put a sustainable range, I would say it will be around $85 a barrel. That's what my personal prediction is; there will be aberrations. But I think somewhere it will kind of get anchored over a longer period around $85.  So there is a $20 increase with respect to that average pricing in the near future in the next two to three years. Oil producing companies will be very happy with that number but it will be a problem for oil-consuming countries like India because they would want it to be around $50-$60.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/lt-sees-international-hydrocarbon-orders-picking-up-but-warns-of-supply-chain-disruptions-9106821.html
lt,2022-08-30T12:28:32+05:30,Rachita Prasad,"Interview | Green energy will be growth driver, hydrocarbon capex to be decent: L&amp;T Energy Head","The government’s decision to phase down and not phase out coal-based power plants gives comfort to L&amp;T that it should be able to maintain its order book from the sector, even if it doesn’t grow, Sarma said.","Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro recently consolidated its energy businesses – hydrocarbons, thermal power and green energy – to help the engineering company cater to customers as the world pivots to green and clean energy.  Subramanian Sarma, senior executive vice president at L&amp;amp;T, who earlier led its hydrocarbon business in India and overseas, now spearheads the entire energy portfolio. Speaking exclusively to Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad, he said L&amp;amp;T has identified green energy as the new growth engine and will invest $2.5 billion in this sector over the next 3-5 years.  Also Read: L&amp;amp;T to work across green energy value chain; to pump in $2.5 billion in 3-4 years  Sarma also said fossil fuel-based businesses will continue to play a key role during the energy transition. The spending slowdown during the pandemic and high crude oil prices will ensure “decent” levels of capex in the hydrocarbon industry for the next three-four years.  Edited excerpts:  How much green hydrogen does the plant at Hazira produce and how do you plan to scale it up? Who are the customers?  We will have a final capacity of 45 kg per day. Currently, we are not producing that much – maybe we are producing little less than half. But very soon, we will take it to full capacity or 800 KW – it is better to measure it in terms of power output. We want to try two different types of electrolysers – alkaline and PEM (proton exchange membrane). As we are decarbonising, we also want to gather some knowledge in terms of the relative performance of the two technologies so that we can learn and then also take this to our customers.  Who would be the customers for the green hydrogen business?  We will get into electrolyser manufacturing but we haven’t yet finalised the technology for it. Our main plan is to offer whole green solutions to customers—from installing projects to supplying them green hydrogen. We will use the joint venture we have with Indian Oil Corporation and ReNew Power to provide integrated solutions. There are many other facets of green energy solutions, which we will do independently as L&amp;amp;T.  Many companies, including Reliance Industries and the Adani Group, plan to enter this space. How is the industry preparing for green hydrogen?  In the next 5-10 years, this market will become quite sizable because green hydrogen has to become an integral part of the energy basket which today includes coal, fossil fuels like oil and gas, and renewable power. How that energy basket grows and what will be the share of green hydrogen in that will depend on how competitive it becomes.  Currently, it is not competitive. As we get scale and the technology improves, it should become more competitive – that is what everyone is aiming for. Therefore, all industrial houses, private and public sector will have to walk this path. I don't think there is a choice.  There are common problems for everyone; we are still relying on imported technology. So different technology tie-ups are being explored. Many companies are doing research and development to set up electrolyser units with their in-house technology. The renewable energy market is already quite mature in India now. Now, the focus is on electrolysers and various solutions related to hydrogen.  L&amp;amp;T has decided to be ‘asset-light’ and has exited various development businesses. Why has the company decided to be a developer for green hydrogen and not just an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) player in the space?  We will continue to be an EPC player and our overall strategy to be asset-light is still very much intact. That is the route we want to pursue. But for that, certain services and products, we also had to adapt to the market conditions as it evolves. That requires development capability and we have to be open to that.  That’s why we have formed a joint venture that brings three balance sheets together and the investment gets spread out. This way our balance sheet will be relatively lighter than if we have to do it ourselves. We will invest in a business only when the economics support that; we have clear target on what our return on equity and internal rate of return should be.  Now that you have joint venture partners, would you look for more tie-ups for technology?  In the immediate term, we need to have technology because we have not developed it yet. As a country, we have not invested enough time and resources on that. So we'll have to satisfy the immediate needs based on available technology. We'll have to scout around and look for the right technology and the right framework in which we can operate.  But in parallel, we will continue to also invest effort, time and resources in developing our own technology. With the kind of expertise we have in high-precision manufacturing and the various systems we have developed within L&amp;amp;T, I think we can do it. It is going to take some time to have our own technology but we are getting into it for the long haul.  You recently said L&amp;amp;T will invest $2.5 billion on green energy. What will be the time period for this investment and what will be the focus area?  We are focusing on three main building blocks – manufacturing electrolysers with a technology tie-up, energy storage solutions, and the development role, wherever such opportunities come. We will invest this amount over 3-5 years. These numbers are the current assessment – we will have to see how the market evolves.  What are your expectations from the government’s much-awaited second phase of the green hydrogen policy, said to be on offering financial incentives?  The government is definitely going to do something to allow the industry to kick start. At this point, cost competitiveness is not there, so we have to keep affordability in mind. So they will do enough to kickstart the process.  But you have to also recognise that there is an export market. India has become quite competitive in renewable sources of power, especially the generation of solar power. We have the opportunity to leapfrog and not only look at the internal market but also explore the export market.  What’s the outlook for L&amp;amp;T’s hydrocarbon business?  The hydrocarbon business is more or less steady. In terms of outlook, it is more positive because there has not been much investment during the last two-three years. Since 2018-19, investment had slowed down in the hydrocarbon sector. In India, companies have been very steady in expanding refineries and downstream petrochemical capacities.  A lot of new projects have been announced in the last two-three years and it will continue for some more time, maybe not at the same pace. Internationally, particularly in the upstream side, there was a slowdown post-Covid for different reasons. Now, even to maintain and sustain production, the capital has to come back. So I expect for the next three-four years, the capital expenditure will remain at a decent level.  What is the order pipeline for the hydrocarbon business?  In terms of our revenue, our target is always to at least backfill what we burn in orders. So we have to win close to around $3 billion of orders every year. That means the pipeline has to be four-five times of that because our success rate is 20 percent to 30 percent. The supply chain globally has still not come to normal and there are still problems, so that might create some disruption.  What is your outlook on crude prices? When you prepare a business plan, what kind of levels are you looking at?  If I had to put a sustainable range, I would say it will be around $85 a barrel. That's what my personal prediction is; there will be aberrations. But I think somewhere it will kind of get anchored over a longer period around $85. So there is a $20 increase with respect to that average pricing in the near future in the next two to three years. Oil-producing companies will be very happy with that number but it will be a problem for oil-consuming countries like India because they would want it to be around $50-$60.  Also Read: What is green hydrogen? Why Adani, Reliance, L&amp;amp;T are investing in this source of clean energy?  Fossil fuel-based power projects have slowed. What is the outlook on the power business? What’s your strategy?  If you asked me one-and-a-half-years ago, my answer would have been very negative. But at the COP26 (UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow) India said it will “phase down” instead of phasing out and exiting coal-based power plants. This means that there will be some additional thermal power plant capacity added because it is required.  I am a firm believer that at least for the next decade, you will have all sources of energy playing together and they will coexist. Coal-based thermal power plants will also be necessary because solar cannot provide 24x7 solutions as the cost of storage batteries is still high.  There are now new technologies to reduce emissions from coal-based power plant. I expect that five to 10 gigawatts of capacity should get added annually for the next few years and then we’ll have to watch. There will be a scale-down in the business, but I think it is still too early to hang up boots or call it off. We would aim to maintain the order book; it’s not a growing business.  There is a global push on energy transition. Fossil fuel-based companies are looking at ways to be green. What are the biggest challenges in energy transition now?  The transition to green energy and alternative sources of energy is inevitable. I think every organisation will have to do it because global warming is real now and not just a myth. The whole world is driving towards it, including investments. Now, at what pace it happens will depend upon affordability. Europe has gone much faster because their economy was different. The US, with the new administration in place, is moving little bit faster towards transition.  The developing economies and emerging economies like India will have to balance that. They need clean and sustainable energy and energy security but they also need affordability. I think all the companies will have a leg in all the three sources of energy – clean energy (nuclear), fossil energy, and green energy. Energy transition will not be 100 percent – it will be a gradual process where the energy mix will change.  How conducive is the Indian environment for financing the energy transition?  If you want to access funds, you should be able to get that. I don't see fund availability as a constraint. It's the technology and the cost that are the challenge. If you borrow money, then you have ensure that the project is economically viable and that the consumer should be able to afford that. I think the pace of transition will not be limited by the availability of funds, but the pace may be more if we can add scale and bring costs down.  How are you getting the right talent? Also, are our universities and colleges producing enough talent suitable for the changes taking place?  In terms of green hydrogen or green fuels, this domain is very familiar to us at L&amp;amp;T. We understand the product – L&amp;amp;T has dealing in hydrogen for the past 20 years – whether it is black, gray, or green, it is a molecule. Secondly, the battery storage systems, electrolyser and the paraphernalia which goes around building this have been applied in various segments as we already there in EPC.  Electrolyser is a new thing as a product but we have a deep knowledge of precision manufacturing. So we have the talent and the skills available, which we can always deploy. Having said that, there will always be some gaps and I think we'll have to fill that through our internal training programme. But personally, I will not put skill availability and skillsets on the top of my list of worries.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/interview/interview-green-energy-will-be-growth-driver-hydrocarbon-capex-to-be-decent-lt-energy-head-9106611.html

Touted as a technological marvel, this 3D-printed post office is expected to cut construction costs down to one-fourth the amount spent on a traditional model, reports The New Indian Express.  The post office will be located at Cambridge Layout in the Halasuru area of the capital of Karnataka.  According to Times Now, the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has given its nod to the project for which construction will be carried out by Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro.  Authorities say that cutting down construction costs was a major reason behind going for a 3D-printed post office. Along with low construction costs, the 3D printed building has another advantage – it is expected to be completed within a month.  “We are keen on building low-cost post offices. Hence, we approached Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Construction in connection with building our Halasuru Bazaar sub-post office. It is said to be the only company undertaking 3D printing-enabled construction in India,” Chief Post Master General, Karnataka Circle, S Rajendra Kumar told TNIE.  “A building of around 1,000 square feet here would cost less than Rs 25 lakh if 3D printing technology is used. This would work out to just 25 per cent of the normal construction cost,” he added.  L&amp;amp;T is currently the only company in India that is utilising 3D printing technology to construct buildings – which is why the construction contract was not opened for competitive bidding.  ““As a rule, any contract running to over Rs 2.5 lakh must be opened up for competitive bidding.

If we see the recovery from June, when the market had broken its 52-week low, the rally stands at more than 16 percent, which has a been one-way rally so far.  Experts are hopeful that the third burst of market recovery, which we have seen after record high levels in January and April, will endure.  In the changing environment, signs of easing inflation, likely softening of the central bank’s stance on interest rates, a mood upswing at FII desks —these are all in line with better than expected earnings in the June FY23 quarter.  In fact, once the dust of uncertainty settles, markets are expected to hit new highs in the coming months. The one caveat may be the China-Taiwan issue. If that does not get escalated, then the market’s northward journey is definitely anticipated, experts said.  Though the sectoral trend over the last one year is mixed, every sector has participated in the last two months of recovery.  &quot;At CMP (current market price), the Nifty is trading at 22.1x FY23E and 18.6x FY24E, below its long-term average. Due to ongoing uncertainty and global challenges, we expect Nifty to trade in the range of 16x-18x FY24E in 1HFY23,’’ said Nishant Srivastava, Head, Retail Broking and Distribution, Reliance Securities.  But going ahead, he believes the strong economic rebound, normalised commodity prices, inflation within the target range, and better visibility by 2HFY23 would transform Nifty valuation to close to the historical average.  Srivastava’s FY23 target for the Nifty is 19,000 at 20x FY24E EPS. Reliance Securities expects FII inflows to return by end of 1HFY23, while DII investments would continue in FY23, and equities would maintain their outperformance with double-digit returns.  FIIs have bought more than Rs 14,800 crore worth of shares in August, the first month of net buying in the last 11 months, and the biggest monthly net purchases since February 2021.  Given the confidence in market trends, experts advised buying 11 stocks which could deliver about 20 percent returns by next August:  Expert: Vikram Kasat, Head Advisory at Prabhudas Lilladher  Narayana Hrudayalaya  Narayana Hrudayalaya reported highest ever profitability in Q1 from its India business, and Cayman profitability should recover from Q2. We expect EBITDA CAGR of 21 percent over FY22-24E.  Despite capex intensity going up, RoE / RoCE will remain healthy at around 25 percent in FY24. We maintain ‘buy’ with a price target of Rs 810 per share (20x FY24E EV/EBITDA for India biz +16x EV/EBITDA for Cayman hospitals). EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, while RoE is return on equity, and RoCE is return on capital employed.  S Chand and Company  We believe the turnaround is complete and the company is back on the growth track. Trades at 14x/8x of our FY23/FY24 EPS. Valuations are undemanding for a business that commands free cash flow yield of around 14-17 percent over FY23-FY24E.  Additionally, the National Education Policy represents an option value in the business and can result in sharp re-rating. We retain buy with a target of Rs 185 (earlier Rs 156).  Expert: Sonam Srivastava, Founder, Wright Research  Tata Elxsi  Tata Elxsi is not a traditional tech stock. It is a new-age product development company working closely with some of the global majors in the auto sector in the electric vehicle (EV) space.  Tata Elxsi addresses the engineering and research and development segment, and global innovation companies depend on companies like Tata Elxsi to do the backend work.  While other tech companies have struggled in the last quarter, Tata Elxsi has delivered 15.45 percent EPS growth and posted a lifetime-high revenue of Rs 736.21 crore.  The company focuses on four key verticals: transportation, media, telecom, and healthcare. Revenue and stock price growth is expected to continue through the coming year.  Varun Beverages  Varun Beverages is a franchisee bottler of carbonated and non-carbonated beverages sold under trademarks owned by PepsiCo. This FMCG company has grown its revenue 75.08 percent last quarter.  With inflationary pressures cooling off and discretionary spends coming back, Varun beverages is expected to perform well. It has acquired new territories and plans to expand distribution by venturing into underpenetrated territories.  The expected CAGR for the company next year is more than 20 percent, which makes it an excellent buy in the current market scenario.  Indian Hotels Company  Indian Hotels has had a fantastic run since last year, which will continue into the next year. The company posted 33 percent revenue growth and maintained a 30 percent EBIDTA margin. Post-Covid reopening favours the hotel industry, and the festive season will make the stock even more enjoyable.  The company's business model is shifting from asset-heavy to 50 percent owned and leased business, and 50 percent fee-based business. They have also added new companies, which are high-margin businesses that will make the next year positive for revenues and margin expansion.  Expert: Nishant Srivastava, Head, Retail Broking and Distribution, Reliance Securities  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro  We believe L&amp;amp;T deserves a higher valuation, given the revival of order-flows in large multilateral projects, uptick in the investment cycle, and the healthy performance of its subsidiaries.  Considering the healthy guidance, a strong order book, along with order prospects of Rs 7.6 trillion, we have a buy rating on L&amp;amp;T, with a SOTP-based target price of Rs 2,125.  Maruti Suzuki India  We expect MSIL's domestic volume to witness 20 percent growth in FY23E. In exports, we estimate a healthy 17 percent CAGR over FY22-FY24E, on the back of better sales through the Toyota tie up.  In view of the strong products basket, healthy balance sheet, strong return ratios, and likely margin improvement ahead, we have a buy rating on MSIL with a target price of Rs 9,700, valuing the stock at a 27x P/E multiple.  Escorts Kubota  We believe that the benefits of softer commodity costs, rural revival, and overall economic recovery would play out gradually in 2HFY23E, which would support the valuations going forward.  In view of the long-term positive trend of the tractor industry, likely synergy benefit from Kubota, a healthy balance sheet, strong positive cash flow, healthy return ratios, and attractive valuation, we have a buy rating on Escorts with target price of Rs 2,250, valuing the stock at an unrevised P/E of 21x FY24E EPS.  Expert: Devarsh Vakil, Deputy Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities  HOEC  Incorporated in 1983, Hindustan Oil Exploration Company (HOEC) is engaged in oil exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas in on-shore and off-shore fields.  HOEC was the first mid-size private company in India to enter into oil and gas exploration. Its operational activities commenced in 1991. HOEC provides geological and geophysical services relating to the exploration of oil and natural gas, and other field services. The company has built a strong portfolio of on-shore and off-shore fields in India.  Going ahead, we think existing investors can hold and new investors can buy the stock and add on dips of Rs 156-152 for the bull case fair value of Rs 214 over the next two quarters. We expect HOEC revenue could grow more than two fold in FY23, and 36 percent in FY24.  Can Fin Homes  Can Fin Homes (CFHL) is a well-established player in the affordable housing finance segment. The company has a quality portfolio comprising salaried customers with low ticket size loans. CFHL has impeccable track record of delivering consistent and strong growth while maintaining best-in-class asset quality. The sovereign holding (Canara Bank as promoter) provides access to low-cost funding opportunities.  With a strong balance sheet, the company has the opportunity to increase its market share as well as scale up its presence in existing and newer geographies.  There has been a strong revival in the real estate sector as evident from improved sales momentum and new offerings.  CFHL remains well placed to capture rising opportunities in the Bangalore real estate market (around 20 percent of assets under management).  Favourable Indian demographics, low mortgage penetration, and government support are the key long term positives for the sector. Any slowdown in the real estate sector, promoters’ exit, and rising interest rates are key risks for the company.  We feel investors can buy Can Fin Homes on dips of Rs 634-630 (2.1x FY24 adjusted book value), and add more on dips of Rs 574-570 (1.9x FY24 adjusted book value) for the bull case fair value of Rs 754 (2.5x FY24 ABV) over the next two quarters.  AVT Natural Products  AVT Natural Products (AVT) was incorporated in 1994 by the AV Thomas group to diversify its traditional plantation business.  AVT is a leading manufacturer of plant-based extracts and natural ingredient-based solutions for the food, beverage, animal nutrition, and nutraceutical industries of the world.  Founded in 1925 as a plantation company, AVT is a family-owned, professionally-managed group, with headquarters in Chennai.  The group’s business interests include plantations (tea, rubber, coffee, spices), consumer products (tea, coffee, and spices), leather goods, medical appliances (manufactures and markets Rusch Foley catheters and distributes several other products in India), biotech (plant tissue culture), commodity exports (spices, natural rubber, coir products and food items), logistics (licensed custom agents, air and sea cargo agents, and warehousing), trading and agencies (building materials, rubber chemicals, etc.), and Food and Feed Ingredients (AVT Natural Products, AVT Integrated Spice Project and AVT McCormick Ingredients).  The group’s products have a fair brand value in south India and the family is respected for its business acumen. AVT has good credibility due to its long presence in the region and industry.  We think the bull case fair value is Rs 124 (19.5x FY24E EPS). Investors can buy the stock in Rs 90-96 band (14.6x FY24E EPS) and add more on dips of Rs 85-81 (13.0x FY24E EPS) band.

As a part of its asset-light strategy, L&amp;amp;T has identified some non-core operations that it wants to exit. While the company denied media reports that it is in a pact to sell eight roads, and a power transmission project to Edelweiss fund for Rs 7,000 crore, the management said that it is hopeful of closing the deal for the sale of the assets in the current fiscal.   “The approach will be to sell our investment in the platform, which is a work in progress. Investment in infrastructure is a very challenging space and today largely it is the international funds which are interested,” Raman said.   “We are careful that we want to sell it to an agency or investor who will actually take the platform forward…we are making progress with every quarter.”  The company has also identified its thermal power generation unit, the Nabha power plant in Punjab for divestment. Commenting on it, Raman said, “Nabha Power is a work in progress because it is a thermal project, which has limited takers among people who already have the capacity and want to consolidate.” He said that the project’s ability to run at a high plant load factor will lure strategic investors.  With regards to the third divestment target, L&amp;amp;T Metro Rail (Hyderabad), the company said it is working on a de-risking plan before it can divest it. The project, which was built for Rs 18,000 crore, has a concession agreement with the state to operate it for 35 years. The project was marred with delays due to right-of-way issues and issues with approvals, leading to cost overruns. The revenue from the project did not match the initial projection and was further hit by Covid-led disruptions.   Raman said that L&amp;amp;T is working on reducing risk in the Hyderabad metro project by refinancing debt, monetising real estate assets, seeking government grants, getting a co-investor, and increasing ridership.  SN Subrahmanyan, chief executive officer and managing director of L&amp;amp;T had told Moneycontrol in an interview in May that the company aims to close at least two of its major divestment plans to become a zero-debt company, excluding the debt of its non-banking financial arm L&amp;amp;T Finance, by the end of 2022-23.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/lt-will-exits-road-portfolio-by-fy23-other-divestments-are-work-in-progress-cfo-8894161.html

The company does not plan to revise it upwards despite the strong performance in the first quarter of 2022-23 on concerns over the slowing global growth rate, said Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman.   On July 26, L&amp;amp;T reported 45 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,702 crore in Q1FY23. Consolidated revenues for the engineering and construction major were higher by 22.2 percent year-on-year at Rs 35,853 crore.  “This quarter saw a lot of pickup in activities as COVID concerns are receding. However, concurrently, geopolitical developments and inflation worries sweeping through the world have unsettled the global economy. There are several commentaries that are being put out about how the global economy is likely to fail in the coming months; it is going to be interesting to watch these developments as India picks up momentum,” Raman said.   The company’s management said that the June quarter, which is typically a seasonally weak quarter, saw high order execution and robust order inflow which resulted in its highest ever order book at Rs 3,63,448 crore at June end.  “We are in business only when there are people who are investing. We are seeing a certain amount of global stress in terms of growth. All major economies are recalibrating their growth and India will be no exception to this. We need to wait and watch as to how it pans out.

According to a poll of brokerages accessed by Moneycontrol.com, the Mumbai-based company is forecast to achieve a consolidated PAT of Rs 1,816 crore as compared to a PAT of Rs 1,174 crore it registered during the same period last year. Its profit during the previous quarter stood at Rs 3,621 crore.  The revenue for the quarter is seen at Rs 35,012 crore, compared to Rs 29,335 crore recorded during the last year period. The company had recorded consolidated revenue of Rs 52,851 crore during the previous quarter.  The company is likely to declare its results for the first quarter ended June 2022, tomorrow.    The softening of commodity prices, especially steel helped maintain the margins on a yearly basis, and strong execution across projects aided growth in L&amp;amp;T’s EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) revenues during the quarter.  “We expect significant growth traction YoY due to a large opening order book and also from a weak COVID-19 impacted base of Q1FY22”, a report from Nomura Global Markets Research said.  Almost all the brokerages expect strong YoY improvement in core EPC revenues driven by improved construction activity during the quarter.  According to a report from Anand Rathi Research, the revenue from the services vertical are expected to jump 29 percent year on year.  However, the brokerages are of the opinion that the order inflows announced so far by the company are below their expectations but going forward they are optimistic about the pick-up in momentum of order flows. The order inflows for core businesses are expected to be in the range of Rs 22,500 – 23,500 crore during the quarter.  The EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins for the quarter are expected to be flat year on year but likely to decline on a sequential basis due to rise in input costs.  “We build a flat OPM (operating margin) YoY due to increase in input cost particularly for fixed priced contracts but margin would decline QoQ on account of sequential rise in input costs”, a report from Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said.

We will be more of a technology solutions provider company and that is robust and good from an overall point of view,” Subrahmanyan said.   In this five-year period, L&amp;amp;T will continue capital expenditure in current businesses– projects, manufacturing and realty, step up investments in new businesses such as digital platforms and data centers and its green energy portfolio. The company will also be open to acquisitions in IT and TS segments to fill gaps in its offerings.   “In the EPC project business, will continue to grow at 11 to 13 per cent. The last two years were impacted by Covid and looking at them does not give the right picture. If you look at the trend overall, it continues to grow at 11 - 13 per cent,” the CEO said.   L&amp;amp;T reported its highest ever consolidated order book at Rs 357,595 crore as on March 31, 2022, with international orders having a share of 27 percent.  “The hi-tech manufacturing business will grow at between 12 to 15 per cent. Our shops are full right now. We continue to expect that these sectors will get sufficient orders with the growth of refinery, petrochemical, green business and such,” Subrahmanyan said.    The company hopes that its services business, excluding L&amp;amp;T Financial, which have been growing over 20- 25 per cent will be boosted by the merger of its arms L&amp;amp;T Infotech Ltd (LTI) and and Mindtree Ltd. “LTI is very strong in ERP (enterprise resource planning), and Mindtree is very strong in the customer experience space. A combination of these provides a fantastic service input to the clients,” he said.   L&amp;amp;T first launched a five-year strategic plan in FY2000-FY2005, calling it Project Blue Chip. Thereafter it undertook Lakshya 1 (FY2005-FY10), Lakshya 2 (FY2010-FY15), Lakshya 2021 (FY2017-FY2021). Lakshya 2 was extended by a year since the company didn’t achieve some of the targets, and the new plan was also delayed by a year due to Covid-related disruptions.   New Businesses   Lakshya’26 would see L&amp;amp;T grow some of its fledgling businesses, which the company is incubating like startups– L&amp;amp;T-SuFin, which is an integrated platform for buying and selling of industrial products and services, and L&amp;amp;T EduTech, which is a digital education platform for industry-led practical and application-oriented engineering curriculum.    When asked if L&amp;amp;T will drive scale in these startup ventures and then go for an initial public offering for them, like it has done with other subsidiaries from the group, Subrahmanyan said, &quot;Time will tell whether the new initiatives are good startups or where it goes. I hope I can repeat the winning formula.”  The strategic plan will also see L&amp;amp;T transition towards green energy, with focus on green hydrogen and grid based battery storage.   “At the moment, it’s not viable because the battery costs upwards of $190 per kilowatt hour. It needs to come down drastically for it to be viable as a power source. We are again in touch with some technology players to see how we can jointly do some research and development to bring the battery costs down. And if that happens during the latter part of the planned period, it could see some investments in the battery space, but not right now,” Subrahmanyan said.   In the green hydrogen space, the company has already tied up with ReNew Power and state-run Indian Oil Corporation. L&amp;amp;T has also signed a pact with Norway-based electrolyzer technology and manufacturer HydrogenPro AS to set up a manufacturing unit in India.   The company plans to invest around Rs 1,000 crores for a 500 MW electrolyser production capacity. It is in talks with its joint venture partner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to potentially convert their power turbine generator unit into a manufacturing unit for electrolysers.  The joint venture with Mitsubishi has been hit due to lack of new thermal coal based power projects in India.  Commenting on the JV, Subrahmanyan said, “We are talking to them; they're also worried. They also have coal and gas power factories in other parts of the world. So both of us are in dialogue and if something else comes out of it, we'll do that. Otherwise, we will have to jointly think of how to take it forward, including making electrolysers as such in those factories.”  Subrahmanyan said that talent management across L&amp;amp;T’s businesses will be a priority for the company.   “To achieve our strategic plan and be a Rs 2.73 lakh crore organisation by 2026, we need a huge amount of talent within the organisation. I spend a lot of time mentoring people, talking to people, even recruiting people. This is probably the single biggest chance and opportunity that I have to develop the right set of leaders from a succession point of view.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/lt-aims-at-doubling-revenue-and-order-inflow-in-five-years-8512201.html

SN Subrahmanyan, chief executive officer and managing director of Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on May 13 that the company has made significant progress in divesting three of its non-core businesses, one of which is the loss-making L&amp;amp;T Metro Rail (Hyderabad). He said that these assets would be moved out of L&amp;amp;T’s balance sheet by the end of the current fiscal.   “L&amp;amp;T’s overall debt is Rs 1,24,000 crore, out of that Rs 84,000 crore is from L&amp;amp;T Financial Services, which is not really a debt but their borrowing so that they can lend. So the real debt was Rs 40,000 crore. If Hyderabad Metro’s Rs 13,000 crore debt and Nabha power’s Rs 6,000 crore debt move away, all we have is a debt of Rs 20,000 crore, which is what is the working capital requirement of L&amp;amp;T. We can become a zero-debt company by the later part of the year,” Subrahmanyan said.  As a part of L&amp;amp;T’s strategic plan for FY17-21, the company aimed to exit some non-core assets and focus on its core competence of engineering, procurement and construction jobs and services and become an asset-light company. In May 2018, L&amp;amp;T announced a deal to sell its electrical and automation business to France-headquartered Schneider Electric for Rs 14,000 crore. The deal was finally closed in August 2020.  The company also announced its intent to sell the other three assets but is yet to conclude them.  The worst may be over for Hyderabad metro  L&amp;amp;T, through subsidiary L&amp;amp;T Metro Rail (Hyderabad), built the Rs 18,000-crore project that has a concession period of 35 years, which can be extended. The project was initially delayed due to the right-of-way issues and other approvals, leading to cost overruns. Then the revenue from the project did not match initial projection and was further hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. This loss-making project has weighed on the overall financial performance of the parent company.  “Two factors that were not going well for the project. One, a lot of people were not traveling to the office due to Covid. Traffic had gone down very drastically, now it’s sort of coming back. As we speak, it's about 300,000 people per day. The second issue was the huge debt of nearly Rs 13,000 crores, so there was interest cost,” Subrahmanyan said.   “In our profit and loss account, this project was probably the only loss making business we have.”  L&amp;amp;T had last year sought financial support from the Telangana government to deal with the financial stress, citing that the losses would make it impossible to continue operations. After much discussion with the state government, the latter has agreed to give the project a soft loan of Rs 3,000 crore which over come over a period of time. This will be used to repay debt and reduce it to Rs 10,000 crore.  “We have a term sheet with an investor, which I cannot reveal right now because a few conditions precedents are to be overcome. It will be overcome shortly. And if that happens, another Rs 4,000 crores of equity money will come into the project. With this, we will come down from 100 percent to 51 per cent,” he said.  Subrahmanyan said that the deal proceeds would be used to pare debt to Rs 6,000 crore.   “We can also monetize some real estate, which we’ll do shortly. That will reduce debt to nearly Rs 4000 crore to Rs 5000 crores. We have recently restructured the loan and an interest rate, which was 9.7 percent has been brought down to 6.2 percent. So with this, whatever can be done financially has been done in the project,” he said.   While he declined to name the likely investor, reports suggest it may be National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF).   “We just have to hope that the offices open, people start going back to office and the project will become cashflow positive and even viable over a period of time. The best that can be done in Hyderabad metro is to move it away from the balance sheet by doing an infrastructure investment fund (InvIT) over a period of time, for which we have in-principal permission from the government. It may take two-three years, but we will do that,” he said.   Deals in the offing   In August 2021, L&amp;amp;T initiated the process to sell its entire 51 percent in L&amp;amp;T IDPL after its other key shareholder, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), indicated it was unlikely to consolidate its investment in the company. The Canadian pension fund had invested in L&amp;amp;T IDPL in 2014 and increased its stake to around 49 percent, and was expected to buy out the remaining stake from L&amp;amp;T but that did not happen.   “We have a term sheet with a prominent investor. We have our stake down to 51 percent. During the course of the year, we will move IDPL away from our balance sheet. It will no longer be an L&amp;amp;T company. It is work-in-progress and we'll announce it as it happens,” Subrahmanyan said.    The Nabha power plant, which has two units of 700 megawatts each of supercritical thermal power plants at Rajpura in the state of Punjab since 2014 has been on the block for some time too.   “We are talking to an investor and we hope to move the project away from our balance sheet more or less by the end of the year,” the CEO said.   L&amp;amp;T has finalised its next five-year strategic plan, Lakshya’26, which aims at increasing revenue to Rs 2,740 billion by FY26 from Rs 1,360 billion in FY21. This plan aims to divest concessions and sub-scale businesses, focus on infrastructure projects and hi-tech manufacturing and increase the contribution of information technology and services in the company’s overall performance. ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/lt-aims-to-go-zero-debt-by-end-fy23-selling-off-two-non-core-businesses-says-ceo-subrahmanyan-8512031.html

SN Subrahmanyan, chief executive officer and managing director of L&amp;amp;T, said that the engineering major, which currently derives most of its revenue from the infrastructure sector, aims to be a technology solution provider of eminence in the near future. In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad, Subrahmanyan talks about the road ahead, aspirations to be zero debt and a clean energy solutions provider, and how he is incubating startups within one of India’s oldest infrastructure groups. Edited excerpts:  Despite the challenges in order inflow that you witnessed in FY22, especially as domestic order inflows declined, you have given a target of 12-15 percent growth in order inflow and revenue. What’s behind this thinking?  It’s positive thinking. We’ve done well, we grew our orders by 10 percent, sales by 15 percent and we’ve grown profit by 10 percent. It’s a very good record to have under an excruciatingly tough situation born out by COVID, the European war situation, the commodity price increase, and logistical mismatch that is happening. L&amp;amp;T and the people who work here have been resilient. This gives us a good feeling that L&amp;amp;T-ites are able to outperform even in an extremely tough situation. Therefore, as the situation eases, we can continue on the path as there is momentum now. One of the biggest challenges has been to get people to infrastructure projects sites. At the project sites, unless you do physical work, there is no billing. We normally employ about 65,000 staff and about 290,000 labourers on our project sites. There was difficulty there as two times the labour went away, and we had to bring them back. We normally employ about 65,000 as our staff and about 290,000 contractual workers to do physical labour at our project sites. Due to COVID, on two occasions the contractual workers left for their native places and we had to arrange for their return. That’s not easy. In the last 24 months, we have not worked for eight to nine months because of COVID. Now the momentum is back, people are back to sites. But there’s a worry about commodity prices, for which we’ve taken adequate measures. But beyond that, we’re pushing on all cylinders and there is a possibility that sales, and profit can continue to grow in this environment.  At the press conference on May 12, the management said there is significant deferment in orders, and that government orders are not coming in as fast as it used to. What’s your outlook on the order tendering process?  The last two years, we had a blockbuster budget from the government. Now the budget has been translated into action. A huge amount of investment has been planned across core sectors like roads, railways, water projects, power transmission and hydrocarbon. We are present in all these areas so it has had a positive effect on us. And that’s why you see the robust order growth. Now what has happened is that when the crude prices suddenly shot up and as India is heavily dependent on crude, some of the money that we have budgeted gets diverted towards crude. Second, inflation is raising the head, not only in India but across the globe, and we need to be careful and watchful about it. Third, there is a very unnatural increase in prices, which is not only due to raw material price increase but also due to excess profit being made by commodity firms. This does impact the infrastructure space. The government’s budgets are made two-three years earlier, and when we bid for them, due to these factors we bid higher. If the bid is 10-15 percent higher in range, the government departments go through the process and bids are approved and orders are placed. But now due to commodity price increase, bid prices are higher by 20 percent or more. In that case, government departments and public sector companies cannot go through with the bidding and need to debate and justify the price rise. So there could be some deferment or shift in projects. That is bound to be a bit irritating, because what should happen in one month will take two months or three months to happen.  Your EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin declined in FY22 and, as you mentioned, commodity prices continue to remain high. Given that and your ability to pass on the cost burden to customers, what will the margins be for FY23?  The margin depends on many factors, of which two are most important. As a project company, margin is realised only after the project has done 25 percent of its cost. During the COVID period, jobs which ought to be accounted for profit recognition or valuation in the previous year have not come through and have been deferred to this year. Second, due to the commodity price increase, we deliberately defer some projects. About 85 percent of our contracts are covered with price variation/reimbursement or other such clauses. But about 15 percent of the contracts are not covered by this. Today, the inflation is such that even the WPI increase does not reflect the inflation. Inflation is slightly higher than the WPI graph. So we are experiencing some cost pressures within the system. We will have to manage it. We’ll have to do projects faster, take it up with the clients, and hedge materials. One cannot run away from the fact that there is a cost push, that is what has been reflected in the slight decline in margins in FY22. That will continue during the year, but we will manage it.  What is the order pipeline for potential projects that you could bid for looking like? What are the sectors that will drive the growth?  Being very cautiously optimistic on this, the order prospects that we are looking at is Rs 8 lakh crore to Rs 9 lakh crore, same as last year. We expect momentum to pick up. Key sectors would be water, power transmission, minerals and metals, and hydrocarbon projects.  You have finalised the five-year strategic plan Lakshya 26 which aims at increasing revenue to Rs 2.73 lakh crore by FY26 from Rs 1.36 lakh crore in FY21. This plan was deferred due to the pandemic but now that it’s finalised, what is the goal?   We are in three broad sectors right now as an organisation, the largest being the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) projects, the second being the hi-tech manufacturing which includes our heavy engineering and defence, and the third is the services sector, which includes L&amp;amp;T Infotech (LTI), Mindtree, L&amp;amp;T Technology Services (LTTS), and also the outlier L&amp;amp;T Financial Services. So when you look to 2026, these are the three sectors that we will be in; all our investments and plans will be centred on this.  What are the growth targets for the EPC and heavy engineering space in Lakshya’26?  The EPC project business will continue to grow at 11-13 percent. The last two years were impacted by COVID and looking at them does not give the right picture. If you look at the trend overall, it continues to grow at 11-13 percent.  The hi-tech manufacturing business will grow at between 12 percent and 15 percent. Our shops are full right now. We continue to expect that these sectors will get sufficient orders with the growth of refinery, petrochemical, green business and such.  How will the services business play out during Lakshya’26?  The services business, excluding L&amp;amp;T Financial, have been growing upwards of 20-25 percent. We do believe with the merger of LTI and Mindtree, subject to statutory approvals, the combined entity will see robust growth. LTI is very strong in ERP (enterprise resource planning), and Mindtree is very strong in the customer experience space. A combination of these provides a fantastic service input to clients.  What would L&amp;amp;T look like after Lakshya’26 ends?  As we look into the future, the EPC project business, which is about 70 percent of the company, may come down to about 65 percent and the 5 percent space could get occupied by the IT and technology services business. This means the market cap of L&amp;amp;T, which is now 30 percent by IT and technology services companies, can become 40-45 percent. So we will be more profitable, average weighted average profitability will go up. We will be more of a technology solutions provider company and that is robust and good from an overall point of view.  L&amp;amp;T has been increasingly looking at the green energy business. What kind of plans do you have for this space in the strategic plan?  L&amp;amp;T is a truly integrated power company—from mining equipment, transportation of coal, making boiler turbines, putting up EPC power plants, running your own power plant, doing power transmission distribution projects, and we were even present in the medium- and low-voltage switchgears business. We have moved away from some of these businesses one by one; we sold off the switchgear business. We don’t find huge traction coming in our boiler and turbine business for coal-fired plants. But we do not want to lose the fact that we’ve been in this business for decades and that is very fundamental to L&amp;amp;T because power is the backbone of the economy.  So the logical move is to look at the green power business. We are the largest EPC player in solar, but we don’t want to be invested in solar projects. So we are looking at getting into manufacturing for electrolysers (for green hydrogen), which can be done in our turbine factory. We are in touch with various technology players across the world, with the right technology and the momentum, to make electrolysers. The investment will be in the region of about Rs 1,000 crore for a 500-megawatt electrolyser production capacity, which is more than adequate at the moment. We also tied up with Indian Oil Corporation and ReNew Power for green hydrogen.  We also thought that being in the green energy space, we will have to be in the grid battery storage space. At the moment, it’s not viable because the battery costs upwards of $190 per kilowatt hour. It needs to come down drastically for it to be viable as a power source. We are again in touch with some technology players to see how we can jointly do some research and development to bring battery costs down. And if that happens during the latter part of the planned period, it could see some investments in the battery space, but not right now.  How are your monetisation plans for Hyderabad Metro coming along?  Two factors that were not going well for the project. One, a lot of people were not travelling to office due to COVID. Traffic had gone down very drastically, now it’s sort of coming back. As we speak, it’s about 300,000 people per day. The second issue was the huge debt of nearly Rs 13,000 crore, so there was interest cost. In our profit and loss account, this project was probably the only loss-making business. We cannot move away from this project because it’s a concession agreement; we are there for 65 years. We also have a minimum equity commitment of 26 percent. We appealed to the Telangana government and they have been kind enough to sanction a soft loan of Rs 3,000 crore into the project. That money will come in over a period of time and once it does, it will go towards repayment of debt which will reduce to Rs 10,000 crore. We have a term sheet with an investor, which I cannot reveal right now because a few conditions and precedents are to be overcome, which will happen shortly. And if that happens, another Rs 4,000 crore of equity money will come into the project. With this, we will come down from 100 percent to 51 percent. If the Rs 4,000 crore investment comes in, the debt of Rs 10,000 crore can be reduced to Rs 6,000 crore. We can also monetise some real estate, which we’ll do shortly. That will reduce debt to nearly Rs 4,000-5,000 crore. We have recently restructured the loan and the interest rate has been brought down from 9.7 percent to 6.2 percent. So with this, whatever can be done financially has been done in the project. We just have to hope that people start going back to office and the project will become cash-flow positive and even viable over a period of time. The best that can be done in Hyderabad Metro is to move it away from the balance sheet by doing an InvIT (infrastructure investment fund) over a period of time, for which we have in-principle permission from the government. It may take two-three years, but we will do that.  What about plans to exit L&amp;amp;T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd (IDPL)?  We have a term sheet with a prominent investor. We have our stake down to 51 percent already. During the course of the year, we will move IDPL away from our balance sheet; it will no longer be an L&amp;amp;T company. It is a work in progress and we’ll announce it as it happens.  What’s the plan for the sale of your only thermal power generation unit, the Nabha power plant in Punjab?  We are talking to an investor and we hope to move the project away from our balance sheet more or less by the end of the year. L&amp;amp;T’s overall debt is Rs 1,24,000 crore, out of that Rs 84,000 crore is from L&amp;amp;T Financial Services, which is not really a debt but their borrowing so that they can lend. So the real debt was Rs 40,000 crore. If Hyderabad Metro’s Rs 13,000 crore debt, Nabha Power’s Rs 6,000 crore debt move away, all we have is debt of Rs 20,000 crore, which is what the working capital requirement of L&amp;amp;T is. We can become a zero debt company by the later part of the year.  L&amp;amp;T’s chairman AM Naik refers to some of the new businesses as “Subrahmanyan’s startups”. What’s the plan with that? And could we potentially see more IPOs (initial public offerings) from the L&amp;amp;T group?  He is a lovely boss. And he has his ways of going about things. We have, with his views on it, started two or three startups within the company. One is L&amp;amp;T EduTech, which is in the higher education space for engineering studies. We started it as a B2B platform, it seems to have done well. We’ve got more than 80,000 students enrolled right now. We will also end up doing professional teaching as well as move into vocational training. It has been received well. It is something unique that we are trying as most of the education startups are in the K10, K-12 and other such spaces. It is the first time we are offering engineering as an e-commerce solution. Second, we have a startup called SuFin, which is for trade of engineering goods between MSMEs, SMEs and medium industries. It is doing sales of Rs 15 crore per month and seems to be doing well. This is again a unique space. Time will tell whether the new initiatives are good startups or where it goes. I hope I can repeat the winning formula.  You announced the much-awaited L&amp;amp;T Infotech-Mindtree merger last week. Since then you have been talking to investors, employees and other stakeholders. From these interactions, do you anticipate any challenges?   There are no challenges. When we acquired Mindtree, you were the first person to pull me up to ask when we were going to merge it (with L&amp;amp;T Infotech). We could not do it at that time because ownership issues had to be settled at the company. We did that, we have now grown it. It has come back to 25 percent growth. So it has achieved what it needed to achieve. It also so happened that around the time we took over, Covid happened and Mindtree was big in travel and hospitality, and both sectors went down pretty bad. Now that we have brought it back, it is logical to put the two companies together. To have two IT companies, which have more or less the same offerings but in different sectors, was not the right way to go forward beyond a point of time. The L&amp;amp;T Infotech and Mindtree merged entity will have a very positive effect on clients as they will be able to source solutions from the same organisation.  You have a presence across the supply chain in the power sector. Looking at the looming power crisis in the country, and the steps announced by the government so far, do you have any suggestions on what can be done to resolve the issue?  I think the government is doing the right thing. Coal-fired has become a bad word across the globe and COP26 and other sustainability criteria are coming in very heavily. I think we are already taking steps which are late, we need to take these steps in a very, very hurried manner across the globe, not specific to India. India does not have any other resources. Coal is our biggest resource and is available in plenty. But we have shifted our views and we have started putting up more solar, hydrogen, nuclear and such other plants. Power is a very sensitive topic in India; it’s sort of a political animal where a lot of subsidy takes place and the discoms and gencos are not in the best of health. But that’s a subject that needs to be discussed in a different forum. Nothing can be done by me making a request right now. But we are very clear that coal-fired units will slow down from an EPC point of view.  What about your power equipment joint venture with Mitsubishi?  It is a work in progress. It’s not our own decision as we hold 51 percent but we have an excellent relationship with them. We are talking to them, they’re also worried. They also have coal- and gas-powered factories in other parts of the world. So both of us are in a dialogue and if something else comes out of it, we’ll do that. Otherwise, we will have to jointly think of how to take it forward, including making electrolysers and such in those factories.  L&amp;amp;T stands at a juncture where the order book is at a record high and you have so many different businesses across so many geographies, each with its own story. How do you divide time between the businesses? What part of your job takes more time?  Once you become a CEO, nobody wants you to be in their business. L&amp;amp;T is run by vertical heads. All my colleagues are fantastic and lovely people, they don’t want me to interfere with their business at all. And they’re doing quite well. So I’m happy coming to the office, having a cup of tea, talking to you and going back! (He says this laughing.)  Then what is motivating you to come to the office every day, what is the most exciting thing right now?  I think one always tries to improve on what one has. It’s a great platform given to us by Mr Naik. The biggest agenda on the mind is to take the platform forward to a higher plane and leave it there when one has to move out from that place. That’s the biggest agenda today. We have a robust strategic plan, which has been extensively discussed within the organisation. The key thing would be to implement this strategy to its subjectivity and spirit to see how to move it forward. As we move forward, the economy gets challenging. There is disruptive, terrific and smarter competition, there’s more entrepreneurial spirit. We need to look at all that and see how we can be more robust, more agile, entrepreneurial and aggressive in our way of business. That takes a lot of time. I think the other important thing is to develop talent. To achieve our strategic plan and be a Rs 2.73 lakh crore organisation by 2026, we need a huge amount of talent within the organisation. I spend a lot of time mentoring people, talking to people, even recruiting people. This is probably the single biggest chance and opportunity that I have to develop the right set of leaders from a succession point of view. That’s very, very important. And Mr Naik, some of my colleagues and I spend a lot of time on it. The third is technology. I think we need to be abreast with what’s happening globally in technology. We have taken some steps towards it by being in touch with many of our peers and competition, consultants and even world leaders. We believe we’re doing the right thing, time will tell, but that’s the way to look at it. It’s a very positive feeling. We are sitting on a good order backlog and, therefore, there’s no desperation about anything. It’s an engineering company where we get up in the morning, rising up to challenges. We hope to become a technology solution provider of eminence in the near future, and that’s where the platform is moving.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/interview-with-eyes-on-revenue-of-rs-2-74-lakh-crore-by-fy26-lt-will-execute-strategic-plan-to-focus-on-core-technology-and-talent-ceo-8504781.html

","Engineering major Larsen and Toubro Ltd has given a guidance of 12-15 percent growth in order inflow and revenue for 2022-23 after a challenging year, which was marred by orders deferments and pressure on margin due to disruptions caused by Covid and geopolitical events, the management told reporters on May 12.  The company also said that it is ready with its five-year strategic plan, namely 'Lakshya’26', that chalks out a path for future value creation for its stakeholders.  “We look at FY23 with hope and optimism. We think both the revenues and the order inflow would increase between 12 and 15 percent,” Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman said in a press briefing.  L&amp;amp;T’s FY22 order inflow grew by 10 percent and revenue rose 15 percent, while it had earlier guided that both may have “low-to-mid teens” growth rate.  While cost headwinds and delay in claim certification in projects and manufacturing businesses impacted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin in the fourth quarter, the company expects some revival going ahead.  “We do expect to recoup some amount of that 100 basis points margin that declined during the year. So as against possibly 9.1 percent EBITDA level, maybe it will go up to about 9.5. It will be our endeavor to get there,” Raman said.  For the fiscal ended March, the company’s EBITDA margin declined to 9.2 percent from 11.5 percent a year ago.  The CFO also said that L&amp;amp;T sees a potential order pipeline worth Rs 8 lakh crore- Rs 9 lakh crore. L&amp;amp;T reported its highest ever consolidated order book at Rs 357,595 crore as on March 31, 2022, with international orders having a share of 27 percent.  On May 12, L&amp;amp;T reported a 10 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 3,621 crore, which was below analysts' expectations. The infrastructure giant's consolidated revenue from operations rose 10 percent on-year to Rs 52,851 crore for the reported quarter, missing analysts' expectations. Profit was estimated at Rs 3,950 crore on revenue of Rs 53,100 crore for the quarter, according to the average estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.  The Year Gone By  Infrastructure segment, L&amp;amp;T’s largest business, witnessed a decline in order inflow of 9 percent year-on-year to Rs 93,515 crore.  “The speed with which bids were put out and awards were given in the prior year, where the government and all the agencies and sponsors of projects were very keen to revive the economy from the direct impact of COVID, has seen a certain slowdown because of the other global events during the current year,” Raman said.  “The markets have been in a churn– liquidity and interest rates have been shifting– so many of the targeted orders that we were expected to win in the current year have got deferred to the following year,” he said, adding that he sees these orders as an “event postponed.”  The hydrocarbon business had a “bumper year,” according to the management. Almost 80 percent of the orders that the company won in the segment were from international markets.  L&amp;amp;T’s power segment, which does engineering, procurement and construction jobs for primarily the conventional power sector, remained subdued for the year ended March. “We are trying to, like many in the sector, migrate from black energy to green energy. The opportunities that are available for coal and gas EPC are limited,” Raman said.  He said that the heavy engineering segment endured a “very difficult year” as due to the volatility in commodity prices, much of the projects got deferred.  Way ahead  L&amp;amp;T undertakes 5-year plans to revisit the group’s strategy and work towards growth. After suspending work on the new strategic plan due to the disruptions caused by Covid, the company has finalized the new plan and is calling it 'Lakshya’26'.  Raman said that the group has identified some major strategic pillars to focus on as core operations and will exit some non-core operations. He said L&amp;amp;T will aim to undertake “very targeted selective bidding, and razor sharp execution”.  The group aims to expand the size and scale of its information technology and technology services portfolio. The company will incubate digital offerings in data centers, tech education and business-to-business e-commerce. It also has plans to invest in the new areas of green energy. “Aggressive plans are on to unlock value of its current investment in few non-core areas such as the concessions space,” the company said.

On April 4, the three companies announced the setting up of a joint venture that will focus on developing green hydrogen projects and related projects for ammonia and methanol, in line with the likely targets under the National Hydrogen Mission.  “The JV intends to play a significant role in helping India achieve the Net Zero Carbon target by 2070, set at COP26 set by Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Sumant Sinha, chairman and chief executive officer ReNew Power said in an email response to Moneycontrol's query.  India aims to derive around 40 percent of its hydrogen demand by 2030 from green hydrogen, which is considered emission-free as it uses renewable energy for electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen molecules. India’s estimated demand for hydrogen is seen at 12 metric million tonnes (MMT) by 2030.  Last year on Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the ‘National Hydrogen Mission’ from the Red Fort with the ambition to boost the growth of green hydrogen in the country to work towards being energy independent. In February, the government announced the first part of the National Hydrogen Mission policy on green hydrogen and green ammonia, aimed to boost production of hydrogen and ammonia using renewable energy.  Industry is hopeful that the second part of the policy would be announced before end-April.  “We hope the government focuses on demand creation through consumption obligations, dollar-denominated contracts, the rationalisation of taxes and duties, and carbon pricing,” Sinha said, commenting on his expectations from the second phase of the policy.  IOCL is setting up green hydrogen plants at its refineries in Mathura and Panipat to replace carbon-emitting units. IOC Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya had said in a statement that the joint venture will first work on these two units.  Refiners, along with steel and fertilizer makers, are among the biggest consumers of hydrogen which is thus far derived from fossil fuel-based technologies.  Other companies such as Reliance Industries, Adani group, Greenko, and state run Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), GAIL (India) Ltd and NTPC Ltd are also keen to enter the green hydrogen supply chain. While they are upbeat about the announcements in the first part, they are awaiting more clarity on the second part of the policy. Minister of Power and New &amp;amp; Renewable Energy RK Singh earlier said that the second phase of the much-awaited policy is under consideration by the central government’s expenditure finance committee.

The intensifying war between Ukraine and Russia, and climbing oil prices to a decade high spooked markets during the week. Weak third-quarter GDP numbers and February auto sales data also weighed on the sentiment.  The Nifty50 fell 2.5 percent or 413 points to 16,245 during the week, the lowest closing level since August 6. The index has formed a bearish candle on the weekly scale and, considering the current war situation, the index falling below 16,000 amid current elevated volatility can be possible in the short term before getting bottomed out, but in case that happens then that would be great buying opportunity, experts feel.  &quot;Although such war scenarios are always tricky, we can clearly see a negative trend on the weekly time-frame charts,&quot; said Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One.  In addition, the falling slope of RSI-smoothened oscillator is an indication of further weakness. So, though the Nifty has reached the initial target of 16,200, we do not want to pre-empt a near-term bottom here, he says, adding 16,000–15,900 is to be seen as an immediate support, while on the higher side, 16,450, followed by 16,600, will be strong resistances.  &quot;Looking at the war situation, we will not be surprised to see the Nifty enter sub-16,000 terrain, but we do not expect the index to slip below 15,500–15,200, as of now,&quot; Chavan said.  From an investor's point of view, he feels this is certainly an excellent opportunity to bag quality stocks in a staggered manner but for traders, it will be difficult to say that worse is behind.  Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on March 4 closing prices.  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Hindalco Industries: Buy | LTP: 583.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 660 | Return: 13 percent  The stock had spent a lot of time below the Rs 550 level. On the decisive break of Rs 550, the stock is set to move towards Rs 660 in the near future.  On Friday, the stock corrected at Rs 580 after hitting a high of Rs 619. As the trend is strong, we need to buy on each of the major support with a stop-loss at Rs 550.    Jindal Steel and Power: Buy | LTP: 435.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 420 | Target: Rs 470-500 | Return: 15 percent  The stock is forming a double bottom formation. Our view is that the stock is moving towards a low of Rs 470. It is available at Rs 435, which is the major support for the stock and if Rs 475 is decisively crossed then we can also see Rs 500 levels which was its previous level high.  In short, the stock is gaining momentum and the strategy should be to add long positions at each of the major support. To keep the long position safe, we need to place a tight stop-loss at Rs 420.    ACC: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,010.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,050 | Target: Rs 1,900-1,850 | Return: 8 percent  The stock has broken the key Rs 2,000 support, above which it has spent more than 9 months. This is a decisive breakdown.  The stock is trending lower according to the Directional Moving Index Oscillator (DMI), suggesting that we should have a seller at each resistance. The broad formation of the stock is between Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,975. Place a stop-loss at Rs 2,050.    Expert: Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities  Birlasoft: Buy | LTP: Rs 437.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 380 | Target: Rs 485-510 | Return: 16 percent  After making high of Rs 585 on January 10, 2022, the stock has fallen and touched the level of Rs 380 on February 24, 2022. Afterwards, the stock is continuously forming higher highs &amp;amp; higher lows in last few trading sessions &amp;amp; has successfully close above 10 &amp;amp; 20 EMA (exponential moving average).  Also, on daily charts, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) crosses above its signal line which qualifies bullish trend in stock while on weekly charts, a bullish Engulfing pattern is formed. Hence, we believe that stock is poised for upside rally with medium term target of Rs 510.    Tips Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,090.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,800 | Target: Rs 2,450-2,610 | Return: 25 percent  On daily chart, MACD crosses above its signal line which qualifies bullish trend in stock while on weekly chart, stock has formed strong base at around Rs 1,800 level.  Any sustainable close above Rs 2,270 will bring further strength in stock and lead the price movement upwards towards Rs 2,450-2,600 level. Hence, we believe that stock is medium term buy opportunity with possible price targets of Rs 2,450-2,610.    Expert: Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities  Wipro: Buy | LTP: Rs 575.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 555 | Target: Rs 610 | Return: 6 percent  The stock has surpassed the crucial resistance of its 20-day EMA. There has been series of positive divergences registered on the daily RSI oscillator, which shows the accumulation in the stock.

lt,2022-02-02T13:19:49+05:30,Rachita Prasad,"Interview | Budget plan implementation, faster dispute mechanism key to infrastructure growth: L&amp;T CFO ",Larsen &amp; Toubro’s Shankar Raman says dispute resolution will be a factor in the infrastructure sector’s progress     ,"The Union Budget will boost the order pipeline for the infrastructure sector, but the pace of implementation and execution of the big-bang capital expenditure plan announced by the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 will be key to success, said R Shankar Raman, chief financial officer of Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Limited (L&amp;amp;T).  Some ongoing issues in the infrastructure sector, like dispute resolution and pace of ordering, need to be addressed to help the industry accelerate growth, Raman told Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad.  Raman also spoke about the opportunities and risks and how L&amp;amp;T is preparing for 2022-23. Pushing project execution, managing people and closing the divestment of its non-core assets is on the top of the agenda for the engineering giant. Edited excerpts:  The Union Budget made a big commitment to capex. What is your key takeaway for the infrastructure sector?   The Rs 7.5 lakh crore is generous. The good part of the allocation is that they've chosen sectors where there is likelihood of a multiplier effect in terms of job generation, distributed income, earning potential, etc.  They have focused on transportation sector, like on transit-oriented cargo terminals, logistics parks. These are all connected projects and they are linear; this will take employment generation to different corners of the country. The Finance Minister spoke about renewable energy, water and housing, which are important issues from the political point of view common man's needs as well as development as more of these centres are coming up. While no specific tax incentive exists today, (with) the inclusion of data centres and energy storage systems, financing these projects will become easier.  Except for the removal of the surcharge on long-term capital gains, which is good in a way, they've have kept the tax structure stable. This is a good strategy because one moving part in the entire investment and return on investment gets addressed if the tax regime is stable. That in a way adds to the attractiveness of the infrastructure sector from a capital attraction point of view.  The most telling thing about the viability of these investments doing well is the thrust on manufacturing. Today, one of our biggest constraints is logistics—moving goods to the market of a manufacturing unit. The thrust to defence, manufacturing, electronics, telecom equipment, solar modules, will improve the viability of these transport and logistics projects. If there is traffic movement of goods, it will justify the investments. Often investors look at these investments which are perceived as good, but the viability is so long-term that only pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are able to invest.  Also read: Budget 2022 | Government strikes a fine balance between growth and fiscal consolidation  India needs to invest $1.4 trillion by 2024-25 on infrastructure to achieve $5 trillion gross domestic product. The Budget spoke about capex, infrastructure, and even climate financing but did not give specifics. Where will the financing come from?   The numbers are suggesting almost Rs 15 lakh crore for financing. The tax collection is expected to be robust. They are also talking about allocating almost Rs. 1 lakh crore to the states for them to participate because they now realize that some of these projects cannot get stuck at state boundaries, they need to flow to  the natural destinations. It's important to get states on their side and get projects on track. All this is going to possibly going to come from the Rs 15 lakh crore gross market borrowing that they mentioned, and also the sovereign green bonds. But clearly the financing has taken a backseat and they have put the end-use first. If the economy grows the way they are projecting it, if tax collection continues to be robust, if the market continues to be attractive, then funding would be available through market borrowing or FII remittances.  Also read: Budget 2022: FM focuses on speeding up cargo movement, improving logistics network  What are the risks to this plan?   The biggest risk in this is implementation. In the past, too, we have always had decent announcements, but the ability to follow through and implement has been our biggest challenge. Secondly, with so much money mobilization, interest rates are at a risk. If interest rates rise, then they puncture the viability of the project. Finally, all these projects require steel, cement and other commodities, the supply of which are constrained as it is. With additional demand for all this due to the additional capex, there will be a need to manage the supply-side; otherwise inflation will spiral and to that extent, assets will become uncompetitive. These three items are risks to this plan—implementation that includes ability to find the money, interest rates and inflation. If they are able to manage this, this budget could be the much-needed dose for sustainable growth. Because of last year’s base effect, growth looks attractive. But when you talk about the next year on the basis of the current year's estimated growth, unless the implementation plan is solid, there could be issues in terms of handling the expectations.  As the largest infrastructure company in the country, what are the opportunities and challenges for the sector now?   We had said after our financial result last week (that) the project pipeline looks good, the pipeline even without this budget announcement. That was based on what activity we saw around. The budget announcements give further emphasis on investment and growth through investment. It makes the pipeline more certain for a longer period of time than it was before the budget. But how much of that is going to be put into smaller programs, when will it be rolled out, timing of bids, conversion of bids to order—this needs to be seen. The biggest challenge is to complete the whole cycle from bidding to awarding quickly. If it happens as briskly as it did in 2020, then we could even see the benefit of all these investments within the budget period.  Also read: Budget 2022 opens coffers wide for road, rail investments  L&amp;amp;T is seen as a proxy of India’s infrastructure story as you have a presence across sectors. What are the growth drivers now and would you revisit plans after the budget?   We have been pitching out tent in all the areas of infrastructure. We were not sure about the sizing of our defence business because we were not sure how much preference would be given to domestic manufacturing. There seems to be a little more definitive direction towards that. So now we will have to see how much we are able to deliver from our factories; it’s a good development.  We have been talking about energy storage as part of this energy transition, and electrolysers, etc. The budget gives attention to these segments on a national level so that will help in firming up the plans. The benefit out of this budget will be seen over a two-three year period if we are able to sustain. They continue to talk about projects like river interlinking, but that requires consensus with the states. These could take more time and have long-term prospects. But the rest of the areas that have been talked about are all workable. But if we are looking at a private-public partnership model for financing projects, we need to ensure these projects are more viable. The PPP projects in the past did not contain sufficient relief measures for dispute resolution, speed of clearances, right of way, etc.  The government announced National Monetisation Pipeline last year but the Union Budget did not specify the plans for it…   I don’t know where the asset monetisation plan figures in this. The budget spoke about kilometres of expressways, but are we planning to finance it by divesting some developed assets? They have not made that clear.  But would L&amp;amp;T be looking at these assets if they came up for sale?   No, we will not looking at it at all. We are watching this space because asset monetization would pump liquidity into the industry, and to that extent new programmes would get financing. We are interested in engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects and we are looking at it only from the point of availability of liquidity with our customers.  The other thing the budget did not touch talk much about was the thermal power sector. L&amp;amp;T’s power business has been a laggard due to the challenges in the sector, what do you make of this budget?   The Economic Survey very clearly talks about fossil fuel; how it continues to be relevant and we can’t scrap it overnight to switch to renewables. The budget is very silent on this. Our belief is that the desulphurisation of existing power projects will continue, but we don’t expect any major EPC order for a new thermal capacity asset. But if India is going to grow at the pace at which it's predicted, I wouldn't be surprised if some thermal capacity addition comes about. While solar projects take only 18 months to come up, it requires a lot of land and then the cost of modules continue to be high. The government will have to revisit some conditions to give confidence to developers that power purchase agreements will be honoured.  Dispute resolution continues to be challenge for the industry with many projects stuck in arbitration. What more can be done?   Of late, there is a movement to settle cases outside of court. But that works well only when the two parties are equals; the government is not really an equal party. The conciliation becomes difficult when the other party has a more powerful position at the table. The arbitration has some ticking timelines, but conciliation is open-ended. If a plan has been implemented we have to respect time; interest during the construction itself can make it unviable. Speed is money.  After the second quarter of FY2022, you sounded more confident of achieving you sales and order inflow targets for the year than how you did last week after the third quarter. Should we be worried that an industry bellwether like L&amp;amp;T is not as confident on execution and implementation?   Things are improving with every quarter. We have hit a good season now in terms of weather conditions and festival season getting over. We get an uninterrupted run of about six months, till about June. This is possibly the best period for execution of projects and planning budgets. There is always the pressure to execute more projects faster because ultimately the order book has to be converted to sales, profits and cash. The turnover of people is very high, managing people movement is a challenge. But we were far more worried this time last year as compared to where we are right now.  Does that mean this is the best time for mobilization of people? No, we have seen better times but we are moving forward.

The second priority is to ensure that the non-core assets exit that we have been working on gets completed. The third priority, we catch up with our commitment to the plan; we have to make sure working capital stays disciplined and money management has to remain intact. And finally, we have to manage talent, some of the businesses in our portfolios like IT (information technology), IT-enabled services and financial services have a lot of attrition, so we have to manage that well. Of course inflation is always an important factor to manage.  L&amp;amp;T have identified the Hyderabad Metro project for divestment. You have been in talks with the government to reduce the stress on the projects due to Covid19 disruptions. What is the status of the plans for this project?   Every month is two steps forward; we are definitely making headway. We refinanced the loan in December, that is giving us a saving of Rs 300 crore – 400 crore on interest payment. Now we're trying to restructure the capital so that the debt level comes down in the project. So sometime in the course of this calendar year we will be able to mention what exactly we're doing to make this project not such an overhang that it has been. Ultimately, what will help is people commuting on it, which has been disrupted by the pandemic.  When do you expect to close the divestment of L&amp;amp;T’s infrastructure development arm, IDPL?   We are working on the divestment process to exit it. We are hoping against hope that we will be able to close the process.

Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro on January 28 reported a 17 percent on-year decline in its consolidated net profit to Rs 2,055 crore for the quarter ended December 2021.  The decline in the bottomline is largely on account of a higher base in the year-ago quarter which included the sale of commercial property in the realty business and gain on divestment from discontinued operations of the electrical and automation business.  The country's largest infrastructure company, however, reported an 11 percent on-year growth in consolidated revenues to Rs 39,563 crore during the quarter in review.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after the December quarter earnings:  Jefferies  Broking house Jefferies has maintained 'buy' call on the stock but cut the target price to Rs 2,675 from Rs 2,845 as the Q3 EBITDA was 5 percent below expectations as E&amp;amp;C revenue execution rose 9 percent YoY.  The order flow disappointed at 9MFY22, slips 5 percent YoY, while 13-17 percent YoY FY22 order flow growth guidance was maintained.  The broking house believes H2FY22 has triggers of guidance being met.  JPMorgan  The research firm has kept 'overweight' call and cut the target to Rs 2,160 from Rs 2,300. The prospects, execution outlook appear solid, despite Q3 miss, it said.  The long-awaited growth pick-up versus muted orders may weigh on the stock in the near term.  JPMorgan is positive on its growth outlook, free cash potential and strategic initiatives.  Citi  The brokerage house has maintained the 'buy' call with a target at Rs 2,460 as the Q3 was in-line and strong order inflow prospects for Q4.  The Q3 underline a healthy ordering environment along with the ability to win orders. The prospect pipeline for Q4 is at a multi-year high at Rs 3.9 lakh crore.  The stock is attractively priced and it remains the top pick, said Citi.  Credit Suisse  The research house has maintained the 'outperform' call on the stock with a target at Rs 2,450.  It revised the FY22/23/24 EPS estimates to Rs 68/93/114 from Rs 77/99/119. The upside could originate from lower interest cost and asset sales/restructuring.  Kotak Institutional Equities  The brokerage house has kept the 'buy' call with a target at Rs 2,450 after in-line print with strength in IT business covering for weakness in core business margin.  Improving refinancing of Hyderabad Metro debt boosts prospects of medium-term returns.  Kotak Institutional Equities cut core business estimates by 4 percent and retain target on higher value of IT business.  Prabhudas Lilladher  The research house believes that L&amp;amp;T is well-placed to benefit from a pickup in economic activity and private capex given its financial, technical and managerial capability for sustaining and gaining market share.  It has cut the earnings estimate for the company by 4 percent for FY22 factoring in lower margins and other income, while kept it unchanged for FY23/24.  &quot;We roll over our target price to FY24E with a ‘buy’ rating and revise target price to Rs 2,382 (Rs 2,201 earlier),&quot; it said.  Sharekhan  Healthy operational performance despite supply chain challenges, a strong rise in order prospects for Q4FY2022 along with retaining guidance related to execution, order intake, OPM and working capital for FY2022 are key positives from the Q3FY2022 results.  International outlook looks buoyant with a pick-up in crude oil prices.  On the longer term, L&amp;amp;T remains at the forefront to reap benefits from the AtmaNirbhar Bharat Scheme with its diversified businesses across sectors such as defence, infrastructure, heavy engineering, and IT.  The company remains the best proxy for domestic capex and an improving business environment. &quot;We maintain a 'buy' rating on the stock with a revised SOTP-based price target (PT) of Rs 2,270 factoring upwardly revised valuation of its key IT&amp;amp;ES subsidiaries and favourable core business valuation,&quot; it said.  Motilal Oswal  We maintain our earnings estimate, but decrease our target price to R 2,165/share (Rs 2,295 earlier), to account for MTM of listed subsidiaries’ CMP (holding company discount of 20%) and an unchanged target P/E multiple of 20x for the core business.  The analysis firm estimates an FY21-24E EPS CAGR of 25 percent, led by 15 percent CAGR in the core E&amp;amp;C business and reducing losses from the Hyderabad Metro.  &quot;Should the stock revert to its historical average trading multiple of 22x, our target price for the stock will increase to Rs 2,285.

The company’s consolidated revenues in the December quarter was Rs 39,563 crore, up 11 percent, reflecting an improvement in execution of infrastructure projects and robust growth in its information technology (IT) and services businesses.  The company announced its result after bourses closed for trading. Shares of the company closed at Rs 1898.80 on Friday, down 0.65 percent from the previous close. L&amp;amp;T missed street estimates for earnings. A Moneycontrol poll of five brokerages pegged the company's consolidated net profit at Rs 2,185 crore on revenues of Rs 39,687 crore for the reported quarter.  PROFIT DECLINES  L&amp;amp;T’s net other income almost halved from Rs 1,065 crore a year ago to Rs 571 crore in the December quarter.  Raman said that L&amp;amp;T had raised funds to be prepared for the pandemic on liquidity concerns. This money was parked in treasury instruments where the company made substantial gains. As the concerns around the pandemic’s impact on business eased, the company reduced the debt which in turn reduced the investible surplus and led to a reduction in other income reduced.  He said that the company paid back Rs 10,000 crore of debt in the quarter, most of which was raised a year ago for safeguarding the business in the pandemic.  “From operations, we are ahead of the previous quarter. From treasury operations, there is a dip. Consequently, before extraordinary items and before discontinued business, we have a drop of Rs 200 crore in net profit which is a 9 percent decline,” Raman said.  The decline in profit widened because of the higher base effect. While the significant part of the proceeds from the divestment of its electrical and automation business to Schneider Electric was booked in the second quarter of 2020-21, some part of it had been booked in the third quarter.  “There was a tail effect of that transaction into quarter three which generated Rs 200 crore of profit (in Q3FY21),” Raman said.  ORDER BOOK AND PIPELINE  L&amp;amp;T reported a 31 percent year-on-year decline in new orders in the December quarter at Rs 50,359 crore; attributing it to a high base in the same quarter a year ago as it then bagged its biggest ever engineering, procurement and construction contract for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project.  The share of international orders, primarily from the Middle East, was 40 percent of the total order inflow. L&amp;amp;T’s consolidated order book was at its highest at Rs 340,365 crore as on end-December, of which 24 percent were international orders. The orderbook is executable over the next three-four years.  “We keep refreshing the pipeline every quarter to update it with deletions and additions. Based on the projects in various sectors, the pipeline adds up to close to four lakh crore rupees,” Raman said.  GUIDANCE  While L&amp;amp;T management is upbeat about the visibility of a robust order pipeline, they have concerns over timelines.  “There is always a big question mark about the timing. This is something that is uncontrollable from our end. What we can possibly do is position ourselves competitively, respond to that come up and hope to maintain the strike rate of 15-20 percent that we have historically had,” the CFO said.  In October, while announcing the result of Q2FY22, Raman had said that L&amp;amp;T was confident that it will meet its FY22 guidance of up to a low-to-mid teens growth in orders and revenues.  “There is a reasonable chance that we should still have a fighting chance to move towards the way we thought the year will be at the beginning of the year. We said anywhere in low-to-mid teens, not mid-teens,” he said.  KEY SEGMENT PERFORMANCE  L&amp;amp;T’s core business, its infrastructure segment, recorded third-party revenues of Rs 18,345 crore for the December quarter, up 16 percent on the back of a good pick up in execution momentum of its large value orders. The company managed to increase earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBIDTA) margin by almost 100 basis points to 7.1 percent due to tapering of certain stressed jobs and overall higher site productivity despite the impact of higher material procurement costs, the company said.  Power segment business remained muted and the company won no new projects as fossil fuel-based power projects continue to lose favour among investors.  Heavy engineering business saw a spurt of orders in refinery and oil and gas business, even as revenue and profit margin on exiting jobs declined.  The defence engineering segment reported a decline in revenue due to tapering of execution of jobs in progress in the shipbuilding business.  The hydrocarbon segment reported revenues of Rs 4,880 crore during the quarter ended December, up 11 percent on year with peaking of execution activities in the onshore domestic vertical, but it won few new orders than the same quarter last year.  Its IT and Technology Services segment, which includes L&amp;amp;T Infotech, L&amp;amp;T Technology Services and Mindtree continued to grow on a surge in demand for more technology focused offerings.  L&amp;amp;T’s financial services business, which includes the listed subsidiary L&amp;amp;T Finance Holdings, reported a decline in revenue attributed to targeted reduction in the overall loan book.  ROAD AHEAD  L&amp;amp;T said that divestments of non-core businesses would continue to be a priority. Raman said that the company is working towards closing the transactions soon despite the macroeconomic uncertainties.  The company will also “aggressively” pursue return ratios to create sustainable long-term returns for shareholders.  “During the quarter the company reaffirmed its commitment to integrate its environmental, social and corporate governance goals with business targets and is working towards becoming a ‘Net Zero’ company,” L&amp;amp;T stated.

As per the memorandum of understanding, L&amp;amp;T and HydrogenPro will jointly work towards setting up of a gigawatt-scale manufacturing unit for alkaline water electrolyzers based on HydrogenPro technology. In December, L&amp;amp;T tied up with Nasdaq-listed ReNew Power to jointly develop, own, execute and operate green hydrogen projects in India.  The planned joint venture in India is a part of L&amp;amp;T’s strategy to expand its presence across the green energy value chain. It will help HydrogenPro establish a global manufacturing footprint to maintain cost leadership and ensure local presence.  “The energy industry is undergoing a tectonic shift with green hydrogen emerging as a key fuel in the future energy basket…This will be a win-win partnership given our extensive relationship across the energy industry, deep EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) experience in this sector and successful ongoing collaborations with many MNCs and HydrogenPro’s focus to stay ahead of the curve as far as technology leadership is concerned,” SN Subrahmanyan, chief executive officer and managing director of L&amp;amp;T was quoted as saying in the statement.  Billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani are betting on green hydrogen too and their respective groups are looking at technology partnerships to bring the new technology to India for mass production.  In October last year, Reliance Industries, through its unit Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd (RNESL) signed a pact with Danish company Stiesdal A/S for hydrogen electrolyzer, as part of a strategy to expand its clean energy portfolio through partnerships. The Adani Group has said that it aims to be one of the largest green hydrogen producers in the world and has plans to invest with potential partners for electrolyzer manufacturing in the country.  ‘Green hydrogen’ is pitched to be the next big thing in the global energy market, as it derives energy from hydrogen produced by splitting water using renewable electricity. While the technology is still at an early stage, energy majors across the world are eyeing it as it can provide large-scale energy through a completely clean process. The process requires electrolyzers for splitting water into elemental oxygen and hydrogen.  Technology companies, especially in Europe and US, have been working on commercial production of green hydrogen. India provides the scale that can help them reduce costs.  “We’re extremely pleased to enter this Memorandum of Understanding with L&amp;amp;T, an E&amp;amp;C powerhouse which is the perfect partner to establish HydrogenPro in the Indian market, a huge and growing energy market with tremendous potential for hydrogen-based solutions,” said Elling Nygaard, CEO of HydrogenPro.  Green Hydrogen demand in India is estimated to grow up to two million ton per year by 2030 in line with the nation’s Green Hydrogen Mission, which estimates an investments of over $60 billion in the sector.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/lt-ties-up-with-norwegian-company-for-electrolyzer-technology-to-push-green-hydrogen-plans-7991831.html

lt,2022-01-03T10:24:53+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Top 12 trading ideas for January series as market keeps a watch on Omicron,"Sameet Chavan of Angel One says Traders should trade with a positive bias as long as the index remains above 17,000–16,800","The market wound up the last week of 2021 on a high amid low volumes and also had a strong start to the January series on December 31.  The Nifty climbed above 17,300 to close at its highest level since December 13, up 2 percent in the week ended December 31, forming a bullish candle on the weekly as well as the daily charts.  The rally was broad-based and the index concluded the year with 24 percent gains. Experts expect the rally to continue in the coming days and the Nifty at 17,400-17,500. If the index stabilises around these levels, a sharp rally can't be ruled out.  &quot;As a conservative trader, one can wait for a sustainable close above 17,400, which is the higher end of the ‘Downward Sloping Channel' on the daily chart. But the way individual stocks are behaving, it is likely to happen in the coming session only,” said Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One. After this, the immediate levels to watch out for would be 17,550–17,700, he said.  On the flip side, the base shifted to 17,000–16,800 before which 17,150 was considered the key support.  Traders should trade with a positive bias as long as the index remains above the mentioned base.  Here are experts' top 12 trading ideas for the January series. Returns are based on the December 31 closing prices:  Expert | Nandish Shah, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities  JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,779.70 | Stoploss: Rs 1,670 | Target: Rs 1,960 | Return: 10 percent  The stock price has broken out from the downward sloping trendline on the daily chart. The short-term trend is positive as the stock is trading above its 5 and 20-day exponential moving average (EMA).  The relative strength index (RSI) and money flow index (MFI) oscillators are placed above 60 and rising upwards, indicating strength in the uptrend.  Plus directional indicator (DI) is trading above -DI, while average directional index (ADX) line is placed above 25, yet another indicator of momentum in the uptrend.    Vidhi Specialty Food Ingredients: Buy | LTP: Rs 395.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 375 | Target: Rs 440 | Return: 11 percent  The stock price has broken out from the symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. The short-term trend remains strong as it is trading above all its important short-term moving averages.  RSI and MFI oscillator are placed above 60 and rising upwards, indicating strength in the current uptrend. Plus DI is trading above -DI ,while ADX line is placed above 25, indicating momentum in the current uptrend.    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Dr Lal PathLabs: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,822.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,670 | Target: Rs 4,060 | Return: 6.2 percent  The stock has been consolidating within a broad range for the last three months. During this consolidation, prices formed a support base around Rs 3,300 and have seen buying interest there.  On daily charts, the stock has given a breakout above a falling trendline resistance of the consolidation and this should lead to buying interest in the stock in the short term.  In the last month if we analyse the volume action along with price moves, volumes were good on price up move and low during correction, which is a positive sign.  Hence, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 3,820-3,800 for a potential target of Rs 4,060. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 3,670 on long positions.    ONGC: Buy | LTP: Rs 142.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 136 | Target: Rs 152 | Return: 6.74 percent  After an impulsive up move till October, prices entered a corrective phase within an uptrend and have been trading in a channel. While the volumes were good during price upmove, the corrections were not backed by higher volumes which is a positive sign.  From the support end of the channel, the stock has witnessed some buying interest and prices have given a breakout above its swing high on the lower time frame chart.  We expect the stock to rally towards the higher end of the channel in the near term. In the long-term charts, we anticipate a breakout in this leg of up move.  Hence, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 142-140 for potential targets of Rs 149 and 152. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 136 on long positions.    Hindalco Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 475.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 455 | Target: Rs 510 | Return: 7.2 percent  The metal space has witnessed a decent correction in the last couple of months. The longer time frame charts of many of the metal stocks indicate that this is just a corrective phase within an uptrend and certain stocks could see good buying interest along with the market momentum.  Within this sector, Hindalco witnessed a good buying interest on December 31 and the stock has given a breakout from its immediate resistance. The volumes were good, indicating follow-up buying interest. The RSI oscillator is indicating a positive momentum.  Hence, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 475-470 for potential targets of Rs 500-510 in the short term. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 455 on long positions.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities  NALCO: Buy | LTP: Rs 101 | Stop-Loss: Rs 95 | Target: Rs 115 | Return: 14 percent  The stock is above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) support and above the equilibrium level of Rs 100. The performance of the stock is good compared to the weakness in the index. The stock trend is positive and has been building a series of higher top higher bottoms since November 2021.  Depending on the short and medium-term charts, traders and investors should buy stocks at current levels. Keep the final stoploss at Rs 95. On the upside, the chances of going to Rs 108 and Rs 115 are bright.    Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,895.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,800 | Target: Rs 2,050 | Return: 8 percent  It is consolidating above the 50-day SMA. On a monthly basis, it was one of the best-performing stocks, however, due to trading at a crucial retracement level, we saw sideways consolidation.  We should be buyers in the stock at Rs 1,890 and Rs 1,850. However, we need to protect the long positions with a stiff stop loss at Rs 1,800. On the upside, Rs 1,980 and Rs 2,050 would be the biggest hurdles.    Mphasis: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,396.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,200 | Target: Rs 3,660 | Return: 7.75 percent  The stock was in a corrective pattern from Rs 3,660 levels. The range of corrective patterns was between Rs 3,600 and Rs 2,850, which is quite a large. Such type of price correction usually results in the continuation pattern.  Based on the daily chart, it is breaking out of a flag formation and the price is sustaining above the supports of 20 and 50-day averages.  Our strategy should be to buy partially at the current level and keep the balance at Rs 3,250 and for that keep a stop-loss at Rs 3,200. On the upside, the Rs 3,500 and Rs 3,660 would be major resistance.    Expert: Vijay Dhanotiya, Lead of Technical Research at CapitalVia Global Research  Quess Corp: Buy | LTP: Rs 856.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 775 | Target: Rs 1,050 | Return: 22.6 percent  The stock is trading near the lower band of an ascending channel. We expect a reversal from the support of the lower band of the channel. It has also taken a support of EMA 200 line.  We have observed indicators like moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and RSI pointing that the momentum in the stock is likely to continue. We recommend a buy above Rs 865 with a target of Rs 1,050 with a stop-loss of Rs 775.    Sobha: Buy | LTP: Rs 895.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 750 | Target: Rs 1,050 | Return: 17.2 percent  The stock has reversed from the support level near Rs 800. It has taken the support of the lower band of an ascending channel.  We recommend a buy above Rs 875 with a target of Rs 1,050 with a stop loss of Rs 750.    Apollo Hospitals Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,013.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,350 | Target: Rs 6,200 | Return: 24 percent  The stock has reversed from the support of the lower band of an ascending channel. It has also taken the support of 100 EMA.  MACD and RSI indicate that the momentum in the stock is likely to continue. We recommend a buy above Rs 5,050 with a target of Rs 6,200 with a stop loss of Rs 4,350.  Amber Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,316.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,950 | Target: Rs 3,950 | Return: 19 percent  The stock has been trading in a positive manner and reversed from the previous level of Rs 3,250.  It has also taken support of 200 EMA and reversed from the same support level. We recommend a buy above Rs 3,400 with a target of Rs 3,950 with a stop loss of Rs 2,950.

Unless it slips below Rs 1,400, positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 1,650-1,775. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any, between Rs 1,550 and Rs 1,450, with a stop loss below Rs 1,400.  eClerx Services  On November 4, the stock opened with a gap of 10 percent and made a fresh all-time high of Rs 2,470 but again took resistance near Rs 2,400.

And if the stock manages to close above the same, we can expect a quick uptrend rally towards Rs 2,550-2,700. On the flip side, trading below Rs 2,225 may increase further weakness up to Rs 2,100-2,025.

The S&amp;amp;P BSE Sensex rallied 48 percent in the past 12 months and the BSE Capital Goods index jumped 84 percent.  The stock touched a record high of Rs 1,717.90 on the BSE on September 1, gaining 28 percent in the past four-and-half-months.  L&amp;amp;T is an infrastructure conglomerate with interests in engineering, construction, manufacturing, technology and financial services. The company has orders worth more than Rs 3.2 lakh crore (20 percent from overseas), which experts said ensures good revenue visibility for the next few years. The infrastructure segment accounts for 75 percent of its orders.  Order pipeline  The company is one of the major beneficiaries of the government’s capital expenditure push. The government has boosted capital expenditure by 34 percent to Rs 5.5 lakh crore for FY22, with an extra Rs 2 lakh crore set aside by states and autonomous bodies.  “Considering the government’s focus towards economic growth, which will trigger the capex cycle over the next two years followed by private capex, we believe L&amp;amp;T is well-placed to capture those opportunities and will remain the top pick in the capital goods space as a proxy to India’s capex story,” said Jitesh Ranawat, head of institutional sales at Marwadi Shares and Finance.  According to Gaurav Garg, head of research at CapitalVia Global Research, L&amp;amp;T typically wins 20-25 percent of the projects it bids for and has a competitive advantage due to its ability to handle complex projects.  Following its FY21 results, the company said order traction from categories such as metro, railways, roads, expressways, water, renewables and power transmission and distribution are expected to grow. Revenue and order inflows are expected to grow in the low to mid-teens in FY22.  “The tender pipeline for FY22 remains strong, with domestic orders totalling Rs 6.6 lakh crore and international orders at Rs 3 lakh crore, which is a total of Rs 9.5-10 lakh crore. Due to the solid performance of the two segments, infrastructure and hydrocarbon, the company seems to be able to maintain a healthy order book,” said Garg.  Ranawat said L&amp;amp;T’s core engineering &amp;amp; construction business is doing well whereas the building and power segments remained a little weaker in FY21.  “They have also had strong order wins in international power T&amp;amp;D and the hydrocarbons space,” Ranawat said.  Its infrastructure segment revenue grew 63 percent to Rs 10,409 crore in the first quarter of FY22 from a year earlier, while the power business doubled to Rs 759 crore.  Revenue from hydrocarbon projects rose 37 percent to Rs 4,190 crore. Heavy engineering business revenue climbed 45 percent to Rs 548 crore and defence engineering revenue increased 46 percent to Rs 689 crore.  Divestment, Hyderabad metro project  L&amp;amp;T sold its entire stake in L&amp;amp;T Uttaranchal Hydropower to ReNew Power Services for Rs 985 crore in August, in line with its strategy of divesting non-core assets. The hydropower unit operates a 99 MW plant.  Last year, L&amp;amp;T sold its electrical &amp;amp; automation business to Schneider Electric for Rs 14,000 crore. Abhineet Anand of Emkay said Nabha Power will also be divested. Nabha Power runs a 2x700 MW supercritical thermal power plant at Rajpura in Punjab.  L&amp;amp;T’s investment in the Hyderabad Metro Rail has been hampered by cost and time overruns, apart from traffic loss caused by the Covid-19 outbreak.  Recently, media reports indicated the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund was in talks to invest Rs 4,000 crore in the metro project, said Garg. However, Anand noted that L&amp;amp;T has not commented on the matter.  “The company is looking at various options like assistance from the state government, stake sale, monetisation of real estate and refinancing of debt for the Hyderabad metro,” Anand said.  Tendering activity  A preliminary analysis of tendering activity for July and August suggests a YoY improvement, said Anand.  “Tendering, which was down around 14 percent YoY in Q1 of FY22, saw good growth (46 percent YoY) in July and August, leading to YTD growth of around 10 percent YoY. An uptick in roads, railways and water supply has been visible in recent months. We have also seen major states increasing capex in July, after a lukewarm Q1,” he explained.  Anand said L&amp;amp;T (ex-services) had posted an order inflow of Rs 15,100 crore in Q1 of FY22, which was up 10 percent YoY but below Rs 30,000 crore in Q1 of FY20. He said inflows will catch up in the rest of the financial year as tendering improves.  The company won Rs 26,557 crore of orders at the group level in the June quarter, a growth of 13 percent from a year earlier. The orders came from the metro, rural water supply, mineral and metal, residential, power transmission and distribution, power and hydrocarbon offshore sectors.  Earnings  L&amp;amp;T’s consolidated revenue increased 38 percent to Rs 29,335 crore in Q1 of FY22 on healthy execution of projects despite the second wave of Covid-19 affecting operations at many locations. Project progress was impacted by regional lockdowns, shortage of industrial oxygen and supply chain disruptions.  The company posted a consolidated profit of Rs 1,174 crore, almost quadrupling from a year earlier.  Fundamental call  Garg advised investors who have added the stock to their portfolios to hold it for a target of Rs 1,850 in three months and for a target of Rs 2,050 in six months, implying gains of 10-25 percent over the next six months.  Ranawat remains positive on L&amp;amp;T and expects a 20 percent upside from current levels in the next year.  Technical call  On a daily basis, the stock has traded in a channel for the past few years and started forming a broadening pattern in recent months.  “On a weekly basis, if the stock closes above Rs 1,800, then we may expect the stock to go above Rs 2,000-2,100 in the next three to six months,” said Garg.

Eventually, the stock closed 4.19 percent higher at Rs 1,609.05 on BSE.  In the year 2021, the stock has gained 25 percent on BSE, as of July 15, against an 11 percent rally in the Sensex.  L&amp;amp;T is a largecap stock. The company operates in technology, engineering, construction, manufacturing and financial services and has a global presence.  Arafat Saiyed, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities, pointed out that L&amp;amp;T is one of the key beneficiaries of investment upcycle in India.  &quot;The company has sustained its order book with robust order inflow owing to the strong performance of the key segments i.e. infrastructure and hydrocarbon,&quot; he said.  &quot;The plan to exit from development assets especially monetisation of Hyderabad metro is a long-term positive. L&amp;amp;T deserve higher valuation given restart of ordering activity on large multilateral projects, an uptick in investment cycle and healthy subsidiary performance.&quot;  As per brokerage firm JM Financial, L&amp;amp;T expects a strong ordering pipeline for FY22 of Rs 9.6 lakh crore versus Rs 8.5 lakh crore in FY21, split between Rs 6.56 lakh crore domestic and Rs 2.5 lakh crore international worth of works.  &quot;Pipeline is dominated by: (a) infra (77 percent mix) across sector like T&amp;amp;D, heavy civil, water (desalination, pipeline, waste/effluent treatment), metro, solar, data centres, IT capex, and (b) hydrocarbon (16 percent mix) on the back of rising oil prices,&quot; JM Financial said.  &quot;Given L&amp;amp;T’s balance sheet strength, record-high order book, 12 percent higher tender pipeline, management confidence of 13-15 percent growth while maintaining margins, we find that L&amp;amp;T has the advantage of faster execution recovery versus peers,&quot; JM Financial said.  The brokerage firm believes the execution lost in FY21 will be made up in FY22 since several of L&amp;amp;Ts projects are large and important infra projects— airports, bridges, metros, etc— for state and Union governments.  &quot;Many of these projects are also multi-laterally funded, which allows for smooth payment cycles. Hence, we find a sharp jump in FY22 earnings given the low base of FY21. We also believe its arms are also on well-placed which augers well for Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro,&quot; said JM Financial.  The company will release its June-quarter scorecard on July 26 in which it is expected to report a strong set of numbers on a year-on-year (YoY basis. However, on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, the numbers may be subdued.  The numbers may be strong YoY due to the low base as the coronavirus pandemic hit performance in the June quarter of FY21.  Brokerage firm ICICI Direct expects Larsen and Toubro to report net profit at Rs 604 crore, up 114.5 percent YoY, but down 75.5 percent QoQ. Net Sales are expected to increase by 46.1 percent YoY, but down 60 percent QoQ to Rs 11,904.4 crore.  Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a 378.8 percent YoY jump in reported PAT. Revenue may see a jump of 42.4 percent YoY.  &quot;Watch out for ramp-up in execution trends and outlook across various segments.

In case of any dip, the Rs 1,540-1,570 zone would act as a cushion. They should maintain a stop loss at Rs 1,530 for this position,&quot; said Mishra.

The bottomline was ahead of CNBC-TV18 poll estimates which was pegged at Rs 2,110 crore for the quarter.  The profit growth was largely attributed to higher profit from IT a TS segment and sale of commercial property in realty. PAT also included a gain on divestment of Rs 209 crore from discontinued operations for the quarter ended December 2020, towards further adjustments accrued against the sale of the electrical &amp;amp; automation business to Schneider Electric SE and sale of the UK-based Marine control &amp;amp; automation systems subsidiary to Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG, L&amp;amp;T said.  Here are highlights from L&amp;amp;T's Q3 FY20 earnings call compiled by Narnolia Financial Advisors:  The company registered strong order inflow of Rs 1,24,800 crore this quarter on the back of orders from infrastructure and hydrocarbon segments. The order book for the quarter stands at Rs 3,31,000 crore, of which domestic contributes 80 percent while international contributes 20 percent, L&amp;amp;T management said.  Out of the domestic order book of Rs 2,63,700 crore the split includes Central Government (12 percent), State Government (34 percent), PSUs (41 percent) and private (15 percent). Out of this order book, almost around Rs 9,000 crore is multi-lateral funded.  The management expects prospect pipeline of Rs 2,65,000 crore for Q4 FY21, of which, Rs 2,20,000 crore is domestic and the balance is international. Government is focusing on key areas such as Metro/RRTS/HSR High-speed rail, road and expressways, renewables, water and power transmission and distribution to boost recovery.  For 9MFY21, the company’s absolute level of net working capital has shown marginal improvement driven by customer collections. The company endeavours to maintain the same level of networking capital in March 2021 as existed in March 2020, the management said.  The company's Q3 order inflow in infra segment surpassed cumulative order flows in H1FY21 and recorded 22 percent growth in revenue in Q3 on the back of supply chain normalization and workforce availability. There could be volatility in margin ahead depending on job mix, it said.  In the power segment, revenue increase in Q3 was driven from the opening order book. In defence engineering, multiple small value orders replenished opening order book. The recent policy of the government concerning this sector is encouraging, Rs 28,000 crore of the domestic project has been cleared by defence council, however, implementation may happen over a course of time.  The company believes that decline in revenue from developmental projects segment is mainly driven by Nabha Power mainly due to lack of coal supply due to the Rail Roko Agitation in Punjab which affected the power generation for almost a month. Metro margins are impacted by operating expenditure because of under-recovery due to COVID. Current traffic average on weekdays is around 1,25,000-1,30,000 riders per day, the management said.  Margin improvement in IT and technology segment was driven by improved utilization, onshore-offshore mix and operational efficiencies. In financial service segments, PAT de-growth is largely due to enhanced credit cost provisions, it said.  In Q2, the company has announced fund allocation of Rs 2000 crore for Hyderabad Metro out of which Rs 500 crore was infused in Q3. In the next 2-3 quarters, the company expects a decline in standalone debt. Current net debt to equity ratio is 0.1.

The spokesperson added that &quot;our primary focus is to continue operations adhering to safety norms to keep passengers safe,&quot; and did not reveal the exact amount sought.  The Telangana government, itself facing a severe financial crunch, has been keeping mum. The people cited above said the state government is in a bind because it knows that the promoter, L&amp;amp;T, could well attempt to take recourse to the ‘force majeure’ clause in the concession agreement to threaten to walk out of the project in the case of unforeseen events.  Hyderabad Metro can invoke the clause to not abide by the terms of the agreement in the case of unforeseen events as defined under the section on force majeure. However, there is a catch: the metro was non functional for 169 days and the force majeure clause can be invoked if the metro remained shut for 180 days. This is seen as the reason why it has sought financial assistance instead of taking the force majeure clause.  Unlike Delhi, where the metro lines run partly over ground and partly underground, the metro line in Hyderabad is totally over ground. This is because Hyderabad sits atop the Deccan plateau, where the soil is very rocky and difficult to cut.  Murky past  Hyderabad Metro has been in the thick of controversy from the very beginning. The project was handed over to Maytas, a company floated by Ramalinga Raju of the Satyam accounting scandal in 2008. Raju promised to pay the state government a huge license fee to land the project. Also, while other bidders had sought viability gap funding (VGF), Maytas sought no such funding.  VGF, paid by the central government, was disbursed under the implicit belief that any metro project was loss making but could become profitable with the grant.  Raju, however, felt he would make money selling large tracts of real estate, accumulated around the city, that the planned metro project would end up passing.  However, with Raju’s confession about wrongdoing at Satyam in January 2009, the metro rail project went kaput. It was launched afresh with a new tendering process and L&amp;amp;T won the project.  However, in its hurry to get a new promoter, the state government forgot to change the parameters of the project. “The authorities then were quite excited and overlooked the flaws and let the project pass as it was. They should have reexamined the parameters of the project but failed to,” says a senior secretary to the state government.  L&amp;amp;T has also been granted a VGF of Rs 1,458 crore. Of this, Rs 1,200 crore has already been paid. The VGF is paid by the central government. Additionally real estate was also handed over to the L&amp;amp;T-promoted Hyderabad Metro rail.  Lack of foresight  The Hyderabad metro project was for rail operations across the city on three lines, covering 69.2 km. One of the lines went to the old city of Hyderabad, which went through densely populated areas. This route never took off fully and remained curtailed.  The second line was from Nagole to Hi Tech city. Though metro services on this line run, the problem is about the line’s termination in Hi Tech city. “The city has extended far ahead and the main commercial area is at Gachibowli, ahead of the Hi Tech city. This was quite clear even in 2008 and certainly so when it was rebid. But the lines were not extended,” rued a senior government official.  Now, there is a plan for an extended route to the ‘new’ airport (which came up in 2009). However, this will not be easy to implement considering the ‘urbanisation’ that has taken place near Gachibowli; the route can be extended only by destroying urban structures. This would not have been the case in 2011, when fresh bids were called for the project. The plan has not been put into operation.  So, in the end, it would seem that the Hyderabad Metro has an uncertain future and only concerted thinking by a purpose-driven government can bring it back on the rails.

It is a momentous oscillator used to identify trend reversal. RSI was invented by Welles Wilder Junior. The default look-back period for RSI is 14, however this can be lowered to increase sensitivity or raised to decrease sensitivity. RSI calculates strength of stock trend and helps to predict their reversals.  Why to Buy Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro?  There are a lot of trading strategies using RSI; below mentioned is one of the most popular among trading community which involves buy after completing retracement for higher movement; however support of another momentum oscillator stochastic can give additional support.  In last some days, RSI had given a breakout by trading above 50 levels from below and made a high of 80 then after it is trading lower or retracing towards center line placed at 50 levels, this behaviour is called as 'RSI PBB' setup. RSI PBB is pull back buy setup which indicates, once RSI turns its tail upside after taking support from zone of 45-55 levels, target is previous swing high of RSI which was 70 or previous swing high of prices (Rs 1,025). Currently the L&amp;amp;T is going through this setup and we expect higher price movement towards previous high Rs 1,050-1,075 levels in coming days. Figure .1. RSI PBB setup and Buy signal on L&amp;amp;T Buy Signal  1. Recent RSI gave a breakout and published swing top around 70 levels. 2. After marking high of 70, RSI is retracing towards 50 towards mid-line standing around 50 mark. 3. Strong bullish candle formation near buying zone has given us confirmation of retracement complete and original trend begin. 4. Mid-term moving average 50 DMA placed around 945 levels defines mid-term trend is very well augur with bulls as prices are sustained and trading above it. 5. Decent volume participation while forming bullish candle will also give additional confirmation.  Profit Booking  Whenever price candle will be near previous swing high which is near Rs 1,050-1,075 levels.  Stop Loss  Entire bullish view negates on breaching of a swing low and one should exit from long position. In case of L&amp;amp;T it is standing around Rs 940 mark closing basis.  Conclusion  We recommend buying Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro around Rs 970-975 levels with a stop loss of Rs 940 on a closing basis for higher targets of Rs 1,050 and Rs 1,075 levels as indicated in above chart.

Total orderbook is now at Rs 3.03 lakh crore thereby providing strong revenue visibility going forward.  Hydrocarbon, IT and financial services segment helped the company to report 2.2 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 44,245.28 crore, while profit dropped 6.5 percent YoY to Rs 3,197 crore due to tepid revenue growth, weak operating performance and higher interest cost, though lower tax cost limited bottomline decline.  Infrastructure segment, which constituted over 73 percent of total orderbook and 58 percent to total revenue, registered a 5.7 percent fall in revenue, primarily led by slowdown due to COVID-19 environment. Operating profit declined 3 percent and margin contracted 62 basis points YoY due to weak execution.  Majority of brokerages are bullish on L&amp;amp;T given its leadership position in the infrastructure segment, strong orderbook and healthy balance sheet, though the company could face challenges due to COVID-19 in the first half of FY21. In fact they expect stock to return 14-26 percent potential upside from current levels.  &quot;We expect L&amp;amp;T to face near-term challenges on account of pandemic and working capital stress but believe them to bounce back owing to multiple levers like strong business model, diversified order book and healthy balance sheet. The company continues to focus on its strategic plan of improving their return ratios,&quot; said Prabhudas Lilladher which maintained its buy rating on the stock with a revised SOTP based target of Rs 1,192, implying 25 percent potential upside.  Going ahead, management indicated segments like heavy civil, power transmission and water to see good traction for order inflows. While management expects segments like hydrocarbon, buildings and transportation to gradually pick up by Q2/Q3FY21 and construction equipment segment to pick up by second half of FY21.  L&amp;amp;T has prudently withheld guidance on FY21 on inflows or execution, given the current operating uncertainty.  Dolat Capital also expects execution disruptions to continue in first half of FY21, mainly due to labour challenges, before it picks momentum in H2. As a result, the brokerage trimmed its FY21 and FY22 estimates.  But L&amp;amp;T is keeping an eagle eye on cash and working capital in a tough execution phase, said the brokerage, adding L&amp;amp;T remains the best play for the recovery in the capex cycle.  Dolat Capital believes L&amp;amp;T's size, diversity and balance sheet will be key competitive advantages. Current valuations are very supportive, hence the brokerage maintained buy call with a SOTP based target of Rs 1,200, implying 26 percent potential upside.  Despite a weak outlook on revenue and margins in FY21, Motilal Oswal said they did not see free cash flow for the core engineering and construction business turning negative from hereon as it expects the company to choose working capital management above revenue growth. &quot;However, there may be funding risk for non-core businesses such as L&amp;amp;T Finance Holdings or Hyderabad Metro.&quot;  L&amp;amp;T's results suggest a tough macro environment for the construction industry and likely survival challenges for debt-ridden companies, but Motilal Oswal expects L&amp;amp;T to emerge stronger in the post-COVID-19 era and further consolidate its market share in the Indian Construction industry.  On account of earnings estimates cut, the brokerage cut its price target to Rs 1,120 (prior: Rs 1,200), implying 17 percent potential upside. &quot;While the near-term outlook may look hazy, L&amp;amp;T remains the best proxy of the Indian capex story,&quot; said Motilal Oswal while maintaining buy call.  Despite the near-term headwinds, Emkay also believes that L&amp;amp;T is well-placed to emerge stronger from the slowdown as it has historically gained market share during a crisis.  Hence, the brokerage maintained buy rating on the stock with a revised target of Rs 1,103 (Rs 1,127 earlier), implying 15.5 percent potential upside.  Among brokerages, ICICI Direct is the only research firm which downgraded L&amp;amp;T to hold from buy rating, and valued L&amp;amp;T on SoTP (with base business at 16.5x FY22E EPS) with a revised target price of Rs 1,090, implying 14 percent potential upside.  &quot;L&amp;amp;T reported decent order inflows, which provides strong revenue visibility for two to three years. However, execution challenges amid COVID-19 could have some impact in the near term. Also, preservation of working capital levels would be closely monitored to maintain comfort on balance sheet front. L&amp;amp;T is expected to deliver standalone revenue CAGR of 1.2 percent and EBITDA CAGR of 9.4 percent in FY20-22,&quot; the brokerage reasoned.

This will be a window which could soon disappear,&quot; Raman told reporters after announcing the company's quarterly performance.  He said that multilaterals have a lot of developmental budgets available for spending and we are seeing a lot of Japanese credit coming in and few others also investing.  &quot;The FDI numbers have gone up. There are people who want to take call on India. What the government has to do is to create an environment which will make them feel comfortable for lending as well as investing. I think government can address some of these issues and industry can respond by moving forward,&quot; Raman added.  He further noted that the economic agenda is coming to the front burner from the back burner for the first time in the current year.  &quot;There have been a lot of political distractions. There have also been extensive industry consultations at various levels in the government and there is seriousness to revival. What is ailing us is soft consumption as there are no jobs that are getting created which has led to discretionary spends to be put on hold. If growth has to come back, if investment has to happen, it's important that consumption has to happen,&quot; Raman added.  He also noted that it will take a year and year-and-half from now for things to fall in place and the situation to improve.  Company's managing director and CEO SN Subrahmanyan said that government should speed up the pace big ticket size projects and ensure they are not stuck.  &quot;There are big ticket size projects announced like the river interlinking, road expansions, the high speed corridor, among others which are moving slowly. We do expect these to pick up as this situation cannot prevail long. There are various disputes and arbitrations which are now getting sorted out,&quot; he said.  Subrahmanyan also said that stretched balance sheets among their competitors sometimes has placed the company in the position of being the sole bidder for major infrastructure projects.  &quot;There are orders where L&amp;amp;T is the single bidder and hence, we have to bid in 2-3 rounds to win projects. In certain government projects, L&amp;amp;T's pricing is below the government's budget. In such cases, the government has cut the scope of the projects to meet their budget constraints,&quot; he added.  On expectations from the upcoming Union Budget, Raman said the government does not have enough resources to meet its plans for public spending.  &quot;The government is not scaling down its plan but is struggling to figure out a way to meet the plans. So lead indicators from the budget may be some slippages in fiscal in the larger interest of economic growth, the financial responsibility mandate that they cast upon themselves can get more flexible in implementation. The other will be how much money they will borrow,&quot; Raman added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/global-trade-barriers-creating-opportunities-for-india-lt-4846841.html

lt,2020-01-14T14:09:56+05:30,Moneycontrol News,5 reasons why Nomura downgraded Indian equities to ‘neutral’,"Top stocks from Nomura include ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Larsen &amp; Toubro and Dr. Reddy's Lab.","  Indian markets picked up momentum in the second half of 2019 to close the year with double-digit gains but macro concerns, as well as delay in earnings, could cap the upside, Nomura India said in a recent report, as it turned cautious on the Indian equities.  The brokerage downgraded the domestic equities to “neutral” from “overweight”, saying scope for outperformance was limited.  “We downgrade our tactical relative stance on Indian equities to neutral. We would look to turn more constructive on India once the domestic economy recovers much more strongly than currently expected, and/or we turn incrementally more cautious on the rest of Asia, particularly North Asia,” the report said.  The global brokerage house had upgraded India to “overweight” in August 2019. With its back against the wall given the growth headwinds, the government had finally decided to go on an offensive to arrest the decline in GDP growth rates by embarking on a series of reforms and growth-boosting measures, it had said.  At the same time, Nomura felt that a deteriorating external environment (largely due to rising US-China trade tensions) could benefit a large-liquid economy/market like India.  Since then, Indian equities have rallied, mostly due to domestic factors rather than external, and for a while, India even outperformed regional indices, as Nomura expected.  “However, as we stand currently, we find our overweight on India did not work as expected, given that North Asian markets have rallied much harder, due to a better external environment on easing US-China trade tensions,” the report said.  The cautious stance, Nomura said, was only for the short term and it remained constructive on Indian equities for the long term.  “India is home to a number of well-run, high-quality-growth businesses, which justifies its premium valuations. India should also do well if global growth slows down, given its domestic-oriented economy (not necessarily the equity index) and less-than-average exposure to electronics as well as the trade cycle,” the report said.  If US-China trade tensions were to re-emerge and India’s domestic growth recovered, India as a market could do well and outperform, it said.  Namura’s top stocks from Indian markets include ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro and Dr. Reddy's Lab.  Nomura highlighted these 5 factors for the downgrade:  Global equities more attractive   Nomura believes with the external backdrop is expected to improve marginally and the tech cycle is expected to recover. A domestic-oriented market like India may have a hard time outperforming the more cyclical North Asia markets geared to the tech/growth cycle as well as global growth.  Expectations of slow and prolonged economic recovery  India’s medium-term growth potential remains intact as Nomura continues to believe that the measures adopted, so far, by the government are positive, but more such steps may be needed to boost growth.  The Budget will be carefully watched and the general consensus is that some more “soothing measures” are likely. It is unclear how far these measures will lift the economy and may just boost sentiment on the margin.  The Nomura India Economics team expects GDP growth to average 4.7% in FY20 (year-ending March 2020) and 5.7% in FY21 and are below consensus.  Benchmark Index valuations not inexpensive  Nomura says India benchmark index valuations could remain high (if not expanded further) for reasons such as global/passive flows, channelising of domestic liquidity to stock markets due to fewer investment opportunities elsewhere (e.g. weak property market, and lower domestic deposit rates), and importantly index changes (for example recent MSCI changes added a number of high valuation-high growth stocks which gave, in our view, a one-time boost to index valuations).  Therefore, Nomura does not expect massive mean reversion; however, the brokerage house believes that given the uncertainty on the domestic growth outlook, further multiple expansion is likely capped.  High expectations  With foreign flows relatively strong, expectations are quite high for India to post a recovery soon but Nomura fears that investor patience may be running out.  The investment bank also notes that the Indian equity market (MSCI India or Sensex) is driven by a narrow set of stocks, construed as quality-growth, which has given an uncertain growth outlook.  Nomura is of the view that investors are more than happy to stick to stocks with better earnings visibility.  Rising inflation implies less room for monetary policy  As a house, Nomura expects that policy will continue to take a breather for now, given the rising inflationary pressures. However, it expects the next rate cut in Q2.  There is a risk of fiscal slip  Nomura says the fiscal policy is quite constrained too. The government appears to be using money to fund tax cuts by utilising proceeds from telecom companies (who themselves are funding by raising consumer tariffs, which could inhibit fragile consumption recovery). There is also a risk on fiscal should oil prices remain high.

lt,2020-01-13T12:38:40+05:30,Kshitij Anand,"'Nifty may touch 12,500 before Budget 2020; L&amp;T, Kotak Mahindra &amp; Titan top picks'","Markets have discounted tensions and benchmark indices hit all the highs, we expect the market to rally ahead of Budget 2020.","In the short term, the market has discounted geopolitical tensions and benchmark indices have hit all-time highs; we expect the market to rally ahead of Budget 2020, Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research - Investment Advisor, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.  Edited excerpts:  Can we say the worst is over of Indian market and all eyes are now on the Budget and earnings?   The market remained volatile amid geopolitical tension between Iran and the US, but things have not stabilised just yet. In the short-term, the market has discounted geopolitical tensions and benchmark indices have hit all-time highs; we expect the market to rally ahead of Budget 2020. Also, third-quarter results, kick-started on Friday after IT major Infosys declared its result, should play a factor  What are the important support and resistance levels to watch out for in the coming week?  The Nifty needs to hold on to 12,300 level for the upside to continue. This will act as a make or break level. 12,100 level will act as major support and any dip will be a buying opportunity.  Metal and NBFC stocks may outperform indices. The Nifty50 is likely to touch 12,500 ahead of Budget 2020, as strong currency and lower crude prices may help the Indian market to move to this short-term milestone of 12,500.  Any crucial events which investors should take note that can impact D-Street sentiment?  Q3 financial results will be a key driver. Key economic indicator data which include IIP, CPI will also impact the January series.  Global markets are also trading with positive momentum and are likely to perform well. Union Budget 2020 will also drive the market.  What is your view on Infosys results? What do you recommend – buy, sell or hold?  The focus of investors will be more aligned towards the outcome of the investigation on the whistle-blower case, attrition levels, total contract value pipeline momentum, revenue conversion of past deals and improvement in margins.  The attrition rate at Infosys stood at 21.7 percent in the second quarter of FY19 which is much higher than its closest competitor Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) that reported an attrition rate of 11.6 percent in the second quarter of FY 19.  So, actions taken and their effects will be watched closely because client satisfaction and employee attrition are closely related.  The digital business of Infosys accounts for 38.3 percent of the total revenue during the second quarter ended September, but in December quarter we are expecting there will be margin pressure due to pricing pressure.  But, banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) segments may become a driver in its revenue going forward. Based on this, we can buy Infosys amid good quarterly results in the December quarter.  Any top three stocks which you think are good breakout buys as we saw a sharp recovery in the week gone by?   Here is a list of top three stocks fundamentally strong stocks for buy on dips:  L&amp;amp;T: Buy | Target: Rs 1,450 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,250  We are expecting that budget mechanisms will bring optimism in infrastructure stocks. The centre’s push towards infrastructure — road construction, electrification of railways and high-speed rail, airport expansion, and smart cities — will set the path of growth for infra major L&amp;amp;T’s order flow.  Good revenue visibility along with the company’s diversified business and strong financials also support buying the stock. The company has also added several private players, alongside a few overseas ones, to its client base.  We recommend buying L&amp;amp;T at Rs 1,325 and keep a stop loss at Rs 1,250 on closing basis with a target of Rs 1,450.  Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy| Target: Rs 1765| Stop Loss: Rs 1635   Kotak’s loan book has grown at a CAGR of 27 percent over FY09 – FY19. Consolidated earnings growth CAGR during the same period (FY09-19) was at 27 percent.  The prudence of its risk management is visible in its lower NPA, which means its net NPA ratio has been at 0.87 percent during FY09-FY19 (one of the lowest in the industry).  Over the last five years, while other banks have struggled with asset quality issues in their corporate loan book, Kotak’s corporate loan book has grown at more than 20 percent CAGR in a challenging environment.  We recommend buying Kotak Bank at Rs 1685 and keep a stop loss at Rs 1,635 on closing basis with a target of Rs 1765.  Titan Company Ltd: Buy | Target: Rs 1,255 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,130   One of the major organized players in the jewellery sector may take part in growth by demand-driven factors. Jewellery division is witnessing muted sales due to weak demand in line with the industry.  Sales were good during the Akshaya Tritiya period. To get back on its growth track, Tanishq launched “Lavanyam” (a range of traditional South Indian jewellery) during the quarter and the watches segment is in growth momentum.  We recommend buying Titan Company at Rs 1,171 and keep a stop loss at Rs 1,130 on closing basis with a target of Rs 1,255.  Q) Why have small &amp;amp; midcaps stocks started performing recently -- is it the FII flows, or pre-budget euphoria catching up?   A) The Nifty50 is getting significantly diverged from our slow-growth economy. From Nifty50, we can see nearly 30 companies (nearly 60% of Nifty stocks) – are from balance sheets heavy sectors like power, construction, metals, telecom, real estate and oil &amp;amp; gas whose 10-year return is less than 10%.  As these heavy sectors are not performing well to give attractive returns to investors, the smart money is trying to flow to smart midcap and smallcap stocks because less room is left for investors in largecap stocks.

She further said the task force of the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) after holding 70 stakeholders' consultations on infrastructure investment in four months, recommended  investments of Rs 102 lakh crore.  The government will be adding Rs 3 lakh crore to Rs 102 lakh crore in two-three days, taking the total investment to Rs 105 lakh crore to boost the infrastructure sector, she said.  Sitharaman also said that infrastructure projects are spread across 18 states and union territories.  The share of private sectors in infrastructure projects pipeline will be at 22 percent while that of Central and State governments will have 39 percent share each in National Infra Pipeline, she said.  &quot;Projects worth Rs 42.7 lakh crore are under implementation, with 63 percent of the total infrastructure project pipeline has already been firmed up,&quot; Sitharaman said, adding that power, rail, renewables, urban, irrigation, mobility, water, heath and digital formed the bulk of the crore projects.  She said the private share in national infra pipeline at 22 percent would increase to 30 pecent by 2025.  &quot;We are looking at various steps to reform PPP projects and dispute resolution. We are also looking at various steps towards the enforcement of contracts,&quot; she said, adding a robust monitoring framework will be established.  Experts feel this is definitely a positive move for not only infrastructure, but also construction and cement stocks.  &quot;The big infra push by the government was expected since the Task Force had submitted its recommendations. What was awaited was the details of the funding and the initiatives to fix the issues in the PPP model and dispute resolution. The proposed infra spend spread across 18 states and union territories can be expected to give a fillip to revival of growth,&quot; V K Vijaykumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.  He said from the market perspective, this was certainly a sentiment positive. Capital goods and infrastructure stocks will respond positively, he feels.  Renu Baid of IIFL Institutional Equities also said it was definitely a positive move from government as there were concerns about capex on infrastructure and investment from government.  &quot;There could be near term hiccups about the timing, but from medium-to-long term, it is very strong move. In fact, this was requirement of the day from the government to give a push to the infrastructure sector,&quot; she added.  She said the move is positive for infrastructure companies like L&amp;amp;T, E&amp;amp;P firms etc, though there are still some challenges for next two quarters. &quot;We need to see how the government will provide better environment for private companies and drive demand going forward.&quot;  &quot;If we look at construction and infrastructure related companies, this step was on expected lines. We have to wait and watch the implementation,&quot; Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Group Chairman of Inditrade Capital told CNBC-TV18.  &quot;Private sector participation has been pegged at 22 percent initially, which is supposed to go up to 30 percent by 2025. That will be the critical component as we have to wait and watch what kind of private sector participation comes in in terms of investment in infrastructure projects, considering the state of private sector and availability of credit to large corporates,&quot; he said.  Bandyopadhyay said that L&amp;amp;T, and other large road construction names Dilip Buildcon, Sadbhav Infrastructure etc will be on his radar.  He also said that cement, which have not done well in the last six months, have not been his favourite, but he would continue to remain bullish, and all this infrastructure spend would definitely percolate back to good performance in cement companies.  &quot;Companies having capacities in the north and the centre would be attractive, considering the supply-demand status there. The possibility of having an upper hand as far as pricing is concerned, JK Cement, HeidelbergCement will definitely on my radar,&quot; he added.  Several infrastructure stocks reacted to the news, which came in late trade on December 31. IRB Infrastructure, KNR Constructions, Dilip Buildcon, Ashoka Buildcon, PNC Infratech etc gained up to 7 percent.

Or should we wait before putting fresh money into markets? Well, these questions are running in your mind, rest assured, you are not alone.  Investors are caught between FOMO which is fear of missing out the rally and fear as the market could witness profit taking at higher levels which could take the index lower.  The S&amp;amp;P BSE Sensex hit a fresh record high of 40,483 on Monday while the Nifty50 is still about 200 points away from hitting its record high above 12,103.  Well, the good news is that the rally is here to stay and experts see the momentum continue and take Nifty50 towards 12,700-13,000 in the next 12 months. Hence, we are in a good buy on dips market.    “We have a one-year forward target of 12,700 for Nifty 50 post-Q1 result, which we are maintaining. The outlook for the equity market has improved post the cut in corporate tax and interest rate, as well as, the reduction in the cost of raw material. All these factors have contributed to better than expected Q2 results,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.  “Earnings from H2FY20 is likely to better on account of good monsoon and stimulus from the government. A further interest rate cut from the RBI &amp;amp; Fed may improve the liquidity in the medium-term,” he said.  The latest corporate tax cuts are a structural move, and it would improve the corporate earnings estimates by around 7-10 percent thus giving a northwards inflection, which would further continue backed by investments and subsequently consumption-driven demand, suggest experts.  “Over the long term, say 3-5 years, markets are poised for a move northwards backed by solid domestic corporate earnings growth supported by domestic consumption-led demand,” Pankaj Bobade, Head of Fundamental Research at Axis Securities told Moneycontrol.  “The earnings performance of corporates over the last couple of quarters has been picking up though not in a secular manner; the texture, quality of earnings is improving. The impact of corporate tax cuts could be seen from H2FY20 onwards; the impact of any other reforms would be seen 6 months down the line,” he said.

Over the medium term, the company retains the target of 8-10 percent volume growth and healthy market share gains in the India business.  The company aims to build Healthy Foods, Premium Hair Nourishment and Male Grooming into growth engines of the future and expects to deliver value growth at 20 percent plus CAGR over the medium term in these portfolios.  On the international front, the company expects to clock organic broad-based double-digit constant currency growth over the medium term.  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro  The company looks forward to a period of increased investment momentum and continued growth. Initiatives towards improved productivity, cost efficiencies derived from leveraging digital technology, capacity utilisation, and capability enhancement are expected to help the company maximise its shareholder returns (RoE) on a sustainable basis.  Consolidated order book of the group stood at Rs 29,4014 crore as of June 30, 2019, with international order book constituting 21 percent of the total. The company successfully won new orders worth Rs 38,700 crore at the group level during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, registering a growth of 11 percent.  International orders during the year at Rs 9,005 crore constituted 23 percent of the total order inflow. Order wins in Infrastructure and Power segments were the major contributors to the order inflow during the quarter.  UltraTech Cement  The Government's firm commitment to revive the economy and the thrust on infrastructure spending augurs well for the growth of cement demand. The company with its presence across all the zones in the country is the best positioned to take advantage of the revival in cement demand.  As seen in the earlier acquisitions, the management’s ability to turn around the acquired assets provides confidence in the company and the management expects similar performance even in the newly acquired Century assets. UltraTech completed the acquisition of Century's cement business recently.  ITC  Despite an extremely challenging operating environment, the company has consolidated its leadership position in the industry and continued to improve its standing in key competitive markets across the country.  This demonstrates the resilience of the company's portfolio of brands, superior consumer insights and its relentless focus on value creation.  According to the management of the company, the company is focusing on growth of its FMCG business by entering newer segments and tapping the opportunity in the foods segment. This would be a catalyst for topline growth in the long run.  ICICI Bank  The bank is focusing on growing the core operating profit in a risk calibrated manner instead of loan growth. The bank aims to improve the share of profitable market opportunities by making delivery to the customers more seamless and frictionless through digitisation and process improvements.  Business performance of the bank such as domestic loan growth, overall corporate advances, retail loan growth, CASA ratio is continuously improving. The business of the bank increased at an accelerated pace of 18 percent YoY to Rs 12,53,147 crore at the end of June 2019, supported by loan growth improving by 15 percent at Rs 5,92,415 crore.  Meanwhile, the deposits growth galloped to 21 percent at Rs 6,60,732 crore at the end of June 2019. The bank had indicated that credit cost in FY2020 is expected to reduce significantly compared to FY2019.  Expert: Pankaj Bobade, Head of Fundamental Research at Axis Securities  Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB)  The net interest margins (NIMs) of KMB are amongst the best in the industry and have been in the range of 4-4.6 percent over the last 3 years. The management expects better pricing power in certain high yielding segments which will help in sustaining NIMs.  KMB has maintained benign asset quality with limited exposure to stressed sectors and conservative lending practices. Further improvement in asset quality since FY18 was seen with G/NNPAs at 2.2/0.7 percent in Q1FY20 (Slippages 1.45 percent ann). Provisioning Coverage Ratio stood at 67 percent which provides comfort.  KMB is well positioned due to higher capitalisation (Tier I - 17.3 percent), a strong liability franchise (CASA: 51 percent) and benign asset quality, which would allow it to gain further market share.  RITES  RITES has a strong and diversified order book. RITES’ standalone order book stands at Rs 6,052 crore (3x FY19 revenue). The order book is expected to grow by over 17 percent in FY20 which provides strong revenue visibility for the next 2-3 years.  The Order book is well diversified with high margin consultancy and low margin turnkey business contributing 41 percent each. RITES has a competitive edge in winning orders owing to its over four decades of experience in transport infrastructure consultancy and its association with MoR.  Ample opportunities within railways (50 percent revenue share) being captured by RITES via venturing into turnkey projects and railway station development is increasing its scale of operations. Focus on strengthening EPC business, diversification and continuous infrastructure push by the government is expected to augur well for RITES.  Dixon Technologies  Dixon is a leading player in Flat Panel Display (FPD) TV with over 50 percent market share. It is also a leading player in Lighting accounting for over 35 percent domestic volumes and commands over 40 percent share in the Washing Machines EMS market.  Indian Consumer Electronics and Appliances market is expected to grow at a faster pace of 19 percent CAGR between FY19-21E as compared to global CEA market growth at 8 percent CAGR in the same period. High growth in consumer electronics and increasing EMS presents a huge opportunity for players like Dixon.  We expect strong growth in key segments viz., Consumer Electronics, Lighting and Home Appliances led by a strong order book. The addition of new clients, recovery in the mobile segment and robust growth in the security surveillance segment would aid revenue growth, going forward.  Amber Enterprises  Amber is the market leader in the OEM/ODM industry with 55.4 percent share in volume terms (outsourced market). AEL’s share stands at 19.1 percent in the overall residential air-conditioning (RAC) market in terms of volume.  Key customers include Godrej, Bluestar, Daikin, Hitachi, LG, Panasonic, Voltas, Whirlpool and Carrier Midea, which together account for 75 percent of the market share.  With the acquisition of Sidwal Refrigeration, the company has made a foray in the mobile air-conditioning segment. We believe that Sidwal Refrigeration Industries Pvt Ltd (SRIPL) is a strategic fit in Amber’s portfolio.  Amber will continue to deliver industry-leading growth and is a proxy play in evolving and fast-growing RAC market- the most underpenetrated segment in the white goods category in India.  Expert: Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services  Avanti Feeds  A leading exporter of processed prawn and fish feeds in India. Avanti has five shrimp feed manufacturing units with a capacity of 6,00,000 MT and two processing and exporting units with a capacity of 22,000 MT.  Being the market leader in the feed segment the company is aiming to become one of the largest players in the processing segment through its capacity addition.  The recent improvement witnessed in farm-gate and stabilisation in export prices provides a better outlook for both Feed and Processing segments. Going forward the revenue/PAT is expected to grow at 14/19 percent CAGR over FY19-21E.  Coromandel International  Largest privately-owned phosphatic fertilizer manufacturers in India with a considerable presence in its home market, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and other nearby states.  The subsequent improvement in monsoon and central government schemes like the Pradhan Mantri-Kisan scheme announced this year to help double farmer income and boost the demand for fertilizer products.  Expect PAT to grow by a CAGR of 17 percent during FY19-21E on the back of an increase in the share of new unique grade products and improvement in margins due to backward integration.  Mold-Tek Packaging:  It is one of the leading manufacturers and suppliers of high quality airtight and pilfers proof containers/pails in India for Paints, Lubricants, Food and FMCG.  The company is credited with shifting Indian paint and lubricant industry to plastic pails from metal containers. Going forward, MTEP is expected to capitalise on long-term growth opportunities, aided by higher volumes due to increasing acceptance of IML in paint and lubricant segments.  Further, focus on capacity expansion, diversification of end-users and penetration into newer markets will drive earnings growth.  Brokerage: HSBC  L&amp;amp;T Finance Holding  The brokerage has a buy rating on L&amp;amp;T Finance Holding with a target price of Rs 130.  LTFH delivered a stable September quarter performance in a very challenging environment.  Focused loan book grew 19 percent on a YoY basis, while asset quality and margins (plus fees) remained largely stable on QoQ. It raise FY20-22e earnings on lower tax outgo.  The management has maintained a fine balance between growth and asset quality. Risks associated with asset quality outlook of the wholesale mortgage loans appear priced in.

lt,2019-10-28T08:15:23+05:30,Kshitij Anand,Record high in Samvat 2076: Top 10 high-quality stocks for your portfolio  ,"Mid and small-cap stocks have remained under pressure in Samvat 2075. But, there could be stock-specific opportunities that could come in the next 12 months","Indian market remained volatile, but rose a little over 9 percent in Samvat 2075. However, the rally may not be over yet.  Experts feel that we are well on track to hit fresh record highs by Diwali 2020 as most of the bad news is priced in.  There are many global and domestic headwinds which the D-Street has to fight it out in the short term for it to break out into unchartered territory. But, the recent fall in the Indian market has made valuations slightly more attractive.  Most experts see Nifty50 hovering in the range of 12,300-13,500 levels in the next one year. The opportunities are likely to remain stock specific; hence, investors should do bottom-up cherry-picking from different sectors.  “The earnings yield of equities is attractive and supportive of high valuations. A bearish outlook on oil and commodities in general also upholds India’s case. The fag-end monsoon onslaught, which fetched an excess to the tune of 110 percent of long-term averages, augurs well for the next Rabi crop,” YES Securities said in a note.  “Our one-year target for Nifty is placed at 12,330, based on 21x multiple to FY21 earnings. Our best-case target stands at 12,915 but with high chances of a steep fall, which may even pull back Nifty to sub-11,000,” it said.  The market is putting a good fight amid bad news from both global, as well as, domestic fronts but most of it is in the prices, feels Atul Suri, Founder &amp;amp; CEO, Marathon Trends in an exclusive interview with CNBC-Tv18. He feel that Nifty may touch 13,500 by Samvat 2076.  Key monitorable to watch out in the next 12 months include the global situation, math of fiscal deficit, Indian Rupee movement (specifically pursuant to any US-China trade war escalation) and ongoing stress in real estate, SMEs and shadow banks.  Although mid and small-cap stocks have remained under pressure in Samvat 2075 but there could be stock-specific opportunities that could come in the next 12 months.  In the next three years, there could be 12-15 percent compounded gains in the market, said market veteran Madhu Kela in a chat with CNBC TV18. Kela said that he prefers midcaps than indices at this juncture as it is more about the quality and cheaper stocks than sectors.  We have collated a list of 10 high-quality stocks from different brokerage firms which investors could look at buying for Samvat 2076:  Brokerage Firm: Yes Securities  HDFC Bank: Buy  Within the Indian financial system, the macro scenario has been playing out in a way that would immensely benefit larger well-governed and well-capitalized private banks having solid outreach and brand equity.  The choking of NBFCs, weaker position and consolidation within PSU Banks and specific issues faced by smaller/regional private banks and co-operative banks would mean a significant shift of incremental business to stronger private banks.  The one bank which we trust to take ‘prudent advantage’ of the given opportunity is HDFC Bank. The bank is set to witness accelerated market share gains, reflected in its resilient loan growth delivery amid a slowing system-wide credit growth.  ICICI Bank: Buy  Over the past four years, ICICI Bank has impressively de-risked and rebalanced its core revenue streams by increasing the contribution of retail loans (61 percent of loans), de-emphasizing on international lending (10 percent), focusing on higher-rated domestic corporate loans, reducing exposure to stressed sectors/borrower groups, substantially increasing the share of low-cost sticky deposits and retailizing the fee income to a large extent.  Along with margins and credit cost, subtle improvement in cost metric through digitization would also be an RoA driver. Stand-alone bank’s RoE would likely reach 15 percent in FY21.  Adjusted for the significant value of its holdings in ICICI Pru Life, ICICI Lombard, ICICI Pru AMC, and I-Sec, the ICICI Bank trades at a valuation of 1.7x FY21 P/ABV. Its capital position is robust with Tier-1 ratio at 15.6 percent.  UltraTech Cement: Buy  Post-acquisition of Century cement assets, the domestic capacity of UltraTech Cements has scaled to ~113.4 MTPA, translating into a volume share of 25 percent vis-à-vis 10 percent in FY05.  Although the demand remains jittery in the near term due to liquidity crunch and slowdown in Govt funding towards infrastructure, we believe the sluggish scenario is transient in nature.  We reckon that massive investments lined up in the infrastructure segment combined with a pick-up in tier 2 and tier 3 housing space will drive growth going ahead.  UltraTech Cement will continue to outperform the industry growth rate on the back of ramp-up of organic capacity and sweating of inorganic assets.  Polycab India: Buy  Polycab is a market leader (12 percent organized market share) in the domestic C&amp;amp;W segment led by its diverse product portfolio, strong distribution network, and high brand recall.  Domestic C&amp;amp;W market is expected to witness 10-12 percent CAGR over FY19-22E on the back of strong power distribution capex, strengthening of current T&amp;amp;D network revival in demand from real estate and adoption of electric vehicles.  In line with its aim to evolve as a large B2C player, the company is constantly investing in new products and new categories in the FMEG space.  Led by strong revenue CAGR of 25 percent over FY19-22E in the FMEG space and execution of large orders over the next two years in the C&amp;amp;W segment, we expect the company to witness a revenue/operating profit of 10.8 percent/9.9 percent CAGR over FY19-22E.  Cochin Shipyard Ltd: Buy  Cochin Shipyard (CSL) has an order book of Rs80.5bn &amp;amp; it is also likely to receive incremental order for IAC Phase III (~Rs103bn) soon. This implies a total order backlog of Rs183.5 (~6x TTM sales) by FY20.  Shipbuilding (SB) is expected to deliver a healthy 21 percent CAGR over FY19-21E. CSL also has a shipbuilding order pipeline of Rs100bn+ comprising next-gen missile vessels, solar research vessels &amp;amp; coastal shipping vessels which are likely to be finalized over FY19-21.  Strong infrastructure capabilities coupled with diverse competencies in the SB &amp;amp; SR segments give CSL a significant edge over peers. With a huge capex planned at Rs30bn over FY18-21E (funded through internal accrual) and superior return profile (average RoEs, RoCEs of 15.5 percent, 16.5 percent, respectively, in FY12-17), we believe CSL is a quality play and is on a strong footing.  Brokerage Firm: Motilal Oswal  State Bank of India: Buy  Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal is of the view that State Bank of India (SBI) is well poised for an earnings recovery led by a steady operating performance at the PPOP level, recoveries from NCLT resolutions and normalization in credit cost to 1.9 percent/1.3 percent over FY20E/FY21E.  Hindustan Unilever: Buy  Four key trends point towards an elevated earnings growth trajectory for HUL compared to the past, such as (1) rapidly improving adaptability to market requirements, (2) recognition and strong execution on Naturals, (3) continuous strong trend towards premiumization, and (4) extensive plans to employ technology, creating further entry barriers. Premium valuations are justified as the company has the best earnings growth visibility in the large-cap Indian consumer space, and also, the highest return ratios so far.  Titan Company: Buy  The longer-term investment case remains strong as Titan is well placed to grow led by a combination of its own initiatives and regulatory tailwinds.  With over 60 percent of the jewelry segment growth continuing to come from SSSG, operating margins are also likely to improve.  Ashok Leyland (AL): Buy  Unlike the previous cycles, AL is currently on a strong footing (lean cost structure and net cash balance sheet) and is focused on adding new revenue/profit pools. Valuations are reasonable in view of the downcycle in earnings.  L&amp;amp;T: Buy  For L&amp;amp;T, we forecast adjusted consolidated EPS CAGR of 23 percent over FY19-21. Consolidated RoEs should expand to 17.6 percent by FY21 from 14.6 percent in FY18.  Adjusted for valuation of subsidiaries, core E&amp;amp;C business is trading at FY20/21E P/E of 19.6x/16.1x, which is at a significant discount to its long-term one-year-forward trading multiple of 23x.

","The government should overlook political expediencies, instead prioritise its spending to meet the needs of a struggling economy, engineering major Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro said on October 23.  The government is delaying payments, leading to pressure on working capital, the management of the engineering major said, adding it cannot &quot;afford&quot; such a situation.  &quot;The government has to prioritise allocation of funds to projects and contractors and also its vendors. It is very important that the government spend is not confined to political ends, but diverted towards economic ends,&quot; chief financial officer R Shankar Raman told reporters while announcing the second quarter numbers.  He was replying to a specific question on what can be done to revive the tottering growth.  Raman also pointed out that even though the systemic liquidity is in surplus of over Rs 2 lakh crore, bankers are not lending but clinging on to cash.  &quot;I think there has to be a rediscovery of belief in the credit system. Ships are safest in the harbours, but they are not meant to stay in the harbours.  &quot;Non-performing assets are part and parcel of any credit delivery system and that cannot be allowed to paralyse the flow of money,&quot; he said.  The government should also get the stalled projects started which alone can create over 1 lakh jobs, he said.  Chief executive SN Subrahmanyan said, &quot;the government must allocate funds for the right reasons&quot; as government orders account for almost 70 percent of business for companies like him get as private sector is not investing.  &quot;Given that the government is free of elections now it should get into governance and push projects,&quot; he said.  Raman said the Centre, the states and also state-run enterprises are delaying payments, leading to pressures on working capital for them, and that the usual tendency of getting payments in the second quarter has not been observed this year.  &quot;Unfortunately, our results and our financial health being such, there is a presumption in the system that we can afford (it) and that is something we need to fight...we can't afford it,&quot; he asserted, speaking of a need in perceptions.  Raman said despite all these, L&amp;amp;T has been honouring payments to all the vendors,roiling its financial performance.  Subrahmanyan pointed out that the government has gone slow on roads projects and the company, which has invested heavily in the sector, needs orders of over Rs 15,000 crore in second half from NHAI to meaningfully sustain its investment.  He also said the ambitious bullet train project is also not going as planned and sought a &quot;push&quot; from the government for the same.  As most of the work on the dedicated freight corridors is over, revenue booking from this stream will be hit soon, he said, adding more such mega projects are essential for the economy and companies like his.  He also rued that the river interlinking scheme has not &quot;moved at all&quot;, which will give opportunities to companies like L&amp;amp;T on the waterfront, along with desalination works.  As the residential and commercial realty projects are down, L&amp;amp;T has to depend on institutional projects like state-run hospitals and management training institutes for bagging constriction projects, he said.  Raman said as the slowdown is very &quot;visible&quot;, the company has managed to sail through by focusing on foreign projects in the second quarter.  He also said opportunities in defence, where the government has promised large business for the private sector, are &quot;hard to come by&quot;.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/overlook-political-expedienciesprioritise-spends-lt-to-govt-4568151.html

Nomura maintained its buy call on L&amp;amp;T but slashed its target price to Rs 1,725 from Rs 1,745 earlier.  Growth guidance has been retained as prospects remain robust, which is a good sign.

The government has rolled out the roadmap for the next five years in order to promote growth, increase investment in key sectors like power and infrastructure. ","Considering the on-going challenges that the government is facing to maintain a balance between promoting growth and at the same time ensuring fiscal discipline, we would consider this as a decent budget focused on long term growth and thus assign a 3 rating, Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking Ltd, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.  Edited excerpts:  Q: Which were the major winners and losers from Budget 2019?  A) The Budget was largely in-line with street expectations. The government has announced steps to promote the growth of the rural economy and boost agri income.  We feel this could be positive for agri stocks like PI Industries, Rallis India, GNFC, Godrej Agrovet. Further, consumer stocks like Dabur India, HUL, Colgate Palmolive India and Britannia Industries that have been witnessing volume pressure in rural areas will stand to be the key beneficiaries of these announcements.  Additionally, the government’s move to allocate Rs 70,000 crore for recapitalisation of public sector banks is encouraging, as it would mean more capital for PSU banks and comply with RBI capital requirement guidelines.  The step is positive for banks like SBI, BOB and Bank of India. Also, the government has proposed to move regulation of HFCs from National Housing Board to RBI, which would be positive for housing finance companies like HDFC, LIC housing finance, GIC housing, etc. as it would improve stability in the sector in the long term.  However, certain moves like an increase in customs duty on gold and precious metals from 10 percent to 12.5 percent were against market expectations of a reduction in the duty. This could negatively impact gold and jewellery companies like Titan, TBZ, Shirpur Gold and Rajesh Exports.  Further, custom duty on indoor and outdoor split ACs was hiked to 20 percent from the current 10 percent. This could negatively impact stocks like Voltas, Blue Star, IFB Industries and Whirlpool.  Q: How do you rate the Budget 2019 on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the best and 1 being the worst)?  A: We feel the budget has largely focused on creating a roadmap for the next five years to promote growth and investments in the Indian economy. These measures are expected to yield results over a longer period.  We feel, given the current slowdown in the Indian economy, the market was expecting few more and immediate growth measures/steps than what has been announced.  However, considering the on-going challenges that the government is facing to maintain a balance between promoting growth and at the same time ensuring fiscal discipline, we would consider this as a decent budget focused on long term growth and thus mark 3 out 5.  Q: Anything specific that could impact investors and markets.  A: The Budget had both its hits and misses. The government rolled out the roadmap for the next five years in order to promote growth, increase investment in key sectors like power and infrastructure.  However, the growth stimulus was lower than market expectations which could have a sentimental impact on the markets in the near term given the slowdown in the economy.  On the positive side, the government lowering its fiscal deficit target (3.3 percent in FY20 from 3.4 percent) would instil confidence amongst market participants.  Q: Top five stocks that investors can look at buying post the Budget.  A: Based on the announcements in the budget, we feel one can consider investing in companies like Dabur, Britannia, Godrej Agrovet, Rallis India, SBI, HDFC, and L&amp;amp;T. These stocks hold promising prospects and would stand to be key beneficiaries.

The overall sentiments turned positive on optimism ahead of Budget 2019 which is scheduled to be presented later this week.  From the derivative front, Put writers were active in 11,800 and 11,850 strikes in weekly contracts that should act as support for the Nifty with (weekly) expiry point of view.  However, on the higher side, immediate resistance is placed at 11,980-12,000. The technical structure on the daily interval also suggests the upside momentum is likely to continue in the coming sessions.  Last week also we have observed technical breakout above the falling trend line on a shorter time frame that suggests bears are likely to remain on the back foot as of now and Nifty should move towards 12,000 in coming sessions.  Here are three stocks that could return 7-12 percent in the next 3-4 weeks:  IPCA Laboratories: Buy| Target: Rs 1,057| Stop loss: Rs 900| Upside: 10 percent  For more than six weeks, the stock has been consolidating in a range of Rs 900-950 and is hovering above its long-term moving averages along with consistent buying at support levels.  This week, we have observed fresh consolidation breakout into the prices along with marginally higher volumes that suggest upside move forward.  Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 960-965 for the upside target of Rs 1,057, with a stop loss below Rs 900.  Can Fin Homes: Buy| Target: Rs 409| Stop loss: Rs 340| Upside: 12 percent  In the recent past, after taking support at its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily charts placed around Rs 310, the stock has risen sharply above Rs 350 in a short span of time.  Since then, prices are maintaining well above its short-term moving averages and the stock is trading with the formation of higher top and higher bottom pattern.  On the weekly interval charts as well, the stock is maintaining above its long term moving averages and is on the verge of a fresh breakout above the key resistance levels of Rs 365.  A breakout above Rs 365 can add further momentum into prices moving forward. So, traders can buy the stock above the breakout level of 365 for the upside target of 409, with a stop loss below 340.  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: Buy| Target: Rs 1,670| Stop loss: Rs 1,500| Upside: 7 percent  The stock has been consistently trading in a rising channel on the daily interval and tested its 52-week high of Rs 1,607 last month.  On the technical charts, the stock has managed to take support at its 20-day exponential moving average on the daily interval.  It has also given a breakout above the symmetrical triangle pattern that can move prices towards 52-week high in the coming sessions.  Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1,560-1,565 for the upside target of Rs 1,670, with a stop loss below Rs 1,500.

lt,2019-06-01T09:59:33+05:30,Moneycontrol Contributor,'Capital goods sector is a dark horse in the next bull run',After winning the 2019 elections the Modi 2.0 government is expected to increase its focus on infrastructure spending which will aid capital goods consumption.,"Arpan Shah  Capital goods sector is a major contributor to GDP, but the capital goods index, which is considered as a GDP-linked index, has hardly contributed to the broader market in many years. No leadership has been seen in the sector and it has been a laggard in the Indian market for more than a decade.  In November 2007, the BSE Capital Goods index was around 20,500 levels and it is trading near the same levels after more than a decade. So, in these 12 years, the returns from the sector are none. If you compare it with broader index, Nifty50 has moved from 5,500 levels to 12,000 levels, thereby giving manifold returns in the same period. And even in this investment theme, a sector like banking has moved from 9,500 to 31,000 levels in the same period.  Multiple reasons for the slowdown of the sector are the rise in Chinese imports, higher interest rates, overcapacity and stuck old projects. But many steps were taken during PM Modi's first term to reduce the bottlenecks. Inflation under control is one of the biggest achievements and RBI has been reducing rates as well. Going further, RBI is likely to cut further as well.  After winning the 2019 elections, the new Modi government is expected to increase its focus on infrastructure spending which will aid capital goods consumption. It is likely to spend more than Rs 1 lakh crore on infra projects over the next 5 years, and this will be a big boost for the capital goods sector.  On the valuation front, the current valuation of capital goods stocks is very cheap and they are trading below their historical valuation averages. As the investment cycle is about to pick up, investors should be looking to hunt for an investment opportunity in this sector.  BSE Capital Goods Index: 20,430    On the technical front, the index is bouncing back from trendline support and it has broken out from the falling channel on the monthly chart. There is resistance at 21,000 level but once it takes out this level, it is heading for much more higher levels.  Once it breaks out, it will be coming out from the 12 years consolidation, it is likely to take leadership in the market for the next few quarters.  And by no means is this a short term trading idea but this sector is a long term investment opportunity. We have bullish outlook on two stocks from this sector.  L&amp;amp;T: Buy | Target: Rs 1,700-1,900  One of the top pick form the sector is the Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro. This stock has finally broken out from narrow range after months of flat consolidation. It is one of the large cap stocks which holds highest weight in this index and likely to be the biggest beneficiary of upcoming government projects. L&amp;amp;T is involved in different infra projects like road projects (Bhartmala, Sagarmala), Bullet and Metro train project as well as Defence projects.  Looking at the current price momentum we can safely say that it can lead the rally of next bull run. It is a buying opportunity at current Rs 1,550 level with upside target of Rs 1,700 and Rs 1,900. Investors can add on dips till Rs 1,450 and keep the stoploss level at Rs 1,300.  Thermax: Buy | Target: Rs 1,150-1,300  The stock has been in uptrend with higher top higher bottom formation on monthly chart. It is bouncing back from trendline support with 'Doji' candle in last month and bullish candle confirmation at this month.  Thermax's major revenue income is from power sector, capital goods and with revival of the power projects, stock is likely to perform well in coming months. It is one of the midcap investment ideas from the sector with the healthy upside. Investors can accumulate between Rs 970-1,030 level with stoploss level of Rs 850 and upside target of Rs 1,150-1,300 levels.  (The author is Technical Analyst at Monarch Networth Capital.)

lt,2019-05-24T14:43:39+05:30,Kshitij Anand,"ICICI Bank, Titan Company, L&amp;T among top 5 wealth-creating ideas for next 5 years","It is a good time for investors looking to start their fresh journey in the market along with the new government at the center, Siddhartha Khemka of MOSL. ","It is a good time for investors looking to start their fresh journey in the market along with the new government at the Centre, Siddhartha Khemka, Head – Retail research, MOFSL, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.  Q: What is the range you are looking at for Nifty or Sensex based on the election results? Do you think we are heading for new highs in 2019?  A: India voted decisively in favour of the incumbent BJP-led NDA government. The market reacted positively with benchmark indices touching new highs.  The S&amp;amp;P BSE Sensex crossed 40,000 levels for the first time and touched an intraday high of 40,124 while Nifty 50 crossed 12,000-mark to touch 12,041 intraday on Thursday.  However, some profit booking was seen on the election result day as indices had seen a decent move post the Exit Polls on Monday.  We expect the momentum in the market to sustain over the next few weeks. The verdict of a continuance of stable government with majority augurs well from reforms and policy agenda perspective.  However, we do not see a room for significant re-rating for markets from current ~12,000 levels given the underlying fair valuations and continued earnings downgrades. The Nifty50 is currently trading ~19x FY20 P/E which is above the long term averages.  Q: What are the sectors which one can bet on based on the govt. which will form the government and why?  A: The massive win by NDA brings the focus back on the BJP manifesto 2019. The manifesto was good from economists’ perspective as it didn’t include any populist schemes or unrealistic promises.  The manifesto focused to continue on the key reforms started earlier like – Housing, health, and education for all Make in India, MUDRA scheme, various incentives to farmers etc.  From the infrastructure perspective, the manifesto aims to invest Rs 100 lakh crore over the next five years. Hence, we expect sectors like corporate banks, Consumer, Cement, Capital Goods, Infra and construction to do well over the next few years.  Q: As a new government takes centre stage, should investors look at select mid &amp;amp; smallcaps for the next 5 years?  A: Yes, midcaps clearly offers the scope for a valuation catch-up as there is a huge divergence in their performance. In the last year, the Nifty Midcap100 Index was down by about 7 percent while the Nifty 50 index gained about 10 percent, resulting in a sharp underperformance of 17 percent from midcaps.  There have been issues like corporate governance, earnings downgrades as well as regulatory uncertainty regarding mid and smallcaps in the past which led to their underperformance.  However, given that sentiments have changed now after the election verdict, there could be good inflows into some of the mid and small cap quality names where there is room for valuation expansion.  Hence, one has to stick to quality names and look at bottoms-up opportunities in the midcaps space.  Q:  What would be your advice to investors for the next 5 years who are probably starting their journey with this new government at the Center?  A: It is a good time for investors looking to start their fresh journey in the market along with the new government at the Center. The mandate is clearly in favour of the continuance of government which augurs well from reforms and policy agenda perspective.  The economy would also see the benefit of the development work carried out by the government in the last five years. Hence there is an expectation of stable growth in the economy which bodes well for the equity market.  Further, corporate earnings are likely to see a recovery in FY20 after four tepid years. However, given the current valuations, we would suggest new investors adopt a staggered investment strategy to benefit from any correction in the market.  Q: Top 5 fundamentally strong stocks which investors can look buying at for the next 5 years?  A: Here is a list of top 5 stocks which are good long term bets for the next 5 years:  ICICI Bank:  ICICI Bank has delivered a steady performance at the PPOP (Pre-Provision Operating profit) level and is showing signs of earnings normalization. With asset quality stabilizing, we expect credit cost to moderate meaningfully in FY20/21, boosting return ratios.  ICICI Bank has improved its provisioning coverage and guided for normalization in credit cost from FY20, which will drive its RoE or return on equity expansion. We have a Buy rating, with a near term target of Rs 470  Titan Company Ltd:   Jewellery growth prospects remain robust, and now Watches and even Eyewear have started contributing to growth. In addition, operating leverage arising from the rising share of SSSG in Jewellery sales (72% in FY19 over an already impressive 60% in FY18) is likely to drive healthy EBITDA margin expansion, fuelling the best-of-breed and sustained earnings growth performance for the company.  High valuations are fully deserved for a business that has perhaps the best top-line growth visibility in the large-cap FMCG/retail space (20% CAGR in Jewellery, the largest segment, in the next four years). We have a Buy rating on the stock.  UltraTech Cement:   The acquisition of Century’s cement asset and Binani has led to increasing capacity and market share in the North to 26 percent (from 19% currently) for UltraTech Cement which took its pan-India capacity market share to 25 percent (from 20% currently).  UltraTech Cement reported strong numbers in Q4 as well as in FY19. Healthy operating performance along with consistent efforts to lower costs arguers well for UltraTech.  This along with industry tailwinds should help UltraTech in improving profitability going forward. We have a buy rating with a Rs 5,190.  L&amp;amp;T:   The management exceeded its FY19 revenue/order inflow guidance. It is positive on ordering environment as prospective orders have got funding tied-up and will be awarded eventually.  Total prospects across the domestic and overseas market stand at Rs 9 lakh crore. With the overall strike rate at ~20 percent, it implies Rs 1.8-2 lakh crore of fresh orders.  We forecast an adjusted consolidated EPS CAGR of 25 percent over FY19-21. The core E&amp;amp;C EPS CAGR is estimated at 35 percent over the same period, helped by strong execution, normalization of margins and financial leverage. Consolidated RoEs should expand to 18 percent by FY21 from 14.6 percent in FY18.  Siemens Ltd:   The strong focus on products/services has helped Siemens to mitigate the slowdown in industrial capex, as it has been able to capitalize on opex-related spending. We expect the trend to continue, driving strong growth for its products business.  Any revival in capex spending can further strengthen its revenue trajectory. We expect overall revenue growth to be driven by Building Technologies, Mobility, Digital Factory, and Process Industries.  The current valuation provides comfort, given the scope of an improvement in the operating performance and the likely gradual recovery in capex.

Sequential performance is also expected to be robust given strong order inflow.  Profit is likely to grow in the range of 10-25 percent YoY, but sequential growth could be 30-90 percent, brokerages said, adding revenue may increase over 10 percent YoY.  For Q4FY19, Motilal Oswal expects revenue growth of 11 percent YoY to Rs 45,200 crore. &quot;We have factored in 11 percent YoY growth in the E&amp;amp;C segment driven by execution in the domestic segment,&quot; it said.  L&amp;amp;T is likely to lead Q4FY19 with strong order inflows, said ICICI Securities. Company has announced orders in excess of Rs 47,000 crore and is expected to report strong order inflows growth during the quarter.  It has secured orders worth more than Rs 16,000 crore in hydrocarbon, Rs 18,000 crore in construction, Rs 3,500 crore in power T&amp;amp;D and around Rs 9,500 crore in water &amp;amp; effluent treatment segment.  Edelweiss said it expects 14 percent YoY growth in core EPC revenues led mainly by the infra segment. Services businesses are expected to grow at 25 percent, it added.  Kotak also expects 13 percent growth in core EPC execution in Q4FY19, leading to around 17 percent growth for the full year in core EPC.  &quot;Infrastructure segment will report a modest around 8 percent revenue growth in line with opening backlog that was up 9 percent YoY. The biggest growth driver is expected to be the hydrocarbon segment, growing 28 percent YoY in the quarter continuing the robust performance from 9MFY19 (+32 percent) on the back of strong order inflows that constituted 16 percent share of core E&amp;amp;C order inflows in 9MFY19,&quot; the brokerage said.

Hence, the investors may still invest in quality stocks","At the current level, the market has priced in most of the positives but good corporate earnings could help the market inch higher. Key concerns will be the sustainability of the FII inflow at current valuations and sustained recovery in corporate earnings. Change in the political environment could pose challenges for our market, said Rajeev Srivastava, Head Retail Broking, Reliance Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar.  Edited excerpts:  Q: Nifty has rallied from 10,600 to 11,760, how do you position yourself in the market at current levels?  A: The market has rallied based on favourable opinion polls and cut in interest rate. The inflation environment has been quite benign and another round of interest cut cannot be ruled out. We believe the market will focus on corporate earnings as we enter the results season. Banking will continue to be the key focus sector with good credit growth and stable yields.  Q: According to you, what is fueling the ongoing rally?  A: This has largely been a pre-election rally with the expectation that the incumbent government will retain power. Further, conducive FII inflow mainly in the form of ETFs in pursuit of better yields with a stable rupee supported the rally.  At the current level, the market has priced in most of the positives but good corporate earnings could help the market inch higher. Our key concerns will be the sustainability of the FII inflow at current valuations and sustained recovery in corporate earnings. Change in the political environment could pose challenges for our market.  Q: What is your earnings forecast for FY20?  A: Nifty earnings are expected to increase in double-digit in the range of 15-18 percent, which is reasonable on the backdrop of low base and visible improvement asset quality ratio of BFSIs, which commands around 39 percent weight. We believe banking, infrastructure, cement and consumer should do well.  Q: Sensex surged 4,000 points in past six weeks. Is it the right time to buy stocks?  A: There has never been dearth of quality and alpha-generating stocks in the market irrespective of cycles. Hence, investors may still invest in quality stocks.  Q: What is your take on banking and financial stocks that have been front-runners in the rally?  A: The sector has outperformed in the recent past despite headwinds including sluggish capex cycle, delay in corporate recoveries and challenges in deposit growth, leaving little margin of safety given the strong upside. We prefer large banks with strong liability franchise and adequate provisioning levels.  Q: What are your top five picks for FY20?  A: Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro  L&amp;amp;T continues to remain one of the prime beneficiaries of the up-tick in capex in India. It is well-placed in the focused sectors like defence, road, railways and power T&amp;amp;D. We believe the company is well-placed to benefit from several big-ticket projects, as it satisfies all basic requirements from balance-sheet size, strong track record, technical expertise and adequate liquidity to bid for such projects.  ICICI Bank  We believe ICICI Bank’s liability and asset franchise has strengthened over the years with de-risking of its loan portfolio, rising market share in CASA, increased competitiveness in cost of funds relating to peers and improving capital efficiencies. We expect its RoEs to expand to 14 percent by FY20E and 15 percent by FY21E from 4 percent in FY19E, driven by improvement in margin and decline in credit cost.  Hindustan Unilever  HUL is expected to witness the fastest earnings growth among the major FMCG companies. It is estimated to register earnings CAGR of 23 percent over FY19-21 driven by both organic and inorganic initiatives. Acquisition of GSK Consumer’s India business provides HUL a strong foothold in the foods segment in terms of diversifying its portfolio and reducing dependence on homecare and personal care segments.  JK Cement  Healthy demand environment in its key markets including northern region and likely improvement in realisations in the northern region are expected to aid the company’s performance. Its value-added products continue to remain cash cow and ensure better return ratios. We expect its grey cement business to improve following commissioning of new kiln at Mangrol, which may warrant a further re-rating of the stock.  Sonata Software  We like Sonata’s differentiated business model, focus on IP and platforms, high dividend yield, quality balance sheet, high RoE and no equity dilution for the past several years. Given its platform focus, investments made in IP and S&amp;amp;M, decent cash generation and reasonable valuation, coupled with healthy growth (19.6 percent EPS CAGR over FY18-FY20E), we believe there exists legroom for further upside, notwithstanding strong stock performance over the past year.

","Viswanath Pilla Moneycontrol News  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T), India’s largest construction and engineering company, is poised to meet the order guidance in FY19 led by strong order inflow in the fourth quarter, as Centre and state governments expedited contracts ahead of general elections and some state assembly elections.  The Election Commission of India announced the dates for Lok Sabha and some state Assembly elections. The elections will start on April 11 and continue until May 19. The counting will be held on May 23. As per the election code, the government is not supposed to announce any new projects ahead of elections, and refrain from awarding large contracts.  L&amp;amp;T had given a guidance of 10-12 percent increase in order inflows in the current fiscal year. The company had order inflow of Rs 1,52,908 crore in FY18. The order inflows as on December 31, 2018, stood at Rs 1,20,296 crore. L&amp;amp;T needs around Rs 42,000 crore in the fourth quarter to meet the FY19 guidance.  L&amp;amp;T stopped giving details such as the value of the order, it now classifies orders in four buckets such as significant (Rs 1,000-1,500 crore), large (Rs 2,500-5,000 crore), major (Rs 5,000 – 7,000 crore) and mega (above Rs 7,000 crore). Even at the lower band, L&amp;amp;T has won orders around Rs 35,000 crore in Q4FY19. It further needs orders worth around Rs 7,000 crore by March end to meet the target.  L&amp;amp;T hasn’t met its order inflow guidance in the last six years, but FY19 could be a different year led by public capital expenditure on transport, water, and transmission and distribution network.  Since the past few years, L&amp;amp;T's growth in order inflow was primarily led by government and public sector undertakings, while private sector investment continued to remain subdued.  Can it continue the momentum?  Despite strong performance so far in FY19, L&amp;amp;T is a bit circumspect, as there is a probability of slowdown in revenue and order intake during the subsequent quarters.  “We do think that there could be a bit of slowdown in the government machinery due to elections, ultimately our execution is based upon whether customers pay us on time or not. If they pay us on time, then we will go ahead and execute. If they delay payments, then we will obviously slowdown,” said Arnob Mondal, Vice President, Corporate Accounts and Investor Relations said in company’s Q3 earnings call in January.  But analysts aren’t too concerned about general elections impacting L&amp;amp;Ts future order inflow, as Central government share is now less than one-fifth of the total order book.  L&amp;amp;T’s management earlier said the central government accounts for a 15 percent share of current order backlog, whereas 29 percent is constituted by states and 37 percent by public sector undertakings (PSUs). The private sector is 20 percent of its order book.  “We look into the funding pattern of the key infrastructure projects in the country and find that from a mostly central government-funded pattern, it is gradually moving to a more diversified pattern where states, municipalities, multi-lateral agencies, and other quasi-government entities are becoming important,” Emkays said in its recent research report.  “This distributed funding pattern should protect central government capex from fiscal deficit woes and slowdown concerns relating to the 2019 General Elections,” the report added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/lt-poised-to-meet-fy19-order-inflow-guidance-on-pre-election-boost-3638821.html

SEBI had rejected the proposal in January on grounds that the group's secured and unsecured debts would be more than twice the paid-up capital and free reserves of the company, based on its consolidated financial statements after the completion of the share buyback programme.  A buyback is a corporate action in which a company buys back its shares from existing shareholders, usually at a price higher than the current market price. In simple terms, a buyback allows companies to reduce the number of shares outstanding in the market and increase the proportion of shares a company owns.  The market regulator's move sparked debate in the market, prompting the group to file a review application with the regulator.  &quot;If there is an error on the part of the regulator, the entity can always point out the error and ask the regulator to review its previous position,&quot; Sandeep Parekh, Founder, Finsec Law Advisors, told the paper.  If the company is still aggrieved, then it has the option of approaching the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), Parekh added.  L&amp;amp;T wants to complete the buyback within one year from the date of the announcement, sources told the newspaper. The company had announced the buyback plan on August 23, 2018.  This is probably the first time the regulator has raised the question of consolidated financial metrics versus standalone financial metrics, analysts told the newspaper.  As per SEBI's 2018 buyback rules, the ratio of aggregate secured and unsecured debt owed by the company after the buyback should not be more than twice the paid-up capital and reserves of the company. The rule, however, does not specify that the computation of the debt-to-equity ratio has to be on consolidated financials as was the case in L&amp;amp;T. The engineering behemoth had approached SEBI for approval of its share buyback proposal based on its standalone financial ratio.  L&amp;amp;T is also exploring other options. &quot;SEBI has written saying they don't approve the buyback as they see it. We are evaluating various options. The reason for rejecting is that they included the financial subsidiary. It's a bit harsh. We are studying it and will decide what has to be done,&quot; L&amp;amp;T’s CEO SN Subrahmanyan had said last month.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/lt-asks-sebi-to-reconsider-its-rs-9000cr-buyback-plan-report-3566081.html

They expect the stock to return 19-50 percent after December quarter earnings.  The stock was quoting at Rs 1,318.40, up Rs 32.85, or 2.56 percent on the BSE, at 0957 hours IST.  All brokerages said numbers for the quarter ended December 2018 were strong due to execution and had beaten expectations on order inflow as well as operational performance.  The engineering and construction major reported a whopping 37 percent on year growth in Q3 profit at Rs 2,042 crore and revenue grew 24.2 percent to Rs 35,708.9 crore on strong execution in project businesses.  &quot;Riding on strong execution in project businesses coupled with noteworthy performance in service businesses, the company registered a strong revenue growth of 24 percent YoY,&quot; the engineering and construction major said.  L&amp;amp;T secured orders worth Rs 42,233 crore at group level for the quarter ended December 2018, down 12 percent compared to Rs 48,130 crore reported in same period last year but remained steady against Rs 42,000 crore in September quarter. The company has retained its FY19 guidance for order inflow growth at 10-12 percent.  Operational numbers, too, were strong as consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 27.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,997 crore and margin expanded to 11.2 percent against 10.9 percent in year-ago.  Here is what all brokerages say about the results:  Jefferies: Buy | Target: Rs 1,925 | Return: 50 percent  The third quarter has beaten expectations on order flow and EBITDA and the biggest positive is the 24 percent YoY consolidated engineering and construction (E&amp;amp;C) revenue growth.  The prolonged delay in domestic capex recovery is the key risk to the stock.  CLSA: Buy | Target: Rs 1,730 | Return: 35 percent  The execution pickup without balance sheet sacrifice was commendable and we expect a further fall in working capital on recoveries at the Nabha IPP.  CLSA has a buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 1,730 apiece.  IDFC Securities: Outperform | Target: Rs 1,527 | Return: 19 percent  The strong third quarter performance was dented only by weak infrastructure segment. Improved domestic execution and domestic inflows were key positives during the quarter.  We expect buoyant 15/15.2 percent revenue/EPS CAGR for the company over FY18-21.  Kotak Institutional Equities: Buy | Target: Rs 1,530 | Return: 19 percent  We increased order inflow and topline estimates in core E&amp;amp;C segment given strong performance but cut margin by 60-80 bps given segmental margin weakness seen in nine-month of FY19.  Credit Suisse: Outperform | Target: Rs 1,700 | Return: 32 percent  The third quarter results were strong on execution and overall seemed to exceed expectations. However, results reflected weak EPC margins, particularly in the infra segment.  The brokerage house has made marginal EPS revisions and reiterated outperform rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 1,700 apiece.  Morgan Stanley: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,786 | Return: 40 percent  L&amp;amp;T's domestic &amp;amp; international revenues during the quarter grew 30 percent and 14 percent respectively. The company reported Q3 revenue/EBITDA/adjusted PAT growth 8/9/8 percent was above estimates.  Hence, we remained overweight on the stock with a price target at Rs 1,786.

The company will announce earnings on January 25.  Analysts expect revenue growth in the range of 12-16 percent year-on-year, largely driven by engineering &amp;amp; construction (E&amp;amp;C), IT and financial services segments.  Kotak and Edelweiss Securities, other brokerages considered for this poll estimates, expect the maximum 16 percent growth in consoldiated revenue.  &quot;We expect 11 percent YoY growth in core E&amp;amp;C revenues and 16 percent growth in consolidated revenues driven by IT and financial services,&quot; Kotak Securities said.  In infrastructure segment, it expects a strong 18 percent YoY revenue growth in Q3FY19 driven by opening segmental order backlog of Rs 2.2 lakh crore, which was up 15 percent YoY. However, it expects persistent weakness and YoY revenue decline in heavy engineering and power due to YoY lower opening order book.  Hydrocarbon may be able to report mid single-digit growth on the strength of existing order book, the research house said.  Hydrocarbon segment received one large order from ONGC in a consortium to develop a field in KG basin, which is likely to start contributing to revenues from next quarter onwards.

Kotak Securities expects the maximum 21 percent growth in EBITDA and 19 percent in EBIT with 50 bps margin expansion.  &quot;Margin would be a function of project execution stage and job mix. Considering first half of FY19 performance so far and management's assertion of 25 bps margin improvement for the whole year, we deduce higher core E&amp;amp;C EBITDA margin of 10 percent for Q3FY19. Overall consolidated EBITDA margin of 11.4 percent would increase 50 bps YoY,&quot; the research house said.  ICICI Securities also said EBITDA margin is expected to improve 50 bps to 9.9 percent in Q3 YoY while Antique Stock Broking and ICICI Securities see 18 percent growth in EBITDA.

In a regulatory filing to stock exchanges, L&amp;amp;T said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked it not to proceed with the buyback.  &quot;Since the ratio of the aggregate of secured and unsecured debts owed by the company after buy-back (assuming full acceptance) would be more than twice the paid-up capital and free reserves of the company based on consolidated financial statements&quot;, the buyback offer is not in compliance with the Companies Act and Sebi norms, the regulator said in a letter to the company.

The offer was open to those holding equity shares as on October 15.  A buyback reduces the number of shares available in the open market.  According to company sources, while turning down the proposal, Sebi has applied the financial ratio based on the consolidated financial statement of the company.  Brokerage: CLSA  The brokerage believes that the rejection of buyback will be a no setback to Return on Equity (RoE) expansion. It recommends buying the stock as it is a good proxy for domestic capital expenditure.  It also believes that the regulator is mistaken in looking at consolidated financials.  Further it believes that L&amp;amp;T’s board could approve a one-time large dividend of Rs 53 per share this week.

lt,2018-12-14T12:34:13+05:30,Kshitij Anand,Allocate 60-70% portfolio to equities with a bias towards small &amp; midcaps: IIFL Securities,"If one sees continued benign data on the inflation front, one can hope for increased liquidity from RBI, going forward, to support credit growth","  An aggressive person can invest 70% in equities, 20% in debt, and 10% in gold, whereas a person with a moderate risk appetite can invest 50% in equities, 35% in debt, and 15% in gold, Abhimanyu Sofat, Head of Research, IIFL Securities said in an interview to Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.  Edited excerpt:  Do you see RBI reducing rates in 2019 or a change in its stance?  The reduction in inflation forecast to 2.7-3.2% from 3.9-4.5% should have ideally lead to lesser hawkish monetary policy. As the shift in policy stance was done in the last meeting, it was difficult for RBI to reverse the same.  If one sees continued benign data on the inflation front, one can hope for increased liquidity from RBI, going forward, to support credit growth.  We believe even if the RBI does not act, bond yield will come down if the inflation is benign as aggregate demand and supply are more relevant than RBI rate. As we have seen earlier as well that despite RBI reducing rates in 2015-17, the transmission of rates did not happen.  Do you think the pain in the mid and smallcaps is here to stay in 2019 as well?  Since small and midcaps are down 35 percent (Nifty Smallcap 50) and 13 percent (Nifty Midcap 50), respectively, so far in 2018, there could arise an opportunity where you find good quality stocks at attractive valuations in these segments but avoid averaging stocks whose fundamentals have deteriorated significantly.  We are focused on stories, which are benefiting from crude price fall. Also, we are seeing some improvement in liquidity for NBFCs which will help in a rebound in credit growth helping these companies grow.  After a muted 2018, what are your predictions for 2019?  The market has more or less disappointed investors in 2018. The Nifty50 has merely given 4 percent YTD return till date. The rising crude oil prices, depreciating rupee and international trade tensions were some factors that affected the market in 2018.  However, in 2019, because of lower crude prices many macro challenges like currency depreciation, increasing CAD and inflation are getting resolved.  2019 strategy: Top five fundamental safe stocks which are good buys at current levels for a holding period of 1 year?  We expect the following stocks to perform well in the coming year (2019):  Indian Energy Exchange (IEX): To benefit from growing volumes in the short-term electricity market.  L&amp;amp;T Infotech (LTI): Strong client mining and deal win momentum would lead to the sustenance of top-tier revenue and earnings growth.  Axis Bank: To benefit from robust NII growth and a decline in loan loss provisioning.  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T): Improving the capex cycle and government thrust on infrastructure spending will be the key triggers.  Bajaj Finserv: To benefit from a higher share under the motor segment (general insurance), focus on customer retention, and increasing the absolute value of new business (life insurance).  Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in the coming year?  We are positive on capital goods and IT sectors. While capital goods stocks have not participated much in the recent rally, growth momentum is likely to be decent going forward considering the impact of the upcoming elections and on the assumption that private capex will make a return.  In the IT space, improving demand in America led by a pick-up in retail and the stability in the BFSI segment will support growth. The strong demand for digital solutions is also positive for the IT sector.  Do you think rupee will continue to appreciate in the near term?  We have already seen some recovery in the rupee over the past one month, primarily on account of the decline in crude oil prices. It will depend on the future direction of crude oil prices and the trend of foreign flows.  Also, the headwinds with regard to Brexit deal and trade wars will ensure that the volatility may rise, going forward.  Any sector(s) which you think could turn out to be dark horse in 2019?  The capital goods sector could be a dark horse in 2019 due to the possible easing of pricing pressure due to the return of private capex and pick up in order execution.  What should be the ideal strategy for investors for the next one year?  At any given time, one should invest based on their risk profile. There is no hard and fast rule; an aggressive person can invest 70% in equities, 20% debt, and 10% in gold, whereas a person with a moderate risk appetite can invest 50% in equities, 35% in debt, and 15% in gold.  A conservative investor should invest 50% in debt, 20% gold, and the rest in equities. However, from a tactical allocation perspective, one can increase weight in equities with a bias toward smaller &amp;amp; mid-cap companies.

lt,2018-11-28T14:21:15+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"Prefer small, midcaps over largecaps; corporate banks attractive for 2019 as NPAs peak out: ICICIDirect","The underlying macroeconomic growth coupled with corporate earnings growth momentum is likely to be a key catalyst for the market movement, says Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIdirect.com.","With worst of the asset quality concerns behind us in the banking space, pick up in industrial activity as well as robust consumer sentiment, we expect Nifty earnings to stage an impressive CAGR of 18.5 percent over FY18-20E to arrive at a target of 12,100, Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIDirect.com, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.  Q. What is the sense you are getting from markets?  A. The underlying macroeconomic growth coupled with corporate earnings growth momentum is likely to be a key catalyst for the market movement.  We note pick-up in industrial activity coupled with robust consumer demand both at the urban as well as the rural front remains the silver lining.  The resilient corporate earnings growth across most of the pockets is another positive. However, it is likely to be a volatile ride wherein we need to keep an eye on global tariff war news flows, crude volatility coupled with domestic macroeconomic factors, and election outcome.  Q. How did India Inc. perform in September quarter?  A. The Q2FY19 results were encouraging with nearly 20+ percent growth in the topline while margin compression amidst high commodity price led to muted bottomline growth.  Therefore, while the earnings have certainly picked up after near flat spell over FY14-18, the pace of growth is not too exciting. The earnings downgrade in Q2FY19 was largely contributed by the banking and auto space.  We, however, are of the opinion that we are nearing the end of earnings downward cycle. We expect Nifty earnings to stage an impressive CAGR of 18.5 percent over FY18-20E.   Q. Do you feel that FIIs are back in Indian markets?   A. With the sharp decline in crude prices (almost 30 percent in seven weeks), a key macro headwind for India has been addressed and the same is reflected in Indian rupee (appreciating over 4.6 percent in November, which is the strongest recovery in Asian FX).  With crude price outlook fading on excess supply concerns and the US Fed adopting a slightly dovish tone, strong EM stories have started to make comeback.  India is stacked well in the current set up and FIIs are likely to renew their focus on Indian Capital markets.  India continues to offer one of the highest positive real rates (accretive bond inflows) and equity markets have also cooled off over 10 percent from its record high in Jan 2018 and looking more compelling based on the forward growth projections.  Q. What are your views on the recently concluded board meeting of RBI and the government?   A. RBI and government in the board meeting finally concluded that an expert committee is needed to arrive at a consistent framework for RBI reserves requirement and thereby the transfer possible.  It indicates RBI is not rigid on transfer but needs the same to be decided by experts. Considering that the talks about the resignation of governor did not materialize, markets took it positively.  CCB buffer extension by one year was a marginal relaxation versus the demand to cut Basel III to align with international standards. Hence, it was largely a non-event.  Q. What are your expectations from the upcoming RBI policy meet in December?  A. RBI, in its policy meet in December is not expected to touch repo rate and a status-quo can be expected. The two most important variables after inflation are crude and currency that have now corrected from their peaks which provides the breather.  Therefore, unless core inflation sees a material upsurge, the upcoming monetary policy can be seen as a non-event.  Q. Given sudden appreciation in rupee, do you it is time to re-look at IT and pharma?  A. In the IT Space, as the demand remains healthy, it is mixed with caution due to talent supply crunch (leading to increase in localisation and subcontracting cost), rising employee costs in wake of high attrition and rupee appreciation.  Hence, we remain cautiously optimistic about the IT Sector.  We believe companies that have adopted higher localisation have a strong deal pipeline and valuation comfort will do well.  Similarly, on the pharma space, we remain positive on pockets which have posted upbeat Q2 earnings and are still below their fair valuations after the earnings upgrade.  Q. Do you think largecaps offer still a better bet compared to mid &amp;amp; small-caps?   A. We continue to like broader market over the largecaps. We also note the market is witnessing a strong divide in valuations across quality and ordinary businesses notwithstanding market capitalisation which warrants that investors should be stock specific now.  Emphasis should always be on buying a business that are run in a capital efficient way and possess sustainable growth prospects.  Q) What are the sectors according to you are recommending to your clients and why?   A. Among the sectors, we are positive on pharma (stabilised US, strong growth in India, improved margins), corporate banks (peaked out NPA cycle, asset resolution), IT (strong deal pipeline and valuation comfort) and capital goods (strong order inflows, improved working capital cycle).  Corporate banks remains one of the preferred sector to look forward to as the NPA cycle has peaked, while asset resolution also bodes well. We expect sharp earnings recovery, next year, on a benign base.  Q. What is your target for Nifty for the FY19?   A. Going forward, with worst of the asset quality concerns behind us in the banking space, surge in industrial activity as well as robust consumer sentiment, we expect Nifty earnings to stage an impressive CAGR of 18.5 percent over FY18-20E. We assign a P/E multiple of 19.0x to FY20E Nifty EPS of Rs 636 to arrive at a Nifty target of 12,100.  Q. Any top five stocks which you consider are a good buy at current levels after the recent fall from highs for a holding period of 1-2 years?   A. Our stock picks after Q2FY19 earnings are:  Aditya Birla Fashion &amp;amp; Retail Ltd:  ABFRL has delivered a superior performance in profitability terms for H1FY19, with EBITDA margins expanding 200 bps YoY and PAT coming in at Rs 48.3 crore versus net loss of Rs 30 crore in H1FY18.  We anticipate H2FY19 will perform better, particularly Q3FY19 on account of a shift in major festivals. We expect revenue, EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 14 percent, 24 percent, respectively, in FY18-20E.  Tata Steel:   We like Tata Steel for its integrated operations (100 percent iron ore and ~30-35 percent coking coal), which aids in clocking higher EBITDA/tonne vis-à-vis its domestic peers even in increased input cost scenario.  State Bank of India:  Given improving industry credit growth and a possible shift of business from NBFCs, SBI is best placed to ride the opportunity. We expect credit offtake to surge to 11 percent CAGR in FY19-20E.  The bank is also poised to benefit from the faster resolution of NCLT accounts. Pick-up in growth and focus on maintaining credit cost will result in sharp improvement in its earnings trajectory.  Indian Hotels:  The company plans to add 20 new hotels through management contracts that will further boost the topline, going forward. In addition, cost rationalisation and RevPAR growth are expected to drive margins in FY18-20E. Hence, we have a positive view on the stock.  L&amp;amp;T:  Given strong backlog, front-loading of order inflows, improving balance sheet quality (CFO generation), the company is well placed to deliver a 14.2 percent and 20 percent revenue and PAT CAGR in FY18-FY20E, respectively.

But L&amp;amp;T was more confident of its own fortunes and recently concluded a share buyback.  If there was any question at all, the company’s earnings for Q2FY19 should be answer enough. The stock is up 5 percent since the results announcement.  L&amp;amp;T had guided 12-15 percent revenue growth for the year, in the first half of the current fiscal year, it has already delivered 20 percent. Its order inflows have grown 42 percent to Rs 78,100 crore.  The management is confident that the company will maintain its growth rate in the second half of FY19, as execution continues to be high because of the general elections next year.  All round growth  L&amp;amp;T’s performance in the Q2 is worth noting. It reported strong growth in most of the segments it operates in.  Revenue from the infrastructure segment, which brings in the bulk of the company’s earnings, rose 22 percent on year as projects were implemented faster and execution improved.  The company also performed well in other important segment it operates in – hydrocarbons. Revenue from the segment, which  accounts for close to 12 percent of the overall pie, jumped 38 percent spurt as oil and gas companies spent more as capital expenditure.  The company’s performance in the power segment, which brings in 3.5 percent of its revenue, remained poor because of a lack of projects both in India and abroad.  Moreover, because of higher operating leverage and better pricing power in some of segments in which it witnessed strong traction, the company was able to report a higher operating margin.  During the quarter ended September, L&amp;amp;T saw its EBITDA margin improve by 50 basis points to 11.8 percent, which was reflected in the 20.2 percent increase in its net profit, which rose to Rs 2,023 crore.  Valuations and outlook   L&amp;amp;T is witnessing strong momentum in terms of project awards, largely from the government, in segments like infrastructure and others.  The company believes private sector capex is still low and is something to be monitored, given the ongoing liquidity crisis and the uncertainty before next year’s general elections. Nevertheless, with execution improving in key segments, it is seen ending the current fiscal year with a decent growth rate.  The company is sitting on an order book of close to Rs 2.81 lakh  crore, or about 2.4 times its FY18 sales. Assuming the growth trajectory remains good, at its current valuation of 22 times its FY19 estimated earnings, the stock is reasonably valued.

Brokerages estimate the profit after tax to be in the range of Rs 1,100-2,077 crore for the company in the quarter under review.  Here’s a gist of what multiple analysts are expecting from the company’s September quarter results announcement.  Brokerage: ICICI Securities | PAT: Rs 1,100.4 crore  The brokerage house highlighted the order inflows have been healthy at Rs 30,758 crore during the quarter under review. This order inflow has been front loaded, it said, considering more than 50 percent of the expected order inflow has already been received in the first half of this fiscal. This suggests a better execution rate in the coming year, analysts at the firm wrote in their report.  It sees revenues to grow 8.3 percent YoY to Rs 17,180.9 crore on a standalone basis owing to better execution rate. Meanwhile, operating margin is expected to improve to 8.7 percent.  “However, L&amp;amp;T can report one-off gains arising from profitability on sale of stake in its IT subsidiary companies.”  Brokerage: Motilal Oswal | PAT: Rs 1,460 crore  The brokerage house expects revenue to grow 10 percent YoY to Rs 26,300 crore.  The operating profit margin could expand 200 basis points year-on-year to 10.6 percent supported by Katupalli port transaction getting recorded in the quarter, excluding which margin would stand at 9.2 percent.  Further, it also highlighted that the company announced order intake of Rs 36,000 crore in Q1FY19 compared to Rs 19,200 crore in Q1FY18.  “Large orders worth Rs 264 billion were finalised during the quarter. Domestic order wins were supported by order finalisation in the water infrastructure segment. Overseas order finalisation was supported by the infrastructure and power segments.”  Brokerage: Kotak Institutional Equities | PAT: Rs 1,542.5 crore  For the core engineering and construction segment, the research firm expects steady 11 percent YoY growth off a low base for infrastructure segment (uptick in execution pre-GST).  The brokerage expects similar 12 percent overall revenue growth and core E&amp;amp;C EBITDA margin of 9 percent. This is a dip of 20 bps YoY as Q2FY18 had been impacted by one-offs (higher margin in the hydrocarbon segment).  Going forward, it expects a modest 6 percent growth in EBITDA for the consolidated entity due to low profitability of the Hyderabad metro.  Brokerage: Prabhudas Lilladher | PAT: Rs 2,077.4 crore  Prabhudas Lilladher is penciling in healthy execution, led by engineering and construction segments along with services section. It expects margins to improve by 30 basis points due to operating efficiencies and better margin in services business.

lt,2018-08-24T12:52:32+05:30,Jitendra Kumar Gupta,How L&amp;T’s buy-back could correct its faulty capital allocation &amp; reward shareholders,"Our calculations suggests that a Rs 9,000 crore buy-back would have an about 170 basis points impact on FY18 RoE","Jitendra Kumar Gupta Moneycontrol Research  Unlike many astute global investors like Warrant Buffett who have been able to deploy additional capital at far superior rate than the cost of capital, most owners and business managers fail. In such cases, returning money back to investors or shareholders is typically a tough choice. Many corporates instead end up deploying cash in unrelated and less remunerative activities. India’s engineering giant, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T), has made one such difficult choice and has announced a Rs 9,000 crore buy-back for the first time.  Rationalising capital Over the last 10 years, the company has generated a cumulative consolidated net profit of about Rs 53,385 crore. Of this, about Rs 11,350 crore, or 21 percent, has been paid out in the form of dividends and the rest (about Rs 42,000 crore) has been retained in the business. Over the last 10 years, it has added close to Rs 45,000 crore to shareholders funds, which stood at Rs 55,340 crore at FY18-end.    Where has this money been deployed? Back in FY08, the company had 81 subsidiaries, which has grown to 123 by FY17-end. Moreover, their contribution has been meagre. As against a cumulative net worth of Rs 5,468 crore in FY08, these subsidiaries had a net worth of Rs 53,000 crore in FY17, but recorded a profit after tax of Rs 2,724 crore. Close to 47 of these subsidiaries incurred losses of about Rs 2,175 crore. No wonder, the last 10 years average return on equity stood at 18.7 percent and an average of 14 percent in the last five years.    Cash correction Over the last couple of years, probably to rectify the same, the management has listed several of its subsidiaries, divested non-core businesses and sold or divested few capital intensive assets like roads, ports etc. This happened at a time when its core infrastructure and engineering business was generating a lot of cash. At present, the company is sitting on cash and cash equivalents of about Rs 8,500 crore on a standalone basis, generating treasury income. The latter may not be the purpose of a sound businesses and part of the internal cash has already been used to reduce its standalone debt-to-equity from 0.35 in FY15 to 0.21 times in FY18.  Buy back: Earnings accretive As the cash cycle is improving and burden of those capital intensive businesses is reducing, the share buy-back could turn out to be better strategy. Moreover, this aligns well with its long term objective of offering an 18 percent return on equity by FY21-end as against 16.04 percent in FY18.  How would a buy-back improve returns?    Our calculations suggests that a Rs 9,000 crore buy-back would reduce its consolidated net worth by 16.26 percent and thus have an about 170 basis points impact on FY18 RoE, which would work out to about 17.74 percent. At the current market price of Rs 1,352 per share, the stock is offering an earnings yield (earnings per share divided by market price) of close to 5.2 percent and a dividend yield of close to 2 percent, based on FY20 estimated numbers, totalling about 7.2 percent return on a constant earnings basis, which is quite reasonable.

Moreover, the government’s focus on speeding up the awarding of key projects before the election is leading to strong growth. The company maintains 10-12 percent order inflow guidance for the current year, most of which are expected to come in the first half or by the third quarter of current fiscal.  L&amp;amp;T is sitting on an order book of close to Rs 2,71,700 crore, which provides strong visibility in terms of the revenue growth and profits over the next two years.  It aims to improve its margins and return ratios and gradually divest from non-core businesses to deliver better returns for the shareholders. Thus, the growth trajectory remains fairly stable.  Robust operating performance  During the quarter ended June 2018, L&amp;amp;T posted 19% growth in revenues largely driven by growth in domestic revenues, which accounted for 65.8 percent of total revenue.  Its key infrastructure segment, accounting for 43 percent of revenue, delivered 9.7 percent year-on-year growth as a result of improvement in execution. Barring the power segment, merely 3.8 percent of the business, which showed a 39 percent decline, other segments such as heavy engineering delivered 29 percent growth, followed by a 37.4 percent growth in defence and a robust 38.5 percent growth in the hydrocarbon segment.  Hydrocarbon, which accounts for 12.4 percent of the total revenue saw strong revival as a result of higher oil prices and growth in capex. Interestingly, as a result of higher utilisations and cost optimisation among the different businesses, the company was able to record 142 basis points improvement in the EBITDA margins.  Most of the segments saw improvement in margins as a result of higher sales. Thus, during the June quarter, its EBITDA jumped by 40% on a year on year basis and resulted in net profit growth of 40 percent to Rs 1,200 crore.    Valuations: reasonably priced   L&amp;amp;T is expecting order inflows to remain strong in the run-up to the general elections in 2019. And with the execution improving and other businesses such as technology and finance making higher contribution, it should deliver double-digit growth in sales and earnings. In the current fiscal the company should report an EPS of about Rs 58 a share. At current market price of Rs 1324, price to earnings ratio works out to about 23 times, which is reasonable.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/q1-review-above-average-growth-helps-lt-post-strong-quarter-2764621.html

He advises investors to following a buy on dips approach.  Edited excerpts  Q) The Nifty on a weekly basis closed flat with a negative bias. What does the weekly chart pattern foretell? A) The Nifty is consolidating around the psychological 11,000 mark after breaking out above the 10,800-10,850 levels. Indications currently favour higher highs, however the upmove would be gradual from hereon, considering the limited participation from index majors. Technically, the Nifty should trade within the 10,800-11,300 range in coming week. We advise following a buy on dips approach.  Q) The rupee hit a fresh record low of Rs 69.13 per dollar on Friday. Where do you see the currency heading? A) The rupee slumped to a record low of 69.13 against the dollar tracking global factors like weakness in yuan, which China is using as a tool to cushion its economy against tariffs imposed by the US, as well as a surging dollar index and rising crude oil prices. Given the backdrop of an upbeat outlook for the US economy, the Fed seems to be on course for two more rate hikes this year, which have pushed the dollar index higher and is now weighing on the rupee as well.  Since crude prices have come off from their recent highs, it will provide some breather to the local unit, as also the fact that President Donald Trump has expressed concern about unwarranted strength in the dollar index.  Nonetheless, the overall trend for the domestic currency is skewed on the downside for now. Once the crucial support of Rs 69.20/$ is convincingly breached, the rupee may weaken towards Rs 69.80/$ levels in coming days.  Q) How is Bank Nifty looking on technical charts? Any other index which is showing strength? A) The Bank Nifty is showing resilience in line with the benchmark index while consolidating around its record highs. Private banking counters like Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, and HDFC Bank are helping the index sustain at higher levels, while the state-run banking pack is still facing selling pressure on every rise.  We believe a decisive breakout above 27,100 spot would trigger a fresh surge in the Bank Nifty, else it will continue to consolidate. On the downside, 26,400 and 26,000 would act as crucial supports for the index.  Apart from banking, FMCG and IT indices are also performing exceptionally well and are likely to trade higher over the next few days.  Q) Plenty of stocks hit fresh 52-week lows in July compared to those touching new highs. What should investors do with stocks hitting new lows -- hold or exit? A) We have hardly seen any respite in the broader market. The situation has in fact worsened in the past few weeks. However, the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices have reached closer to crucial support zones and are likely to see some pause followed by some rebound in the near future.  Investors should not give too much importance to intermediate price fluctuations and focus mainly on fundamentals. In short, do not mix investment with trading. We advise continuing with present investments and consider fresh investments as stocks are available at a good bargain with a medium to long term view.  Q) Top 3-5 positional call that could offer handsome returns to investors in the next 1 month? A) We are expecting volatile swings, thus it is advisable to maintain positions on both sides. Traders may consider fresh positions in the below stocks at recommended levels:  Century Textile and Industries Ltd: CMP: Rs 875.30| buy between 860-870| Stop Loss: Rs 830| Target: Rs 950| Return 8.5%  Lupin Limited: CMP: Rs 800.65| Buy: Rs 790-800| Stop Loss: Rs 765| Target 870| Return 8.7%  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Limited: CMP: Rs 1,263.65| Sell August Futures between 1270-1280| Stop Loss: Rs 1,315| Target: Rs 1,180| Return 6.5%  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
