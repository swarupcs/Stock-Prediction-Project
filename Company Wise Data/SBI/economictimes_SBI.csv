SBI,2024-05-07T00:30:00+05:30,Dheeraj Tiwari,PSBs set to develop road map for deploying GenAI systems,"According to sources familiar with the matter, state-owned banks are preparing to devise a comprehensive strategy and roadmap for implementing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems. Pilot projects are slated for launch within the current fiscal year.","State-run banks are set to develop a detailed strategy and road map for deploying generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems, with pilot use-cases to be rolled out within this financial year, said people familiar with the matter.The lenders will also establish AI-friendly policies and governance systems, focusing on capability development, they said, adding that the initiatives are key components of the reform agenda of the state-run banks for 2024-25. Banks will look to strengthen the data governance and analytics functions to drive specialised use cases,  said a bank executive, who did not wish to be identified.State Bank of India, the country's largest bank, is already exploring building its own large language model to leverage the data it possesses.  Each bank will develop its own strategy and look at collaborations. This will be part of the year-end assessment of banks,  the executive said. Bankers expect GenAI applications to play a significant role in credit modelling, data analytics and cybersecurity. Banks can use these new-age models to develop digital marketing capabilities and tech stacks to source business,  the executive said, adding that other use cases include engagement through social media listening activities to track share of voice, customer satisfaction and brand health. The new operating models can further improve operational efficiency and the quality of back-office operations,  the executive added.The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that GenAI could add $200-340 billion in value across the global banking sector annually, or 2.8-4.7% of total industry revenue, largely through increased productivity.  Another bank executive said that one of the cornerstones of the Enhanced Access and Service Excellence reform version 7.0, launched last month, is the adoption of new-age technology and other advanced capabilities.  Lenders will focus on digitally-enabled new operating models for cost optimisation and quality excellence,  he said, adding that the idea is to improve data quality and governance to increase the effectiveness of analytics use cases.Earlier, the government had asked banks to adapt to the evolving digital landscape, seeking to ensure that the integrity of domestic financial systems remains uncompromised.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/banking/finance/banking/psbs-set-to-develop-road-map-for-deploying-genai-systems/articleshow/109894774.cms

SBI,2024-05-06T00:32:00+05:30,Sugata Ghosh,Banks may challenge CBI's retro touch to fraud accounts,"Last year, the highest court had ruled that a borrower must be given a hearing before labelling the account as 'fraud'. Now, CBI, which is probing many of these cases, insist that the SC verdict stands for all fraud accounts - new as well as old cases - but banks assert that the SC ruling cannot be given 'retrospective' effect to cover borrowers listed as frauds before the ruling.","Mumbai: The wrangle between the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and high-street banks over crooked clients may soon boil over to the highest court. A few large banks are planning to move the Supreme Court to resolve the differences that have cropped up over borrowers that were tagged by banks as 'fraud accounts'.Last year, the highest court had ruled that a borrower must be given a hearing before labelling the account as 'fraud'. Now, CBI, which is probing many of these cases, insist that the SC verdict stands for all fraud accounts - new as well as old cases - but banks assert that the SC ruling cannot be given 'retrospective' effect to cover borrowers listed as frauds before the ruling.Many banks fear that seeking fresh response on past frauds from dodgy customers could not only mean treading a legal minefield, but even pose a challenge in locating such clients, with a few turning fugitive. The disagreement between the central agency and high-street banks is threatening to stall investigation in multiple cases. This is a matter which can only be resolved by the apex court. So, I believe a few of the large banks are planning to appeal before the Supreme Court for ruling out retrospective effect to the matter,  said Sunil Mehta, chief executive of the industry body Indian Banks' Association.  We have discussed the matter, but many feel this is the only way to go about it. SC should clarify,  Mehta told ET.Bankers have sensed, during their interactions with CBI officials, that the central agency would stick to its view that the ruling is applicable to future cases (where last year's SC ruling would be applied 'prospectively') as well as old cases (where the ruling would be used 'retrospectively' as the borrowal accounts in question were reported to the Reserve Bank of India as 'fraud' before March 27, 2023 when the SC gave its ruling).However, the SC also lays down that  no opportunity of being heard is required before an FIR is lodged and registered,  even as it says that the  principles of natural justice demand that the borrowers must be served a notice, given an opportunity to explain the conclusions of the forensic audit report, and be allowed to represent by the banks/ joint lenders' forum  before their account is classified as fraud under the RBI's Master Directions on Frauds.109864696Two senior bankers said that while many banks followed such a procedure, it was rarely documented. What's holding back the CBI from probing the matters? The SC ruling clearly says that no opportunity of being heard is required before an FIR is lodged and registered,  said a legal expert. However, according to a senior banker, the CBI won't act unless the matter has a criminal angle and this, it thinks, is established after an account is classified as 'fraud'.  Opinion is divided on the matter,  said a bank CEO.  CBI is playing safe in the light of the SC ruling,  said another banker. CBI may be driven by the stigma that comes with a 'fraud' tag which cheeses off a borrower's clients and investors alike - a point emphasised by SC. Besides, the agency, already loaded with cases, wants to stay clear of matters which could be legally challenged in future.The matter had reached SC last year following multiple civil appeals before the high courts, questioning the RBI's 'Frauds Classification and Reporting by Commercial Banks and Select FIs Directions 2016' on the ground that no opportunity of being heard is envisaged to borrowers (under this regulation) before classifying their accounts as fraudulent.  The appellants before the SC were then led by State Bank of India. So, it's possible that SBI may move the court again to seek clarification on the retrospective application of the ruling,  said another person.Over 95% of the frauds are about loans. Banks report Rs 3-25 crore to the CBI's anti-corruption bureau, alert the agency's banking cell for cases upto Rs 50 cr, and irregularities above Rs 50 crore are lodged with a CBI joint director.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/banking/finance/banking/banks-may-challenge-cbis-retro-touch-to-fraud-accounts/articleshow/109864685.cms

Voltas, Aditya Birla Capital, IREDA, and Schaeffler India have all risen over 30% gains during the reporting month.From the Sensex pack, banks have dominated the gains with Axis Bank and SBI occupying two spots out of top three. Mahindra and Mahindra was the lead gainer in the benchmark index with a gain of 12%.Sectorally, metals had seen a strong rally during the month by surging over 10%. The public sector enterprise (PSE) stocks have also had a decent run as the index jumped 10.5% in March.What to expect in May?Even though there is stability in largecaps, which are doing well currently, analysts said euphoria is building up in the run-up to the general election as the market is discounting a Modi victory. Post the elections, I do not think the market would have a lot of steam left to rally further because an NDA victory would be one of the greatest news for the market to shoot up significantly. So, one can play tactically right now and be bullish on the market,  said Aditya Arora, Adlytick. I think the market is also pricing in rate cuts, which is a positive which could create a significant short-term, medium-term top for the market,  Arora added.Within the broader market, if investors have to allocate money, Harendra Kumar of Elara Securities is looking to find opportunities in the midcap space. Midcaps more than the smallcaps have a longer runway in a bull market and historically, we have seen they tend to outperform largecaps. So, yes, a large part of your allocation should be in midcaps. And I think what technology and capital is giving the ability for the companies to morph much more faster,  he said.Sectorally, analysts see metals having more steam left in the rally despite a strong outperformance in the last couple of months. Metals are taking a breather now, but I believe there is much more room on the upside in the metal space as well. JSW Steel, Steel Authority of India, Hindalco look attractive,  said Aditya Agarwala of Invest4edu.(With inputs from Ritesh Presswala)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Markets witnessed phenomenal buying support as Sensex quickly moved towards the crucial 75K mark after investors cheered strong corporate earnings from select frontline banking and cement companies, indicating their smooth sailing despite the global vagaries.   Optimism prevailed from the start of the trading session as cooling of US bond yields and letdown in the Middle East conflict coupled with a drop in crude oil prices generated a lot of enthusiasm amongst the investors,  Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, said.

The public sector bank has raised governance concerns, in its letter said, that despite provisions in the Master Restructuring Agreement (MRA) allowing their retention until all dues are settled, the directors are excluded. The company, involved in a water treatment and supply project in Tirupur, Tamil Nadu, faced financial challenges leading to a Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) in 2011, restructuring debts totaling Rs. 575.34 crore.Following the restructuring, IDBI Bank and other lenders converted senior debt into equity, with IDBI Bank holding Rs. 6.11 crore in equity shares.

Let’s first understand how it is concluded whether a stock has seen a buildup of fresh long position or not. When a stock price moves up and the open interest on the counter follows the same, it is taken as a sign of a long buildup. The signal is considered more reliable if the volume on the counter has also seen an increase.SBI's stock price gained 2.95%, and open interest saw a rise of 0.51%.Zee Entertainment Enterprises price surged 3.05%, and open interest saw an increase of 0.49%.Axis Bank rose 2.59%, and the open interest saw an increase of 1.88%.Cummins India's stock rose 2.56%, and the open interest saw an increase of 1.59%.IndusInd Bank price jumped 2.29%, and open interest saw an increase of 2.14%.Also Read: F&O stocks to buy today: RIL, Axis Bank among top 10 trading ideas for 29 April 2024Some additional checks would help traders make better trading decisions as they increase the probability of a follow-up of the upward movement in the stock price. First, if this fresh long build has come when the stock is very close to its 52-week high, that increases the probability of the stock making an attempt to break its previous 52-week high.Second, if this long buildup is accompanied by any bullish crossover, which means in the current up move when the open interest has moved up, the stock price has been able to cross either its 20, 50 or 100-day moving average. Another couple of points which traders should keep in mind is looking at the matrix of buildup of long positions on the basis of open interest. Also, check whether there is any extraordinary buildup of long positions in any out-of-money call option, especially any far-of-the-money call option.

Further, they mentioned that there is still some lagged impact on the cost of funds, and they expect that they are closer to the bottom of the NIM profile.Here’s what brokerages say:NomuraAs asset quality woes continue, Nomura expects FY25 to be a difficult year. Profitability is also likely to be under pressure for SBIC for the upcoming year. Hence, Nomura has rated SBIC for ‘reduce’ with a target price of Rs 640.Morgan StanleyThe global brokerage firm rates SBIC as ‘equalweight’ with a target of Rs 750 as Morgan Stanley states that the industry grew at 20% YoY in March 2024 (likely because of the continued impact of RBI’s recent notification on corporate spending) , while SBI Cards’ growth was much slower at 1% YoY. Further, the company's market share also fell YoY and MoM to 15.2% for March 2024.UBSUBS has maintained a ‘neutral’ rating with a price target of Rs 805 as the credit costs continue to remain elevated and retail spending stays strong. The company’s lower opex drove PAT beat while the revolver mix improved slightly.Kotak Institutional Equities“The industry continues to show promising trends as card issuances are healthy and translation into spend growth leading to high RoEs makes this business attractive. However, the performance of SBI Cards has been far-from satisfactory. We do believe that a reversal of the current credit cost cycle could happen, which should aid in a sharp recovery in earnings. Also, interest rates are at peak levels and incremental NIM pressure is likely to be negligible”.KIE maintains a ‘buy’ view on the stock with a target price of Rs 900.ICICI SecuritiesThe company has faced several challenges over the last 4 years including higher credit cost during covid, higher cost to income during BNPL surge, structural decline in revolver mix, higher cost of funds post-covid and a higher cost of funds andcredit cost due to stress in unsecured lending accompanied by the increase in risk weights by the RBI. However, the company has still been able to deliver earnings CAGR of 34.7%/22.8% over the last 3/5 years.Backed by the above, ICICI has maintained its ‘add’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 820.InCred EquitiesSBI Cards continued to demonstrate a weak profitability trend amid falling margins and elevated credit costs. Post adverse policy action by the RBI, we expect a slowdown in card issuance and overall spending amid weak capital adequacy & deteriorating asset quality. We also expect its premium valuation to erode with growth slowing & profitability weakening.On these grounds, InCred advises to ‘reduce’ the stock with a target price of Rs 500.Axis SecuritiesThe credit card industry has been dealing with asset quality concerns for the past few quarters, largely driven by customer over-leveraging. To tackle the problem of over-leveraging, SBIC has taken multiple corrective measures and will continue to fine-tune policies and processes. The newly sourced portfolio (45% share of book in Q4FY24) has been continuing to perform better and as the share of this sourcing increases, SBIC is likely to witness portfolio quality improvement.

Global markets also lent support to sentiments back home.,"Indian headline indices returned to their winning ways after a one-day hiatus, led by strong buying action in banks. While the S&P BSE Sensex rallied 990 points to hit the day's high of 74,721.15, the broader Nifty50 climbed by over 230 points to hit 22,655 mark. Finally, the Sensex on Monday settled at 74,671.28, up 941.12 points or 1.28%, while Nifty 50 closed at 22,643.40, gaining 223.45 or 1%. Volatility remained high as India VIX closed at 12.24%, gaining 12% over Friday’s closing.Here are a few factors that led to the surge in Nifty and Sensex:1) Banks and financials shineBanking stocks which corner the highest weight in the 50-stock Nifty were trading with strong momentum. ICICI Bank, SBI, HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank were four of the top five index contributors today.The Nifty Bank index hit a fresh lifetime high today, rising 1,200 points. Barring IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank, the remaining 10 counters in Nifty Bank were trading in the green. PSU Bank Index also rose over 2.5% around this time with 11 stocks trading positive with a lone loser in Punjab National Bank (PNB).2) Global markets upbeatThe handover by Wall Street on Friday was positive with all three major headline indices ending strong. Nasdaq Composite finished Friday at 15,927.90, up by 316.14 points or 2.03% while S&P 500 closed at 5,099.96, gaining 51.54 points or 1.02%.

With the index unlikely to provide any breakthrough on either side, focus is likely to continue within side counters. Strength is seen even in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals space.

The tribunal found no error in fixing the liquidation value as of 30.09.2018, as per the RBI circular. Over 90% of lenders by value and 75% by numbers have already approved the ITPCL restructuring plan. ","Appellate tribunal NCLAT has rejected SBI's pleas opposing the liquidation value of ITPCL provided by the debt-ridden firm's lead banker PNB and said the country's largest lender cannot  wriggle out  the debt restructuring process of the IL&FS group's thermal power company.  The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has dismissed all three applications moved by SBI and said it does  not find any error in fixing the liquidation value as of 30.09.2018  of IL&FS Tamil Nadu Power Company Ltd (ITPCL).  The appellate tribunal observed that as per the RBI circular, an Inter-Creditor Agreement has been entered between the lenders.  Moreover, over 90 per cent lenders by value and 75 per cent by numbers have already approved ITPCL restructuring plan.  The lenders of ITPCL  with the requisite majority has already taken a decision to approve restructuring plan, the SBI, who is also one of the lenders, cannot be permitted to wriggle out of the terms of the ITPCL restructuring plan .   ... as per decision taken by the majority, prescribed in Clause 10 of the RBI Circular, the Restructuring Plan and the Liquidation Value taken therein is binding on the Applicant (SBI),  said NCLAT in its order passed earlier this month.  The RBI Circular mandates that Inter-Creditor Agreement has been entered between the parties, according to which any decision agreed by lenders with 75 per cent by value of total outstanding credit facilities and 60 per cent of lenders by number, shall be binding upon all the lenders.  ITPCL is an SPV (special purpose vehicle) incorporated by IL&FS to set up a 3,180 MW thermal power plant in Cuddalore District of Tamil Nadu. It currently has 1,200 MW (2x600 MW) operational. The project is being implemented in phases. Second phase shall have 3x660 MW.  The State Bank of India (SBI), which owns a minority/small part of around Rs 9,000 crore debt being restructured, had opposed the liquidation value obtained by PNB, saying that it was based as on October 15, whereas, it was to be calculated as on March 31, 2023.  The liquidation value provided by PNB was  five years old  and is of no use for it for taking a commercial decision on the implementation of the Restructuring Plan and is also  not in accordance with law , SBI had submitted.  SBI had requested NCLAT to direct PNB and ITPCL to calculate and provide liquidation value as on the date of execution of the Master Restructuring Agreement and to stay further distribution of fund and payout as per the approved restructuring plan.  However, SBI's plea was rejected by a two-member NCLAT bench which said:  The Liquidation Value as on 30.09.2018 is as per order dated 12.03.2020 where this Tribunal has accepted 15.10.2018 as the cut-off, we do not find any error in fixing the Liquidation Value as on 30.09.2018.   PNB has appointed two firms and both had submitted two different valuations of Rs 4,580.03 crore and Rs 6,188.66 crore, following which it has appointed a third valuer as per the rule and regulations.   The valuers' report was received by the lead bank (PNB) and thereafter third valuer was engaged due to difference in the valuation by the valuers and all the process was noticed and discussed in the joint lenders meeting. There is no dispute that liquidation value as per the valuers' report submitted by lead bank has been communicated to the applicant,  said the NCLAT order passed earlier this month.  During the proceedings counsel for PNB and ITPCL had submitted based on the Liquidation Value, in the event SBI clarifies its stand, SBI's share would be Rs 373.97 crore. SBI can still provide its 'consent' or 'dissent' to get entitlement as per the terms of the ITPCL Restructuring Plan.  Claims to the extent of Rs 555.57 crore from SBI was accepted by the Claims Management Advisor.  ITPCL has been categorised as an  amber  company. As per the road map for IL&FS, its group companies have been categorised into three categories -- green, amber and red -- based on their respective financial positions.  Companies under the green category are those that continue to meet their payment obligations.  IL&FS has a total of 302 entities of which 169 are domestic and the rest 133 are offshore.

However, these losses did not overshadow the weekly gains, which were fueled by a post-results rally in key index constituents and reduced concerns regarding the Middle East.","Domestic benchmark equity indices experienced a decline on Friday, primarily due to weakness in the financial sector. However, these losses did not overshadow the weekly gains, which were fueled by a post-results rally in key index constituents and reduced concerns regarding the Middle East.The NSE Nifty 50 was down 0.67% to 22,420, on the day, while the S&P BSE Sensex shed 0.82% to 73,730. Both the indexes snapped a five-day winning streak. However, for the week, the Nifty 50 and Sensex gained about 1.25% and 1%, respectively.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: The Nifty witnessed selling pressure throughout the day and closed weak for the day down ~120 points. On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty has faced selling pressure from the resistance zone of 22560 – 22625. Until this zone is not taken out decisively, we can expect the consolidation to continue. On the downside, crucial support is now placed at 22240 – 22200 where support parameters in the form of the 40-day moving average and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from 21777 – 22626 is placed,  said Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Nifty remained under selling pressure throughout the session as the index failed to sustain above the crucial level of 22500. On the daily chart, a dark cloud cover pattern is observed, indicating a potential bearish reversal. Immediate support is situated at 22300, below which the Nifty could extend its losses towards 22000. On the other hand, the level of 22500 might act as a technical resistance for the Nifty. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday's action:US Market Close HigherUS stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq registered their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2023. Benchmark S&P 500 snapped three weeks of losses, while the Nasdaq ended four straight weeks of declines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.40%, the S&P 500 gained 1.02% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.03%.European Shares Notch 1.8% Weekly GainThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 1.2% higher, notching up a weekly gain of 1.8%, its biggest since late January.The basket of STOXX 600 banks touched a nine-month high, aided by a 6.1% jump in NatWest after the British bank's first-quarter results.Tech View: Dark cloud cover candlestickNifty ended 150 points lower on Friday to form a dark cloud cover candlestick on the daily chart while the weekly one saw a high wave type candle suggesting consolidation in the near term.The short-term trend of Nifty seems to have reversed down after a reasonable rise from the lows. Immediate support is placed at 22300 and the weakness below this support could trigger more declines ahead. Immediate resistance is at 22625 levels, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.Stocks showing bullish bias:Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of HUDCO, Westlife Foodworld, Tech Mahindra, DCM Shriram, Lemon Tree Hotels, and Bank of Maharashtra among others.The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.
